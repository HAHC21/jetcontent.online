5469,"Answer These 4 Questions To See If You’re Eligible For Section 8 Homes","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Before you go through the trouble of looking for Section 8 homes for rent, you should know what the eligibility requirements are to receive a voucher.

Here are the basics, broken down into four main questions or criteria:
<h4>1. Are you a family?</h4>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of the Section 8 program. As such, they determine who is eligible to receive vouchers for affordable housing.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

One of the primary factors the HUD looks at in determining eligibility is whether or not you meet their definition of a family. While your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) has the final word on their family definition, here are some examples of what equals familial status:

A person or group of people who meet at least one of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>They have or do not have children.</li>
 	<li>They have been displaced from their home due to a natural disaster or a government action.</li>
 	<li>One or more people in the household are disabled.</li>
 	<li>At least one person in the household is older than 62 years of age.</li>
 	<li>A person who stays in the unit after their family who was receiving Section 8 assistance has left.</li>
 	<li>A single person who is not described by any of the criteria above.</li>
</ul>
As you can see, what defines a family in the HUD’s eyes can be quite broad. To get a better idea of your familial status and other Section 8 requirements, contact your nearest PHA office.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>2. Are you a citizen?</h4>
To get a voucher that can put you in a Section 8 home, you will also need to meet the citizenship status requirement. This means that you and your family members must either be citizens of the United States or have eligible immigrant status.

To determine eligibility in this department, you will be asked to provide documentation of your and your family members’ documentation, which can include:
<ul>
 	<li>A U.S. passport</li>
 	<li>Social security card</li>
 	<li>INS documents</li>
</ul>
Can a family that has eligible and non-eligible individuals based on citizenship still qualify for Section 8? Yes, but the amount of aid they can receive will depend on how many eligible members there are.
<h4>3. Is your family’s income low enough?</h4>
Section 8 housing was designed to aid lower-income families secure housing. For this reason, your family’s annual income must also fall below a specific amount to be eligible for a voucher.

The HUD creates income limits each year that are separated into the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Extremely low income – 30 percent of the median income for a location.</li>
 	<li>Very low income – 50 percent of the median income for a location.</li>
 	<li>Low income – 80 percent of the median income for a location.</li>
</ul>
Extremely low-income families are given priority over those in the other two categories. The number of family members (between one and eight) will affect the income limits in each case.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. Have you been convicted or evicted?</h4>
You will be disqualified from receiving a Section 8 voucher if you answer yes to either of the following questions:
<ol>
 	<li>Have you been convicted of using a residence in an assisted housing project to manufacture methamphetamine?</li>
 	<li>Within the past three years, have you been evicted due to drug-related criminal activity?</li>
</ol>
If you meet the four criteria above, you’re one step closer to eligibility for Section 8 housing. Remember, however, that your local PHA may also have their own requirements that you’ll need to pass too.","There are many Section 8 homes for rent that offer affordable housing.

5474,"Lower Your Next Energy Bill by Making These 4 Moves","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

What’s one piece of mail you never want to open, but have to? Your energy bill. Because while it may be high, failing to open and pay it will leave you and your family in the dark.

You may feel helpless when it comes to your electricity bill. You may feel as if it only goes up and never goes down. As long as you follow these simple tips, you can take control of your bill and watch it go down every month.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Cut Cooling and Heating Costs with a Programmable Thermostat</h4>
It may have an upfront cost that can put a dent in your wallet now, but installing a programmable thermostat can keep cash in your wallet later.

Having a programmable thermostat is ideal when you’re not home. Just program it, and it will automatically adjust your cooling and heating settings while you’re away.

For example, you can set the thermostat to 78 degrees during your work hours, since you won’t need your house to be so cool with no one in it. So it’s cool the minute you walk into your door after a long day at work, you can set the thermostat to 75 one hour before your arrival.
<h4>Optimize Your Energy Efficiency with Power Strips</h4>
Some electronic devices can use electricity even when they’re turned off. Over time, this unnecessary usage can add up. With a power strip, you can eliminate phantom charges on such devices by turning its switch off.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

To save even more money, put smart power strips throughout your home. They can manage electricity flow on devices in a logical manner.

For instance, your DVD player might be usable only if your television is on first. If it isn’t, the smart power strip will avoid any wasted electricity running to the player until the TV is turned on and the DVD player can be used for its intended function.

<h4>Adjust Your Hot Water Heater</h4>
Do you ever feel as if your water is too hot? Maybe you burn your hands when washing dishes, or it gets uncomfortably hot when in the shower. If so, it may be time to turn down the temperature on your hot water heater.

A big chunk of your family’s energy costs are linked to the hot water heater – 14 percent to be exact. By adjusting the temperature to a level that’s not so scorching, you can save your skin while saving money.

What’s an ideal temperature setting? Around 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Any hotter than that may not be needed.

Want to save even more on your hot water heating costs? Install a water heater blanket that will keep in the heat.

Like a programmable thermostat, the blanket has an upfront cost. As time passes, however, it will more than pay for itself by reducing waste.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Unplug Devices You’re Not Using</h4>
You probably know that turning off the lights, TV, or other devices when they’re not in use is a solid money-saving practice. What about unplugging them, though?

Since most devices draw electricity just from being plugged in, you should unplug them when they’re not being used. Avoiding these phantom charges can result in noticeable reductions in your monthly utility bill, especially if you have a ton of devices plugged in.","Want to see a lower energy bill in the mail?

5477,"The Pros And Cons Of Using Credit Cards As Personal Loans","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Whether you have just lost your job, had an unexpected emergency, or some other unfortunate event, needing quick cash can call for a personal loan.

There are several ways to get a personal loan, but what if you don’t want to go through all the trouble of doing so? What if asking a bank or online lender for a relatively small amount seems like more trouble than it's worth? Could a credit card save the day?

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

It may, and we’ll look at the pros and cons of using one when cash runs dry.
<h4>The Situation</h4>
For the purpose of this article, let’s assume that you need $1,000 to fix your car that needs a significant repair. As it stands, it does not run, and this makes getting to and from work on your long commute almost impossible. In short, you cannot delay another day in getting the repair.
<h4>The Pros of Using a Credit Card for a Loan</h4>
In this hypothetical situation, you could charge the $1,000 to the card, provided the repair shop accepts it. If your card has an introductory APR of zero percent interest for 12 months, you could get instantly get that loan at virtually no cost. As long as you pay it off before the 12 months are over, you should be good to go.
<h4>The Cons of Using a Credit Card for a Loan</h4>
What if the shop only accepts cash? In that case, using a credit card may not be such an affordable option.

Sure, you could get the money instantly without having to do much legwork in the form of researching lenders and filling out applications. However, cash advances from cards often have high interest rates.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

If your card has no promotion that offers zero interest for 12 months, the cost of using it to charge the repair will be higher. Credit cards usually have higher interest rates than loans, and if you have bad credit, your APR may be much higher.

Beyond high interest rates, adding a major expense to your card could hurt your credit, especially if you must max it out. Keep this in mind before pulling the trigger.
<h4>Other Options</h4>
What should you do if your card has a super-high interest rate and a costly cash advance? Instead of using it for your loan, seek lending from another source.

You can get a personal loan from various options, such as a bank, credit union, or an online lender. The lower your credit score, the more you’ll end up paying for the loan, but if it’s a better option than a credit card, go for it.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

Before settling on a loan, do your due diligence to ensure the lender is trustworthy. Banks or credit unions are often safer in this regard.

Searching for an online lender should involve a visit to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) database. It contains up-to-date complaints on financial products that could protect you from bad lenders looking to steal your money or data.","Seeking a lender for a personal loan may seem like too much work when you have a credit card sitting in your wallet.

5480,"7 Car Maintenance Tips to Help You Save Money in the Long Run","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Keeping your car maintained properly may seem costly at first, but it could cost more if you fail to do it and expensive repairs arise as a result.

What do the dentist and the auto repair shop have in common? Both are places where nobody wants to be. Unfortunately, if you own a car, you will find yourself in a repair shop at least once, unless you’re extremely lucky. How can you make yourself less known to the local mechanic? By ensuring your car is running at its peak.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Since car maintenance is a must when it comes to expenses, let’s look at seven ways that it can keep money in your pocket over time. In other words, let's frame it in a positive light, so you're more likely to keep things up to date with your automobile.
<h4>Inflate your tires</h4>
You don’t want to overinflate them, but keeping your tires inflated at their recommended pressure can reduce inflation at the gas pump.

If you check your tire pressure regularly, you can save hundreds of dollars per year on fuel. Every pound of under-inflation counts, as just a one-pound difference can result in a six percent loss in gas mileage.
<h4>Balance your tires</h4>
Getting your tires balanced at least once a year is a great way to keep the mechanic away.

What happens if you don’t get them balanced? You can damage your suspension, accelerate the wear and tear on your shock absorbers, and reduce the mileage on your tires.

Balancing on a routine basis can add thousands of miles to your tires’ lifespan, decreasing the need to buy new ones so frequently. For this reason alone, ask for a balance when you get that occasional oil change.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Opt for steel-belted radial tires</h4>
This type of tire is a gas-saver. Putting them on your car can boost your gas mileage by 10 percent annually.
<h4>Don’t skimp on oil changes</h4>
Want to extend the life of your engine? Get your oil and oil filter changed every 3,000 miles.

Yes, this may go against advice from those who say you don’t need oil changes so often, but the more frequently you get them, the less risk you run of having to pay for a major repair later on.
<h4>Get tune-ups</h4>
You want your car to run optimally like the beautiful machine it is. A tune-up can help you achieve this goal, and it can also cut fuel expenditures too.

How much of a difference can routine tune-ups make? A rather massive one, since a car that is poorly tuned can burn up to 33 percent more gas per year.
<h4>Keep an eye on the air filter</h4>
You don’t necessarily need a costly mechanic to keep your car’s air filter clean. You can check it every month to ensure it’s clean, and a quick blow with an air hose should help it look like new.

The cleaner your air filter, the likelier your engine lives longer. It can also improve your gas mileage, which is a money-saver in itself.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Watch those fluids</h4>
You can extend your car’s life and increase the efficiency of its parts by checking fluid levels routinely. If you don’t know how to do it yourself, ask your mechanic for the favor.

Automatic transmission fluid, clutch and brake fluid, coolant, and battery water should all be monitored.","Here are seven ways that car maintenance can save you money in the long run.","2021-08-30 13:27:40",post,https://housing-relief.com/7-car-maintenance-tips-to-help-you-save-money-in-the-long-run/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1162238476.jpg,shutterstock_1162238476.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1162238476.jpg,5481,"Concept,No,Money,:,The,Male,Car,Owner,Holds,An",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1162238476.jpg,Home,,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,7-car-maintenance-tips-to-help-you-save-money-in-the-long-run,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-31 13:09:26"
5483,"Could You Qualify For Habitat For Humanity Housing?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

You’ve probably heard about Habitat for Humanity and know the gist of what it does, but how well do you really know it?

If you’re like most, you probably don’t know much about Habitat for Humanity beyond hearing their name in the news or commercials. In fact, you may think they just give away free homes to those in need on a random basis.

The truth is, Habitat for Humanity is a housing program that you could even qualify for. It’s not necessarily for the impoverished, nor do they give away “free” homes.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

To see what it takes to secure Habitat for Humanity housing, let’s discuss some of the basics.
<h4>What Habitat for Humanity Does</h4>
To understand what Habitat for Humanity housing was meant to do in a nutshell, look no further than this quote from their official website:

“Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit organization that helps families build and improve places to call home. We believe affordable housing plays a critical role in strong and stable communities.”

As you can see, they not only build new homes for families, but they also improve existing ones to make them more livable, safe, and efficient.

If you were to hire a real estate agent to show you homes, they would likely pick places that are too big and expensive for your budget. Habitat for Humanity, on the other hand, prefers to build homes that are small, easy to maintain, and that result in lower monthly utility bills.

In short, if you’d like to own a home but are scared of the costs, Habitat for Humanity housing could be right up your alley, as long as you’re eligible.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Eligibility Requirements for Habitat for Humanity Housing</h4>
Since Habitat for Humanity operates globally in over 70 countries and the entire United States, its eligibility requirements vary. Eligibility is determined on a local basis, but here are some of the basic requirements you could run into:
<ul>
 	<li>You must be a legal resident.</li>
 	<li>You must have decent credit.</li>
 	<li>You must have a stable income.</li>
</ul>
If eligible for Habitat housing, you will not be gifted the home. You will be expected to pay a mortgage on it via monthly payments, and a small down payment will likely be necessary.

Your income cannot be too high or low to be eligible for a Habitat house. You can find out your local requirements by searching the Habitat for Humanity site.

Beyond making your mortgage payments on time, something else is required to own Habitat for Humanity housing: sweat equity.

You will be expected to build your home or someone else’s with volunteers. This requirement is a staple of the Habitat program, but if you are unable to perform physical labor, you can complete homeowner classes or volunteer in other ways.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

No construction experience is required to build a Habitat home, but you will have to put in some time. In Los Angeles, California, for example, 200 hours of sweat equity are required.

While this may seem like a lot, you are getting the opportunity to own a home while helping others, which makes it all worth it.","Moving into your own home could become a reality much quicker than you think if you qualify for Habitat for Humanity housing.

5486,"How Do Section 8 Waiting List Preferences Work?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

<h4>What Is a Waiting List Preference?</h4>
If a Public Housing Agency (PHA) uses waiting list preferences, it means that they give priority placement to housing voucher applicants with specific characteristics.

For instance, one PHA may have homelessness as one of its preferences. If a person is homeless, they may receive a housing voucher quicker than someone who isn’t.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Some waiting lists do not have any preferences, while some may have many. It all depends on the location. How do they determine which preferences are used and when? Usually, by the community in question.

If one community has a large homeless population, it may use that preference to distribute housing vouchers. Meanwhile, if another has no homeless people, they may not use it as a preference.

Waiting lists that have more than one preference may assign point values to each. The applicant with the most points may receive the most priority, which can help them wait less to receive their voucher.

You can find out which preferences your waiting list uses by contacting your PHA. The more preferences you have that apply to your household, the better. This is why finding out which ones are used is crucial.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>How Are Waiting List Preferences Applied?</h4>
To have a preference used in your favor, it will need to apply to the head of household, spouse, or co-head. You will need official documentation to prove that you qualify as well.
<h4>Examples of Waiting List Preferences</h4>
As stated, preferences will vary according to location. Here are some of the most common ones you may see:
<ul>
 	<li>Homeless – To be considered homeless, some PHAs say you must be living in a shelter. Living with friends or family does not qualify. As with other preferences, contact your PHA to see the specifics.</li>
 	<li>Living in substandard housing – If your home has no plumbing, no kitchen, no heat, is unsafe electrically, or has similar characteristics, it may be seen as unfit for living or substandard.</li>
 	<li>Disabled – If you receive disability benefits, cannot live independently, or could be helped by more suitable housing, this preference may apply to your situation.</li>
 	<li>Displaced by disaster – If a federally declared natural disaster like a flood displaced your household from their home, this preference could move you up the waiting list.</li>
 	<li>Domestic violence victim – Living in a domestic violence shelter or having legal documentation of this issue could qualify.</li>
 	<li>Burdened by rent – Paying more than 30 percent of your income (sometimes it’s 50 percent) could classify you as rent-burdened, which is a preference that often carries high priority with vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Displaced by government action – Cuts to housing authority funding, code enforcement, and other government actions that displace families are sometimes given waiting list preference.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

The list of waiting list preferences doesn’t end there, but you should now get a clearer picture of what can help you receive your housing voucher sooner than others.

If any of your PHA's preferences apply to your situation, be sure to use them to your advantage.","Since the Section 8 waiting list for housing vouchers is usually long, you want to do everything in your power to speed up the process.

5490,"8 Moves To Make If You Can’t Pay The Rent Right Now","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

<h4>1. Talk to your landlord.</h4>
The sooner you let your landlord know your issues, the better. One silver lining to the coronavirus outbreak is that you’re certainly not alone when it comes to lost income.

Since so many people have been laid off or can’t go to work, your landlord won’t be shocked if you tell them there may be a problem with the rent this month.
<h4>2. Write a hardship letter.</h4>
A formal way to get on your landlord’s good side during these tough times is to send them a hardship letter.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

In the letter, you describe your financial issues and explain why you won’t be able to pay the rent. If you don’t want to write it from scratch, you’ll find plenty of rent hardship letter templates online.
<h4>3. Negotiate a payment plan.</h4>
You may not have all of the rent at this moment, but that could change in the next few weeks, especially if you qualify for a stimulus check that may be on the way.

If your landlord doesn’t let you skip the rent, they may let you set up a payment plan to pay it off in separate installments as you get paid.

Again, the COVID-19 outbreak makes the reality of such an offer being accepted much higher since people around the globe are suffering financially.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>4. Try to lower your rent.</h4>
While you may have money troubles at the moment, your landlord may have them too. Even if you can’t pay your entire rent, they may accept a reduced amount, so they have some cash flow.

Discuss lowering your monthly rent, at least temporarily, to make your payment more manageable for the time being. You can do this through a simple phone call or in-person, or by writing a letter to reduce your rent payment.
<h4>5. Look at your lease.</h4>
Does your lease have a hardship clause? If so, it could relieve you of your responsibilities and let you break your contract due to your financial troubles.

A hardship clause usually won’t let you skip rent payments. It could let you move out, however, without having to pay any penalties so you can cut your costs almost instantly.
<h4>6. Find rental assistance.</h4>
Although the demand for rental assistance is probably sky high right now, you may be able to find the help you need via local or national programs.

Your best bet to find such programs is probably online. Search for your city or county name along with rental assistance.

If nothing comes up, you could also try to find something on the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>7. Know current eviction laws.</h4>
Since the coronavirus’s economic impact is so widespread, many states have ordered a stop on evictions. This currently applies to HUD-owned properties, so look to see if you’re protected until you get your financial situation squared away.
<h4>8. Cut other costs.</h4>
Many companies have paused billing in response to the coronavirus. If your utility bills do not have to be paid, you could use that saved money towards your rent.

You could also call companies to see if they’ll let you skip this month’s payments due to COVID-19.","Is your housing situation on shaky ground?

One expense that cannot be avoided, however, is food. Here’s how SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, can help ensure that your family stays fed.

When money runs low, what do many people do? They look for ways to supplement their income, either by working extra hours or finding a second job.

Unfortunately, the coronavirus outbreak has made such moves extremely difficult, as a majority of businesses have temporarily closed down to help with social distancing.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

If supplementing your income via work isn’t an option, what’s your next move? Making tough decisions on where your remaining money should go. And while you could put bills like your cable and phone on the backburner, the same can’t be said for food.

Although coronavirus stimulus checks and unemployment compensation may soon save the day, you should try to boost your household’s resources as much as possible. And when it comes to food, SNAP may be one of your best options.

If you’ve never applied for SNAP benefits before, this brief guide will give you a background to how this food assistance program works so you can apply as soon as possible.
<h4>The SNAP Application Process</h4>
Applying for SNAP is accomplished on a state level. As such, each state may have its own specific requirements and application forms. To contact the SNAP office nearest you, go here.

Applying for SNAP is usually done via in-person visits, over the phone, or online. Due to the coronavirus, the government is shifting towards less face-to-face contact, so you may find that you can apply without having to leave your home.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

If you want someone else to apply on your behalf, they can do so. You will have to designate them as your authorized representative, however, in writing.

When you apply for SNAP, the process usually begins with contacting your state agency and completing and submitting your application.

While your application is processed, which usually takes 30 days, you will have to verify the information you provided. You will also have to complete an interview.

Once everything is complete, you will be sent a notice that will tell you if you were accepted or rejected for SNAP benefits.

Some cases may be processed in less than 30 days. For instance, you may become eligible within seven days if your housing and utility expenses exceed your monthly gross income and liquid resources. Or you can become SNAP-eligible within a week if your liquid resources are less than $100, and your monthly gross income is less than $150.
<h4>SNAP Eligibility</h4>
Your state will determine your eligibility according to income and other factors. Since
requirements may differ between states, contact your local agency for specifics.

Besides income, work may be used to determine your eligibility, although that may change due to COVID-19. Typically, some states require SNAP applicants or recipients to at least try to find work or participate in state-assigned employment and training classes.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>SNAP Benefits</h4>
The amount of SNAP benefits you receive (allotment) will depend on how many people are in your household and your income. Ask your state agency to provide you with a benefits chart.

If accepted, your SNAP funds will be distributed onto an EBT card. You can use it like a debit card to buy groceries at specific food stores and retailers.","Job and income loss from COVID-19 has made it impossible for many families to meet their monthly expenses.

5499,"Walgreens vs. CVS: Which Has The Better Drugstore Rewards Program?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

We’ll dive deeper into what each has to offer so you can decide who deserves your business.
<h4>What Is a Drugstore Rewards Program?</h4>
As its name suggests, a drugstore rewards program offers up bonuses in the form of discounts and other incentives in exchange for your loyalty. How does this benefit the store? By keeping you coming back instead of going to their competitor.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Do all drugstores have the same rewards? Of course not, as each has its own unique setup, which we’ll discuss in a minute regarding Walgreens and CVS. Most do operate similarly, however, in a format that’s something like this:
<ol>
 	<li>The store signs you up to their program for free.</li>
 	<li>You accumulate points to your account by making purchases, filling prescriptions, performing health-related tasks, etc.</li>
 	<li>You convert your points into discounts or dollars that can be used to buy items from the store, either in-person or online.</li>
</ol>
With that out of the way, let’s look at the details of what Walgreens and CVS have to offer with their drugstore rewards programs.

Keep in mind that what you see listed may differ according to your location, and there may be exceptions as to what you can buy with your accumulated rewards. When signing up, pay attention to all of the details.
<h4>Walgreens Balance Rewards Program</h4>
Like many drugstore rewards programs, Walgreens’ version awards points according to your spending with the store (10 points/$1 spent online or in-store, to be exact). In addition, however, it also emphasizes making healthy choices and rewards you for them.

The healthy choices part of its rewards program offers incentives like:
<ul>
 	<li>250 points to promise you’ll stop smoking.</li>
 	<li>20 points to track daily progress in your quest to no longer smoke.</li>
 	<li>250 points to actually quit smoking.</li>
</ul>
Other healthy choices you can convert into rewards include:
<ul>
 	<li>20 points per each mile you bike, walk, or run.</li>
 	<li>20 points each day you log your sleep activity, blood pressure, weight, etc.</li>
 	<li>250 points for synchronizing your account with an activity tracker.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Regarding purchases or other tasks whose rewards you can redeem at either Walgreens or Duane Reade, here’s the breakdown:
<ul>
 	<li>1,000 points equal $1 that can be used for purchases.</li>
 	<li>90-day prescriptions = 300 points</li>
 	<li>30-day prescriptions or immunizations = 100 points</li>
</ul>
As long as you redeem your points within 12 months or don’t let your account go inactive for six months, you’ll be good to go.
<h4>CVS ExtraCare Pharmacy &amp; Health Rewards Program</h4>
CVS rewards loyalty via ExtraBucks that you can use towards in-store or online purchases. Here are the basics:
<ul>
 	<li>10 credits = $5 ExtraBucks</li>
 	<li>90-day prescription = 3 credits</li>
 	<li>Filling/refilling a prescription = 1 credit</li>
 	<li>Vaccines = 1 credit</li>
 	<li>Electing to get notifications via text/email = 1 credit</li>
 	<li>Signing up for online prescription management = 3 credits</li>
</ul>
You can earn a maximum of $50 ExtraBucks per year. Any rewards you earn expire at the end of the year.

Who has the better drugstore rewards program between Walgreens and CVS? Both have their advantages, so that’s really up to you to decide, although being active may get you more rewards via Walgreens’ program.

If so, you’ll be glad to know that there are lenders that can give you the financing you need, even if your credit history is less than clean.

Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to have perfect credit to get a loan. This is excellent news for those with hiccups on their history who still need reliable transportation.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h3>Getting a Car Loan With Bad Credit</h3>
Will you have to put in more work to get favorable financing if your credit is bad? Yes, but at least getting that financing is a possibility, as long as you follow these steps.
<h4>1. Check your credit score.</h4>
It’s a good idea to know exactly where you stand in terms of your credit score before applying for a loan. You can do this by getting a free copy of your credit report, which can be done at no cost once a year.

Once you see your score, you’ll be able to match it to the different types of loans that are out there.
<h4>2. Increase your credit score.</h4>
The higher your score, the easier it is to get a loan. And despite how bad you think your situation may be, you can raise your score by making these moves:
<ul>
 	<li>Check your credit report for any errors and dispute them.</li>
 	<li>Pay any past due amounts on your bills.</li>
 	<li>Pay down any open credit card balances to improve your utilization ratio.</li>
 	<li>Start paying the bills that you have on time.</li>
 	<li>Don’t open any new credit accounts.</li>
</ul>
If you see any negative items on your payment history, contact the company involved and see if they will remove them. It’s a shot in the dark, but it can work and increase your score.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. Figure out how much you can afford.</h4>
Create a monthly budget that factors in your income and expenses. Using that, estimate how much of a car payment you can realistically afford so you don’t get in over your head.

Once you have your monthly payment in mind, it becomes easier to figure out how much car you can purchase.
<h4>4. Compare lenders.</h4>
There are plenty of lenders that offer car loans for bad credit. Before sticking with one, you should see what the competition has to offer in terms of interest rates.

Keep in mind that the bigger the down payment you make, the better the interest rate, as you’ll be seen as less of a risk. It can also make the difference between getting approved and rejected.

As you shop around, don’t worry too much about inquiries hurting your score, as you have 14 to 45 days to look for loans. Use this time to your advantage and remember that the inquiries will count as one.
<h4>5. Get a pre-approval.</h4>
You’ll be better prepared and can save time if you get pre-approved for a loan. It will also give you a more exact idea of how much car you’ll be able to buy. To get pre-approved, information like your income, expenses, credit report, and credit score will be analyzed.

If you get rejected, look into getting a cosigner that has a stable income or credit history. Using a cosigner may result in loan approval, but they will be responsible if you fail to make payments.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h3>Examples of Auto Loans for People With Bad Credit</h3>
Here are some lenders that specialize in bad credit auto loans:
<ul>
 	<li>RoadLoans – Good if you have a bankruptcy in your past that has been discharged.</li>
 	<li>New Roads – Worth a look if you have poor credit, bankruptcy, or repossession in your past, but still want a low interest rate without making a down payment.</li>
</ul>
Another option if you have bad credit would be to purchase your car from a buy here, pay here dealership. You can also look into second-chance or subprime car loans that are an alternative when regular lenders reject you.","Do you feel like it will be impossible to get a car loan due to your bad credit?

5505,"Simple Tricks To Save Big On Your Water Bill","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

If you need to cut your monthly costs, your water bill is an excellent place to start. Follow these simple tips, and you’ll be well on your way to achieving that goal.
<h4>Change Your Faucets and Showerheads</h4>
Do you have several people in your home? Here’s a solid way to reduce water consumption.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

You’ll incur some upfront costs by replacing your faucets and showerheads now, but the water you save over time will be worth it.

WaterSense certified products are known to lower water consumption and make your home more efficient overall. Install some in your home, and you should see that water bill go down.
<h4>Watch How You Wash Clothes</h4>
Many newer washing machines and detergents are so capable that you don’t need to wash clothes as thoroughly anymore. If you use more than one rinse each time you run your machine, cut back. You can also reduce how much detergent you use without seeing much of a difference.

Unless you have clothes that are entirely soiled or someone is sick, cold water will do the trick while saving energy in the process. If not, feel free to use hot water when needed, but not all the time.

Lastly, wash clothes when you have a full load. It will save energy, water, and detergent.
<h4>Use the Dishwasher Instead of Your Hands</h4>
Do you have a dishwasher in your kitchen that’s collecting dust? If so, it’s probably because you think it’s a water and energy hog.

Believe it or not, using a dishwasher is more efficient when it comes to water consumption, and it can even do a better job at cleaning.

To make the most out of each wash, ensure you have a full load.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Try Running Your Machines at Night</h4>
Some utility companies vary their charges according to the time of day. For this reason, running your dishwasher and washing machine at night could help you cut costs.

When it comes to washing dishes, running nighttime cycles can help since you can start the machine right after dinner. Without having to rinse the dishes beforehand since the dishwasher will be running soon, you’ll save some extra water in the process.

How can you tell if you get charged more during the day? Call the company in question or go to their website to find out. If it doesn’t work for your water bill, try it with your power bill.
<h4>Improve Your Toilet’s Efficiency in a Matter of Minutes</h4>
There are plenty of water-saving toilets on the market, but you may not have the spare cash to buy them. No worries, as you can make your existing toilets more efficient with a super-simple trick.

Take two plastic soda bottles and fill each with a couple of inches of pebbles. Add water to each bottle until they’re full and tightly close their lids. Then drop them in your toilet tank without blocking any critical moving parts, and you’re good to go.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

By having these homemade devices in your toilet’s tank, you can save water with each flush. Over time, this should result in significant savings and will keep you from having to worry about flushing so much.

As a bonus, making use of plastic bottles instead of throwing them away helps you recycle, which helps the environment.","Are you looking for ways to save money every month?

The WIC program can offer food assistance, as long as you meet its four main eligibility requirements.

Food stamps (now formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are just one way to feed your family when times get tough. Another is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

To qualify for WIC food assistance, you’ll need to meet these four eligibility requirements:
<h4>1. The Categorical Requirement</h4>
As its name suggests, WIC was created to help three main categories of people:
<ul>
 	<li>Women</li>
 	<li>Infants</li>
 	<li>Children</li>
</ul>
Women qualify for WIC if they are pregnant. Their eligibility period will run during pregnancy and six weeks after it ends or the baby’s birth.

Women also qualify during the postpartum stage, which is up to six months after the pregnancy ends or the baby’s birth.

Lastly, women who are breastfeeding can get WIC food assistance up to the infant’s first birthday.

Beyond women, infants are eligible for WIC up to their first birthday, and children are eligible up to their fifth birthday.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>2. The Income Requirement</h4>
A WIC applicant’s income must sit at or below a standard set by the state they live in. This is usually somewhere between 100-185 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines. These guidelines are set annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource-files/WPM-2020-4-WIC_IEG_2020-2021-Memo_corrected_508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">You can view them here</a>.

There’s another way to determine income eligibility as well, and it’s automatic. If a WIC applicant participates in particular programs, they can become automatically eligible for food assistance.

Automatic eligibility is usually tied to the receipt of the following benefits:
<ul>
 	<li>SNAP</li>
 	<li>Medicaid</li>
 	<li>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</li>
</ul>
If family members meet eligibility requirements for Medicaid or TANF, that could result in WIC approval, as could eligibility for certain benefits programs offered by the state.
<h4>3. The Residential Requirement</h4>
To fulfill this requirement, you will have to live in the state you are applying in if you wish to receive WIC benefits. If you live in an area where WIC is handled by an Indian Tribal Organization (ITO), you will have to meet its own residency requirements.

Luckily, there are no specific time requirements for residency. In other words, you don’t have to live in an area for a certain period before applying for WIC.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. The Nutrition Risk Requirement</h4>
WIC clinics offer free nutrition screenings by health professionals to determine if an applicant has a nutrition risk. This requirement can also be filled with information from the applicant’s physician.

To meet the nutrition risk requirement, an applicant can have either medical-based conditions, such as anemia or being underweight, or dietary-based conditions, such as a poor diet.

There are several other examples of medical and dietary-based conditions. The applicant must have at least one of them to qualify. At the very least, height and weight will need to be documented, and blood must be checked for anemia.

To get started with applying for WIC benefits, <a href=""https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">use this Prescreening Tool</a>. It only takes about 15 minutes to complete. If you qualify, WIC food assistance could give your household a nice dietary boost while helping you save money.","Have you found that putting food on the table has become too complicated as a result of COVID-19?

5517,"Should You Try Distance Learning To Get Your Degree?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

With distance learning, it sure is. But is such a setup right for you? Keep reading to find out.

Why distance learn? The real question should be, why not? Sure, you may miss out on in-person, classroom interaction with others. But if your only goal is to get your degree, distance learning could be the most straightforward way to get it.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

If you’ve been on the fence about distance learning, this article may convince you that it’s the way to go. With that out of the way, let’s look at the bevy of benefits distance learning brings.
<h4>The Costs</h4>
Money (or lack thereof) is what usually stands in most people’s way of getting their degree. When you study online, there are several ways to reduce your costs to make your education more affordable.

You may be wondering if scholarships exist for distance learning, as they usually seem to go to traditional, on-campus students. Well, there’s no need to wonder, because there are plenty of scholarships available for distance learners too.

Here are some places where you can start to inquire about distance learning scholarships:
<ul>
 	<li>Your school counselor or department of study (if you’re already a student in high school or college).</li>
 	<li>Financial aid office.</li>
 	<li>On-campus alumni offices.</li>
 	<li>Family members or friends (via their workplace or unions).</li>
 	<li>Scholarship book directories.</li>
 	<li>Online search engines.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Snag several scholarships, and you can make a nice dent in your distance learning tuition. But what about the other costs?

When studying at home, you can cut tons of costs associated with transportation, housing, and even food, which makes it much more affordable than taking the traditional student route.

If you have children, the savings distance learning brings is even more significant. You won’t have to worry about hiring an expensive sitter if you can sit at home and study while watching the kids yourself. This also allows for more quality time and bonding, which is something that you cannot put a price tag on.
<h4>The Convenience</h4>
You’ll be hard-pressed to hold a full-time job if you’re a regular on-campus student. When you distance learn, though, you can still work to provide for your family. How? By studying when it fits into your schedule, as distance learning is very flexible and customizable.
<h4>Fewer Limits</h4>
By getting your degree online, you can study anywhere. You’re not limited to options in your area, which is great if you live far away from everything.

As mentioned, distance learning is flexible. This doesn’t just pertain to scheduling, however, as it’s also reflected in your studies.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

Whether you want to earn a degree regardless of where you are or decide what and when you will study, this online setup gives you the power to do just that.

Now that you see the benefits that distance learning can bring, do a quick online search for scholarships to see what’s available. As you start to see potential savings and opportunities, you may realize that now is the time to begin your online college career.","Is it really possible to get a degree without stepping foot in a classroom?","2021-08-31 05:33:08",post,https://housing-relief.com/should-you-try-distance-learning-to-get-your-degree/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1297544911.jpg,shutterstock_1297544911.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1297544911.jpg,5518,"Happy,Young,Woman,In,Headphones,Speaking,Looking,At,Laptop,Making",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1297544911.jpg,"Benefits Assistance",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,should-you-try-distance-learning-to-get-your-degree,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-31 05:33:08"

Ask a single parent what their number one priority is, and they’ll probably say their kids. Since COVID-19 hit, you’ve probably held your kids a little closer, and you may have also come to this realization: Money is running low.

What can you do when money runs low? You could look for a job, but how can you work when the kids are stuck at home? You could hire a sitter, but they may cost more than you make.

As you already know from firsthand experience, caring for a child on your own has always been tough. And as you can see from that issue above, the coronavirus outbreak made it ten times tougher due to job and income loss and the closure of schools.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

There has been some help with the freezing of evictions, stimulus checks and unemployment from the CARES Act, and so on, but that help eventually runs out. What doesn’t run out? You need to keep putting food on the table, regardless of what’s going on.

There is help out there, especially when it comes to food. And if you’ve looked around on your own with no luck, give the following tips a try:
<h4>1. Call the Hunger Hotline.</h4>
If you’ve ever called a hotline before, you know they exist for one primary purpose: To help with emergencies. That’s what the USDA National Hunger Hotline does, and you can call it when your kitchen starts to look empty.

Food assistance is just one call away, so dial 866-3-HUNGRY on Monday through Friday to see if this can fix your situation. The hotline’s hours of operation are from 7 am to 10 pm Eastern time.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>2. Contact social services.</h4>
Making this move may help you kill several birds with one stone. Since COVID-19 has led to crises with much more than just food, calling your state’s social services can help you find nutritional aid for your kids, child care, and more.

To connect with your local social services contact, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">visit this site</a>.
<h4>3. Watch the news.</h4>
While you may have strayed from the news because it all seems negative as of late, you may want to start paying closer attention to it. Whether it’s by turning on the TV, keeping tabs on your local news’ website or Facebook page, or picking up a paper, you can find COVID-19 food assistance that changes daily.

Food drives and local charities are popping up all the time, and your local news is the best way to find when and where they will appear. As with most resources during these uncertain times, supplies are limited. In other words, when you see a food site advertised, don’t waste time visiting it. Also, be prepared for long lines.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. Use the 211 service.</h4>
Dial 211 on your phone, and a local operator can tell you where local food distribution sites are.

5523,"How To Pay Less For Electricity Without Sacrificing Comfort","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Or you could apply for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and get the government to pay part of your bill.

If you’ve researched ways to lower your electric bill, you may have come to this conclusion: It can be a lot of work. Some say you should do things like buying a programmable thermostat to keep your AC from running when you’re not home. Others say you should install insulation, seal leaks around doors and windows, and make other home improvements that could cost quite a pretty penny.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Besides investing time and money in making your home more energy-efficient, sacrificing comfort is another suggested method of paying less for electricity. But do you really want to freeze or sweat to death in your house just to save a couple of bucks a month? Probably not.

With that being said, what’s an easier way to pay less for electricity that doesn’t involve a ton of work, investing money you don’t have, or giving up your comfort? The answer is LIHEAP, which is a program from the federal government that can help pay the heating or cooling costs that can make your energy bill skyrocket.
<h4>An Overview of LIHEAP</h4>
As you noticed in the intro, LIHEAP stands for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. As you can tell by its name, the program is intended to help low-income households with their energy bills.

Unfortunately, you cannot depend on LIHEAP to handle all of your utility bills, which means that besides any cooling or heating costs, the following will still be your responsibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Water (unless it’s somehow linked to your AC usage)</li>
 	<li>Sewer</li>
 	<li>Telephone</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

To give you an example of how specific the program is, let’s say you use gas in your home. If you do not use it for heating purposes (usually in the winter when it’s cold), and you only use it for hot water or cooking, LIHEAP will not pay that portion of your bill.
<h4>LIHEAP Payments</h4>
Should you qualify for the program, LIHEAP will pay your utility company directly. It is not intended to be used every single month, either. Although this can change depending on your location, you can usually apply for LIHEAP benefits up to three times annually. In other words, don’t expect utility assistance every month.
<h4>LIHEAP Eligibility</h4>
The federal government may be in charge of funding LIHEAP, but the program’s administration is handled on a state level. As such, the eligibility requirements may differ according to where you live. Regardless, here are some prerequisites you’ll likely have to meet to be eligible:
<ul>
 	<li>Be a resident of the state you’re applying in.</li>
 	<li>Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or qualified alien.</li>
 	<li>Have a gross income in your household below 150 percent of the federal poverty level.</li>
 	<li>Be responsible for the payment of your household’s cooling or heating bills.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Applying for Benefits</h4>

COVID-19 has led to record job loss. This has led many to lose income, causing them to face financial trouble. If you’re one of the many negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, you may feel stressed about feeding your family.

Before you go hungry, know that there are options out there that can quickly offer food assistance. We’re not talking about food stamps, either, as you will have to apply and wait a bit for those to come through. Instead, we’re talking about emergency food assistance in the form of free meals, food pantries/banks, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

There are several ways to find food pantries and other nutritional resources for families in need. Today, we’ll focus on three websites that can help you find what you’re looking for with just a few minutes of research.
<h4>Use Feeding America for Both Short and Long-Term Food Assistance</h4>
Feeding America has quite the directory on its website. With over 60,000 food pantries and 200-plus food banks, you should have no trouble finding free meals during the pandemic.

What about safety, though? What if you’re worried about social distancing, picking up food from other people, and being exposed to the coronavirus? Is using such a site to find food pantries safe?

It sure is, as Feeding America assures you that many food pantries, meal programs, and food banks have prioritized the safety of their participants. This means you can enjoy low or no-contact options when picking up your food.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Some food pantries have drive-through setups. Some have hours specifically set aside for seniors. Others, meanwhile, offer home delivery so you can stay inside without worrying about exposure.

As for how to use Feeding America to find food pantries and the like, <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/need-help-find-food"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">go here</a>. Type your zip code into the field under “Find Your Local Food Bank,” and click go. After you see a list of options, click on each to learn more. Be sure to contact as many options as possible so you can maximize the food assistance you receive.

Although the emergency food assistance a pantry can provide is excellent, why not get long-term help while visiting the Feed America site?

You’ll find it <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/need-help-find-food"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here by scrolling down</a>. There are many options to suit different nutritional needs, such as helping families with children or teenagers, or helping those with young children or infants. You can also find help if you have any family members over the age of 60 or have special needs.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Other Options for Finding Emergency Food Assistance</h4>
While you could technically solve your COVID-19 food issues via Feeding America, other sites are worth visiting as well. They operate similarly and are easy to use.

The first alternative is <a href=""https://www.foodpantries.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Foodpantries.org</a>, which will show you food pantries by state and then city. The second is Ample Harvest, which lets you <a href=""https://ampleharvest.org/find-food/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">choose a radius during your food pantry search</a> to find as many opportunities as possible.","Don’t let COVID-19 cause starvation in your household.

5529,"See If You Have Unclaimed Property Now","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Have you ever heard of stories where people receive considerable checks in the mail? If so, you probably thought it was a hoax, but it can be true in some cases.

Unclaimed property is a real thing, and it relates to 10 percent of the population. Why would someone allow property to sit there unclaimed? Let’s take a look at how it works, which we’ll follow up with some tips on how to see if you have any funds that are waiting to be claimed.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>How Unclaimed Property Works</h4>
Unclaimed property comes in various forms, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Tax refunds</li>
 	<li>Dividend checks</li>
 	<li>Utility deposits</li>
 	<li>Money orders</li>
 	<li>Gift certificates</li>
 	<li>Credit balances</li>
 	<li>Customer refunds</li>
 	<li>Payroll checks</li>
 	<li>Stocks</li>
 	<li>Bonds</li>
 	<li>Mutual funds</li>
 	<li>Contents of safe deposit boxes</li>
 	<li>Military medals</li>
 	<li>Escrow accounts</li>
 	<li>Old bank accounts</li>
 	<li>Retirement benefits</li>
 	<li>Life insurance policies</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
Such property can be in your name or come from a deceased family member. As for why it would be unclaimed, the reasons are numerous. For instance, you may have forgotten about a work check or didn’t cash it. You may have received a refund, but forgot to claim it. Or a relative may have passed, leaving you some property, but it was never properly distributed.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Regardless of the property, each state has an unclaimed property division that aims to return it to its rightful owner. Someone may have tried to contact you to achieve this goal, but you may have been impossible to reach due to moving, changing your phone number, etc.

If a specific amount of time (usually 1-3 years) passes where you cannot be contacted, that property gets labeled as unclaimed or abandoned. It then gets turned over to the state. How do states finally turn it over to you and other rightful owners? By setting up websites that allow you to search for unclaimed money and ultimately claim it.

With that out of the way, let’s look at how you can claim your lost money via two very easy to use websites.
<h4>Missing Money</h4>
As its name suggests, <a href=""https://www.missingmoney.com/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Missing Money is a website that allows you to pinpoint lost funds</a>. Think of this as a national search for unclaimed money that lets you save time.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

Why would a national search be advantageous? Because you could have unclaimed property in various states that you either lived or did business in. If that’s the case, Missing Money can locate them without having to do several searches separately on state sites.

To get started, just enter a name. You’ll then see results listing the amount due, who the property is from, and more, plus how to claim it.
<h4>National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators</h4>
As mentioned, unclaimed money goes to the state. To find it, you can also go to the individual state website and do your search there.

You can find your state’s site by <a href=""https://unclaimed.org/search-for-your-unclaimed-property-its-free/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going here and clicking on the map</a>. Once at the state’s website, follow the directions to perform your search and claim any property you may have.","One in 10 people have property with their name on it, but don’t even know it.

5555,"What Does It Mean When You Default On A Loan?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

When you take out a mortgage to buy a house or get some other type of loan, you make a promise to pay it back. When you don’t pay it back on time and fail to live up to that contract’s terms, you default on the loan.

As you might expect, defaulting on such a serious obligation isn’t viewed in a positive light. Now let’s dive deeper into the topic to see why you should avoid having a default on your record at all costs.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h3>The Consequences of Loan Defaults</h3>
Almost any loan you take will be attached to a contract. This legal document binds you to specific terms, and when you sign it, you agree to those terms.

A closer look at the contract should reveal the consequences of not doing as promised. Most of the time, those consequences equal legal action taken against you that can put you in a financial bind in both the short and long term.

Here are some examples of the consequences that come with defaulting on a loan as a consumer:
<ul>
 	<li>Late fees</li>
 	<li>Negative reports to bureaus that can decrease your credit score</li>
 	<li>Collection procedures</li>
 	<li>Lawsuits</li>
 	<li>Wage garnishment</li>
 	<li>Repossession</li>
 	<li>Foreclosure</li>
</ul>
Should your situation become dire enough, any combination of the above could cause you to file for bankruptcy. You could also lose tax refunds and see smaller social security payments in the future if you default on one particular type of loan, which we’ll discuss shortly.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

In short, a loan default puts a massive dent in your reputation as a borrower, making it harder for you to find financing years down the road. This can reduce your flexibility when it comes to buying things you need, and it can increase how much you pay out of pocket for specific items.
<h3>Defaulting on Personal Loans</h3>
<h4>Mortgage Loans</h4>
You could lose your home if you default on a mortgage. The lending company or bank can file a Notice of Default to evict you and foreclose on the house if you can’t bring your payments up-to-date.

Being evicted does not completely get you off the hook, either. You can still be liable for expenses that arise from the process, such as if the home is sold for less than the loan’s value.
<h4>Student Loans</h4>
Defaulting on a student loan can haunt you to retirement since it can result in losing tax refunds or lower social security payments.

Luckily, many student loan lenders will work with you to come up with options to manage your obligation should you lose your job, have no income, and more. Before letting your student loan default, talk with your lender to let them know your situation.
<h4>Car Loans</h4>
Missing car payments can result in repossession. As with a mortgage, losing your car doesn’t completely get you off the hook.

If your vehicle is sold at auction for less than what you owe, you’ll have to pay the difference and any other expenses. If you don’t, you will likely face legal action.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Defaulting on Credit Cards</h4>
Miss one credit card payment, and you will have to pay late fees. Miss two minimum payments, and your annual percentage rate (APR) will increase. A report or your delinquency will also be sent to the three major credit reporting bureaus, which can negatively impact your score.

Beyond the financial punishments, your peace of mind will be impacted via collection calls. If you reach the 90-day point without paying, you may receive a settlement offer from the credit card company.

If you don’t accept the company’s offer and six months pass, a loan default will occur. From here, the company can turn your account over to a collection agency. Your credit score will suffer, and you may be sued.","What happens when you default on a loan? Is it as bad as it seems, and how can it impact your financial future?

An upside-down or underwater loan is one where you owe more than the car is worth. This negative equity can be quite common nowadays due to longer-term loans and depreciation.

If your underwater auto loan has you feeling submerged, we’ll take a look at some solutions. But first, let’s see if your loan is upside down in the first place.

<h3>How to Tell If You Have Negative Equity in Your Car Loan</h3>

You can find the current value of your car by visiting the Kelley Blue Book site. Edmunds offers a similar service, as does the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). Since each site may vary in terms of estimated value, take the average of all three to come up with an official number.

Do not use the loan’s principal amount in the calculation. Use the loan payoff amount instead, as it includes taxes and other fees still owed.

As an example, if your car’s value averages out to $13,000 and your loan payoff is $15,000, you have $2,000 in negative equity. In other words, you owe more than your car is worth and are in an upside-down loan.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h3>How to Get Rid of a Car with Negative Equity</h3>
While being in an underwater loan isn’t ideal, it’s not the end of the world. Here are your options if you’re looking to get into a different vehicle:
<h4>1. Pay down the existing negative equity.</h4>
If you have some extra cash, use it to pay off the negative equity. Doing so gets yourself out of debt and above water so your next car won’t feel like such a burden.
<h4>2. Sell the car personally.</h4>
The Internet makes it easy to sell a car from the comfort of your couch. By selling it yourself, you can make more than you would by selling it or trading it in to a car dealership.

Ask people you know if they’re in the market for a car. Post it on Facebook. Head over to Craigslist and list it, or use a site like Cars.com or Autotrader. All are solid options to try before losing potential money on a sale via unloading it at a dealership.
<h4>3. Trade in the car.</h4>
If there are no buyers for your car, you may want to trade it in. When you do, any amount you owe in negative equity will be tacked on to your new loan.

While this may seem like a quick fix, it comes with problems of its own. The dealership could charge a fee for making the move, your new loan could be larger than you’d like, or you could pay a higher interest rate. In short, you could trade an old financial trouble for a new one.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

How can you combat these issues to make a negative equity trade-in less troublesome? You could downgrade to a car that isn’t as expensive. You could also shop around for a pre-approved car loan that carries a lower interest rate than what the dealership can offer. Lastly, shortening the term of your new loan could result in lower interest, although your monthly payment will be higher.

Depending on what car you choose, you could get a boost from a cash-back offer. If the discount is significant enough, you could use it to pay down your old loan’s negative equity.

Another option is to go from owning to leasing. Your lease payments will be higher from adding negative equity into the equation. However, you won’t get into a brand new loan that is likely underwater from the start due to your past loan’s negative equity.","Do you feel stuck with a car you don’t want that has an upside-down loan?

5561,"6 Reasons You Keep Being Denied Credit","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Getting a loan application denied is a frustrating experience. Instead of focusing on that frustration, however, it’s best to find out the reason for your rejection.

While every credit case is unique, here are some of the most common reasons why people are denied loans:
<h4>Lack of income</h4>
It will be tough to get certain loans if you cannot prove you have the ability to pay them back. Home loans fall into this category, and the law requires such lenders to calculate your ability to pay before approval.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

What happens if you’re denied due to a lack of income? You’ll need to find ways to increase your income, such as through side gigs or a second income, to get approval in the future.
<h4>Lack of credit</h4>
Having no credit history can knock you down a few notches in the eyes of creditors. They want to see a stable pattern of paying on time, but without any history, you won’t be able to show that.

If you’ve just started building your credit history, you may need a bit of time under your belt before you get approved for any significant loans.
<h4>Bad credit</h4>
Have you defaulted on any loans in the past? Do you miss payments regularly? Any issues that lead to bad credit can make it challenging to acquire new credit.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Too many inquiries</h4>
If you are in a rush to get credit, don’t make the mistake of applying for every card under the sun. Doing so could lead to denial, even if you’ve been approved for other cards.

When you apply for several credit cards or loans at once, creditors could see it as a red flag that you have financial issues. The more issues you have, the riskier a borrower you may be, and the less likely any loan will be repaid on schedule.
<h4>High debt to income ratio</h4>
Do you have a ton of outstanding debt? If so, creditors may feel that you’ll have trouble paying any newly-acquired debt, which could result in rejection.

If it doesn’t look as if you’ll be able to pay new debt after looking at your income, a creditor will be wary of you as a customer. Remember, their main goal is to ensure you can make payments. Excessive debt makes that goal much harder to achieve.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Other reasons</h4>
Since each case is unique, there may be less common reasons that lead to getting your application denied. This can happen with mortgages, for instance, if an appraisal is too low and doesn’t match the desired loan that is much higher in value.

Although the reasons for rejection listed above apply to most cases, you should always ask your lender why you were rejected. They will usually tell you the reason, which can tell you what must be fixed now to get accepted in the future.","Are you tired of submitting loan applications that get rejected? Before you submit any more, find out why you’re getting denied in the first place.","2021-08-31 20:22:04",post,https://housing-relief.com/6-reasons-you-keep-being-denied-credit/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_8587831.jpg,shutterstock_8587831.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_8587831.jpg,5562,"A,Crumpled,Up,Home,Loan,Application,(stamped,With,The,Word",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_8587831.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,6-reasons-you-keep-being-denied-credit,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-31 20:22:04"
5568,"How To Find Food Assistance Via The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

The government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can help you achieve that goal. Here are some frequently asked questions and answers on how it works.
<h4>How do you apply for SNAP?</h4>
Applications for SNAP are processed through states and not on a federal level. You will have to apply for benefits in the state where you currently reside.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Each state differs in terms of its process and application forms, which is why you’ll need to contact your local SNAP agency to apply.

You can find your state agency by going here. As you learn more about their procedures, you may find that you can complete an application online.

It’s important to note that SNAP requires some sort of direct contact from the applicant. In other words, if you don’t have Internet access, cannot visit your local office, or cannot call them, someone else will have to do so in your name.

This person will be your authorized representative. They must be designated in writing to apply or interview on your behalf.
<h4>Who is eligible for SNAP?</h4>
Benefits are distributed based on need. If you meet your state’s SNAP income and other requirements, you may be eligible.
<h4>What is the SNAP application process like?</h4>
Most states have an application process as follows:
<ol>
 	<li>You complete and submit your application.</li>
 	<li>Your local SNAP office or state agency processes it, usually within 30 days.</li>
 	<li>During those 30 days, you must offer proof of the information in your application and complete an eligibility interview in person or over the phone.</li>
 	<li>You receive a letter that tells you whether or not you are eligible.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

If you are eligible for SNAP, your benefits will be dated back to when you submitted your application.
<h4>Are there any cases when you can get SNAP benefits faster?</h4>
In some cases, you may become eligible for snap within a week if you meet certain hardship requirements, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Your rent or mortgage and utilities exceed your household’s monthly gross income and liquid resources.</li>
 	<li>Your household’s monthly gross income is less than $150, and your liquid resources are less than $100.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How are SNAP benefits distributed?</h4>
If eligible, your benefits will come via an EBT card. It functions like a debit card and can be used at authorized retailers and food stores for groceries.

Each month, your card will be automatically loaded with funds.
<h4>How long do SNAP benefits last?</h4>
This depends on your certification period, which will be listed on your notice of eligibility. Before that period ends, you will receive another notice telling you to recertify to continue receiving benefits.
<h4>How much can I receive from SNAP every month?</h4>
Your SNAP “allotment” depends on your income and the number of people in your household. Contact your local agency to see a benefits chart.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Do you have to work to be eligible for SNAP?</h4>
Some work requirements may exist, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Accepting a job, if offered.</li>
 	<li>Participating in state-assigned training and employment courses.</li>
 	<li>Not quitting a job or reducing hours voluntarily.</li>
 	<li>Registering for work.</li>
</ul>
Exemptions to this may include pregnant women, seniors, children, or those who have specific mental health or physical issues.","Regardless of whether you have the money to do so or not, putting food on the table is a number one priority.","2021-08-31 20:37:30",post,https://housing-relief.com/how-to-find-food-assistance-via-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_299082896.jpg,shutterstock_299082896.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_299082896.jpg,5569,"Woman,Buy,Products,With,Her,Trolley,At,Supermarket",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_299082896.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,how-to-find-food-assistance-via-the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-31 20:37:30"
5571,"6 Ways To Save When Eating Out","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

As you look for ways to pinch pennies with your monthly budget, entertainment expenses like eating out are often the first to get cut. This can be a real drag if you love getting out of the house and going to restaurants.

Are there ways to maintain your restaurant hobby without breaking your budget? There sure are, and here are some that you can start practicing now:

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>1. Share your meals.</h4>
Have you seen the food portions at restaurants lately? Some are big enough to feed an army, which is why sharing your meals is the best way to minimize your dining expenses.

The benefit of sharing meals goes way beyond just saving money, as it can save you the extra pounds that come from all of those extra calories.

If you don’t feel like eating from the same plate, ask the waiter to bring out two plates. Many restaurants will gladly split orders to accommodate you.
<h4>2. Let your kids eat free.</h4>
Tons of restaurants have special occasions where kids eat free. Some of them do it every week, which can really help you cut costs.

For example, some Pizza Hut locations offer a free buffet for kids under 10, as long as one adult purchases a meal. IHOP, meanwhile, has free kids meals for anyone 12 and under with the purchase of an adult entrée.

Are these the only places where you can find free children’s meals? Of course not, so look around at restaurants near you, and you’ll be surprised at what you’ll find.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. Eat earlier.</h4>
Dinner is often the most expensive time to eat out. Get your restaurant fix out of the way earlier in the day, and you can find early-bird specials at a fraction of the cost.
<h4>4. Don’t buy beverages.</h4>
Water is free at almost any restaurant. If you’re not a water fan, be sure to buy beverages that come with free refills if you’re super thirsty.
<h4>5. Comb the newspaper for coupons.</h4>
Local Sunday newspapers often come packed with copious coupons from restaurants. Many of these offer buy-one-get-one-free deals that can help you skip the cost of an entire meal.

If you’re past the paper age and prefer something more high-tech, try downloading one of these apps to help you save:
<ul>
 	<li>Groupon</li>
 	<li>Restaurant.com</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>6. Avoid the tip.</h4>
No, we’re not suggesting you stiff your waiter when you go out to eat. You can, however, cut 15 percent off your bill by not eating in the restaurant.

Many places now give you the option for curbside pickup. You can still order your favorite food, but instead of dining there, you can pick it up and eat at home.

By avoiding the dining experience, you can prevent the gratuity that comes with it. This alone can be seen as a coupon to help you get that flavorful fix at a discount.
<h4>7. Sign up for apps.</h4>
Does your favorite restaurant have its own app? If it does, downloading it may be worth your time.

You can secure exclusive discounts via apps that may not be advertised to the general public.","Want to keep your monthly costs out of control while still eating out? Then follow these simple tips.","2021-08-31 20:45:11",post,https://housing-relief.com/6-ways-to-save-when-eating-out/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_223908613.jpg,shutterstock_223908613.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_223908613.jpg,5572,"Group,Of,Young,Friends,Enjoying,Meal,In,Outdoor,Restaurant",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_223908613.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,6-ways-to-save-when-eating-out,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-31 20:45:11"
5574,"Why Checking And Fixing Your Credit Is A Must","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Your credit can impact you in more ways than one. Its reach extends far beyond just getting accepted for credit cards or car loans, which is why you not only need to check it, but fix it too.

You can check your credit score by getting your annual report for free. You should do this at least once a year to see your score, check for any errors, and see if someone has stolen your identity.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

As for why fixing your credit is essential, here are several reasons to start doing so as soon as you snag that free report:
<h3>Reasons to Fix Your Credit Now</h3>
<h4>1. You won’t have to pay with cash all the time.</h4>
Some people prefer paying for everything in cash and avoiding debt at all costs. While this isn’t a bad thing, cash can become inconvenient at times.

For example, if you want to rent a car but don’t have a credit card, you may have to pay an extra deposit.

While credit can be convenient and reduce the need for extra deposits in situations like renting a car, what about paying cash for massive purchases?

Many people may not have thousands of dollars in cash lying around. This can keep them from buying a car or home when they need to.

By fixing your credit, however, you can get loans to buy what you need without having to take loads of cash out of your accounts.
<h4>2. You can avoid debt collectors.</h4>
As annoying or scary as debt collectors may be, they’re calling you for a reason. Creditors want to get paid for what they’ve loaned you, so they have a legitimate gripe in sending you letters and calling your phone.

Fix your credit, and you can stop the harassment from collectors.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. You can pay lower interest rates.</h4>
The better your credit score, the less you’ll likely pay in interest. This can save you a ton of money over a lifetime, making credit repair a priority if your score is low.
<h4>4. You can move to a new place.</h4>
Try renting an apartment with bad credit. Most likely, you’ll find it difficult to do if you have delinquencies in the past.

Landlords want to know that potential tenants will pay the rent on time. Bad credit is a red flag that may keep them from approving your application.
<h4>5. You can pay less for insurance.</h4>
Auto and home insurance are a couple of expenses that may take up a big chunk of your budget. You can reduce them by having a better credit history.
<h4>6. You can avoid security deposits.</h4>
Renting a new place isn’t the only case where you’ll be charged a security deposit. If your credit is poor, utility providers and phone companies may ask for a deposit. This means more cash out of your pocket.
<h4>7. You can get more credit.</h4>
Credit can be an excellent way to increase your purchasing power. As long as the interest rates are low, you can use it to get what you need without paying a ton upfront out of pocket.

If you fix your credit and improve your score, you can increase your credit limits to open up more buying opportunities.
<h4>8. You can get a job or promotion.</h4>
Some employers will want to see your credit history before hiring you or giving you a promotion. If it’s bad, it could keep you from being able to pay the bills.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>9. You can become independent.</h4>
Are you tired of having to rely on friends and family to co-sign loans for you? Is the only way to get utilities by putting the account in someone else’s name?

Fix your credit, and you can break from these constraints.
<h4>10. You can gain peace of mind.</h4>
By getting your free credit report, seeing your score, and cleaning up your past, you can sleep better knowing there’s nothing to fear financially anymore.","Have you completely abandoned your credit in terms of checking your score or trying to fix it? Here are the reasons why doing both are essential to your financial future.","2021-09-01 00:55:06",post,https://housing-relief.com/why-checking-and-fixing-your-credit-is-a-must/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1011447724.jpg,shutterstock_1011447724.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1011447724.jpg,5575,"Stressed,Young,Asian,Woman,Trying,To,Find,Money,To,Pay",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1011447724.jpg,Housing,,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,why-checking-and-fixing-your-credit-is-a-must,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-09-01 00:55:06"

The Internet is an excellent tool for learning about Section 8 or the Housing Choice Voucher program. Within seconds, you can get more acquainted with the application process without having to visit an office.

This, unfortunately, comes with a downside that seems to sit at every corner of the Internet: Scammers. And since they target niches where people are in need, you can bet that they have some of their bullseyes on Section 8 searchers.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

To keep you from being the next victim of a Section 8 scam, let’s look at four of the most common schemes that you’re most likely to run into.

For it to make the most chronological sense, we’ll separate these scams according to when you’re most likely to see them throughout the entire process of getting rental assistance.
<h3>Scams When Applying for Section 8</h3>
<h4>1. Pay for applications.</h4>
Section 8 was initiated to help low-income households get the funding they need to live in safe, affordable housing. Keeping this in mind, do you think you should pay to apply for Section 8? Probably not, although there are scams that urge you to pay them so you can apply for your voucher.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) heads the Section 8 program. By law, they prohibit any fees for housing applications.

In short, if you see a request for an application fee, run the other way. Your most likely to see this on an illegitimate site that tells you to “Apply Now.” Once you click on that button, you don’t get to apply. Instead, you get asked to enter payment information.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->
<h4>2. Having your data sold to marketing companies.</h4>
Have you ever noticed that whenever you search online for Section 8 info that you see tons of ads on the subject?

This is not by mistake, as data collection companies pay big bucks for those ads with one purpose in mind: To sell your data.

What happens if you fill out one of their fake Section 8 applications? Your information will be sold to marketing companies so they can hound you with spammy offers. And no, that application will not be official, nor will it help you get a voucher.

If you want to apply for Section 8 rental assistance online, do it via your local Public Housing Agency. Better yet, schedule an interview with them to apply in their office, where you can get additional help should you need it.
<h3>Scams When on the Section 8 Waiting List</h3>
<h4>3. Pay for vouchers.</h4>
Once your Section 8 application is approved, you’ll be put on a waiting list that could take months or years to complete.

If you look online for ways to accelerate the wait, you could be conned into paying for a voucher or moving up in the list, neither of which is possible via payment.

Unless you have unique circumstances, you will have to be patient and wait for your voucher like everyone else.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->
<h3>Scams When Looking for Section 8 Rentals</h3>
<h4>4. Pay to view, reserve, or get more info on a Section 8 rental.</h4>
Once your voucher is on the way or already in place, you’ll want to start looking for Section 8 homes.

A legitimate landlord will gladly let you meet them and view their Section 8 property in person, as well as get any necessary info on it. They won’t ask for money to reserve one, either.

If you see any such requests via online classified sites or anywhere else, do not send any money.","In your quest to get rental assistance from the government with a Section 8 voucher, you could get scammed.

 	<li>Aspire to be a homeowner.</li>
 	<li>Are tired of paying high rent costs without any feeling of ownership.</li>
 	<li>Do not have cash saved up for a down payment.</li>
 	<li>Need to improve your credit score.</li>
 	<li>Are worried about getting approved for a mortgage right now.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Can I handle a higher monthly payment?</h4>
Unlike your standard rent agreement with a landlord, rent-to-own includes a portion that will go towards hopefully purchasing that property in the future. This can lead to a higher monthly payment, so if you’re strapped for cash, you have to consider if paying a bit more is doable.

As an example, you may be used to paying $1,000 in rent per month. If you enter a rent-to-own deal with a landlord, that number could grow to $1,300 monthly. $1,000 will go towards paying the rent, with the excess $300 being part of the rent-to-own agreement. Out of that $300, some will likely go to your landlord as payment for accepting such an arrangement.
<h4>3. Can I handle an upfront fee?</h4>
You’re probably familiar with the concept of paying a security deposit to a landlord before moving into a rental. You may also pay application fees. With rent-to-own contracts, there’s usually an upfront fee called an option fee that, unlike a deposit, is nonrefundable.

Why does this fee exist? To give the landlord an incentive to offer that option to buy once your lease ends. Some say this option fee ranges from 1-7 percent of the purchase price of the property. Luckily, you can negotiate it in most cases.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>4. Can I handle maintenance and repair costs?</h4>
When you rent, you often get peace of mind from not having to worry about any repair or maintenance costs. When you enter a rent-to-own agreement, you may have to factor these costs into your budget.

Since your landlord knows they may be giving the property away when you purchase it once the lease is over, they have less incentive to pay for repairs themselves. In other words, you’ll have to take over this homeowner’s responsibility prematurely.
<h4>5. Can I always pay on time?</h4>
When you miss the rent in a standard rental agreement, you’re usually hit with a late fee. Do it in a rent-to-own agreement, and you could lose any credit you built-up towards purchasing the home.

If you know you have a history of paying the rent late, be careful before jumping into a rent-to-own contract that expects timely payments.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>6. Will the home price fluctuate?</h4>
A home’s value can fluctuate over time. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always move in an upward direction.

When signing the rent-to-own agreement, the current value is what goes into the contract. Should it fall in the future, you will still be expected to pay the originally agreed-upon price.

This potential drop in value could create an issue when trying to get a mortgage for more than what the house is worth.","Can a rent-to-own agreement finally give you that much-awaited title of “homeowner”?

With so many programs at your disposal, becoming a homeowner is now easier than ever. And this is true even if your finances are less than ideal.

Each month you pay your landlord a considerable chunk of your income. And once you hand over that check, you may wonder to yourself, “Will this ever end?”

The only way it will end is by becoming that landlord and owning your home. But this may seem impossible if your income isn’t exactly high and you have other obstacles standing in your way like bad credit and a lack of down payment.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Luckily, it is possible to own a home, even if those issues plague you, thanks to these low-income housing assistance options.
<h4>Get Help With Your Down Payment</h4>
It can be impossible to save towards a down payment if you’re barely getting by each month. Since even affordable homes are expensive relative to other purchases, getting the down payment you need may seem like the biggest obstacle in the house buying process.

How can you overcome this issue? By getting down payment assistance (DPA) through a variety of sources, such as the government, charities, or your employer.

Whether in the form of a loan or a grant, down payment assistance gives an average of $12,000 towards people’s dreams of owning a home. That’s quite an amount of cash, and if you get it as a grant, you won’t have to pay it back.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Why don’t more people use this form of low-income housing assistance? Because they aren’t aware that it’s out there.

As for how to qualify, income is usually taken into account. You could also get DPA by living in an area that’s underserved or in redevelopment.
<h4>Use a Personal Loan</h4>
You could set your sights on an unusually affordable home that’s priced below the market. Why would someone set such a low price on their home? Because they want to sell it quickly.

Homes with low purchase prices can be tricky to get mortgages for. You can opt for a personal loan, however, which can be approved quicker than a mortgage and don’t require appraisals.
<h4>Qualify for a Higher Mortgage</h4>
Several cities, counties, and states issue mortgage credit certificates (MCCs) that can help you get approved for a higher mortgage than you usually would due to your low income.

If you fall within specific income guidelines, you can secure a tax credit that can be added to your qualifying income when applying for a mortgage.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Apply for One of These Low-Income Home Loan Programs</h4>
Whether your credit is less than stellar, your income is low, or you don’t have any money saved for a down payment, here are some loan programs that can help you become a homeowner:
<ul>
 	<li>USDA home loans – Ideal for rural homes. 100 percent financing with no money down.</li>
 	<li>FHA loans – Allow you to get a loan if your credit score is low or you have a high debt-to-income ratio.</li>
 	<li>HomeReady/Home Possible Advantage loans – Small down payments, lower mortgage insurance, and reduced closing costs from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</li>

5589,"Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

<h4>1. What is LIHEAP?</h4>
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program was created by the federal government. The program’s primary goal is to help make heating and cooling costs more affordable for low-income households not only now, but also in the future.

While the federal government started the program, how LIHEAP works and the benefits you can receive vary according to the state you live in. You can find the low-income energy office nearest you by going here.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>2. How does LIHEAP make energy more affordable?</h4>
As mentioned, LIHEAP benefits differ in each state. Overall, the program pledges to offer help in paying your cooling and heating bills to make your current costs low, while also providing home improvements to make energy less expensive later on. Such improvements are referred to as “weatherization” and can make your home more energy-efficient.

LIHEAP can also help in times of energy crisis. For instance, if your utilities are under threat of being shut off, you can fix such a problem with aid from the program.

Although utility bills may include other costs, LIHEAP tends to focus on just the cooling and heating aspects. In other words, your water and sewer bills cannot be covered through this form of energy assistance, unless, for example, some water is tied towards your air conditioning.

It’s worth noting that LIHEAP is not intended to pay all of your energy costs, either. It’s seen more as help towards those costs instead.

For example, if your home’s heat comes from a gas source, you can expect assistance with paying your gas and not your electric bill.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. How does LIHEAP lower future energy costs?</h4>
Getting help with your current cooling and heating costs via LIHEAP is excellent, but it’s the program’s future benefits that may be even better.

Through weatherization, you can enjoy a more energy-efficient home via repairs like:
<ul>
 	<li>Fixing or replacing your air conditioner or furnace (depends on where you live).</li>
 	<li>Installing insulation to keep your cooling and heating costs low.</li>
 	<li>Fixing windows or doors that are improperly sealed.</li>
</ul>
By making such repairs, you’ll be able to keep more cool or hot air inside of your home, which will make each month’s bills lower.
<h4>4. How can you qualify for LIHEAP?</h4>
Unfortunately, LIHEAP benefits aren’t awarded to everyone who applies. The program prioritizes households with high energy costs/needs, and uses income, family size, and other factors to determine who gets help.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

To find out if you qualify for assistance, contact your local LIHEAP office. Please note that simply qualifying doesn’t ensure you will receive benefits, as there is a limited amount of funds set aside for the program each year.

To give you an idea of how much demand exists for this program, only 20 percent of qualified households receive assistance. For this reason, it’s best to contact your office today to be one of the first in line.","What is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and how can it help you with your utility bills?

See what the program can offer, how to qualify for its benefits, and what’s needed to apply.

For many, income goes down as age goes up. Why? We stop working and enter the retired life so we can spend our final years on this earth relaxing and enjoying time with our friends and family.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

While loads of free time as a senior is great, trying to stretch every dollar of a fixed income can get complicated. Cut your housing costs, however, and life becomes much more relaxed.

You could downgrade your current home to achieve this goal, or you could get help from the government to do so. Although Section 8 may be the first government housing program to come to mind, Section 202 may be a better fit, as it focuses on seniors.
<h4>What Section 202 Offers Seniors</h4>
If you want to pay as little as possible for rent, Section 202 can help. If you participate in the program, you will only have to put 30 percent of your income towards the rent. The program will take care of the rest, which gives you tons of flexibility in handling your savings.

Cheap rent may not be the only thing that’s on a senior’s mind, though, as the safety and accessibility of the apartment can be just as important, if not more. Some Section 202 properties address this issue with a host of features, such as ramps to make buildings and apartments wheelchair-accessible, plus grab rails.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Beyond the apartment itself, a senior in the Section 202 program can enjoy additional amenities like daily activities, help with transportation, meals, and bathing, plus on-site care coordinators.
<h4>Section 202 Eligibility Requirements and the Application Process</h4>
If Section 202’s features sound appealing, you’re probably wondering what it takes to get into one of its apartments. Your mileage may vary according to the property you apply for, but here are some standard requirements for the program:

At least one household member must be over 62.
Your household income must fall below 50 percent of the median income for the area where you intend to live.

Some landlords or management companies may require you to receive another form of government assistance to qualify. Again, this can vary according to location.

Although citizenship documentation won’t be checked, Section 202 applications do take into account your housing and criminal history. Specifically, housing history with the HUD will be checked to ensure you don’t have any debts with them. Any evictions from HUD property within the last five years or termination of assistance may disqualify you too.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

As for your criminal history, arrests may not be an issue, but felony convictions for violence or drug-related offenses may lead to disqualification.

Even if you think you may not qualify for Section 202 housing assistance, contact your local housing agency. They can offer more information on the program and help you start the application process. Once you find a property that interests you, the application will be handled directly by the management company or landlord.","Section 202 can put you or a loved one in a safe, senior-friendly apartment at a manageable monthly payment.

Even if you’ve never applied for housing assistance before, you probably have heard that Section 8 can make rent more affordable. While that may be the most popular affordable housing program out there, Section 202 offers similar help for seniors.

Whether you’re a senior seeking a cheaper apartment or are the friend or relative of someone who needs such a service, keep reading. We’ll look at what Section 202 is, how it can help, how to be eligible, and how to apply for this monthly money-saving program.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Section 202 Background</h4>
Formally named the Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program, Section 202 has been around for over six decades. In that time, it has created over 400,000 units explicitly made with seniors in mind.

Unlike standard apartments, Section 202 properties, depending on location, may feature such senior-focused options as grab rails and ramps. Some units are built to adequately accommodate residents in wheelchairs as well.

Making rent more affordable may be Section 202’s primary benefit, but beyond grab rails, ramps, and wheelchair accessibility, some properties also offer amenities such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Daily activities for seniors.</li>
 	<li>Transportation for shopping, medical visits, and more.</li>
 	<li>Care coordinators to help residents with their various needs like meals and bathing.</li>
 	<li>Social spaces for events, eating, and mingling.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Affordable Rent Through Section 202</h4>
It’s hard to get past those attractive amenities for seniors, but, once again, Section 202’s most significant benefit is its financial assistance. For seniors who qualify and are accepted into the program, they can live in an apartment by only paying 30 percent of their income towards rent. This is crucial for anyone on a fixed income who is no longer working.

What does it take to get such significant rental assistance through Section 202? First, there must be at least one senior citizen living in the home. For the program’s purpose, this means one person must be 62 years of age or older.

Second, an income requirement must be met. To qualify, your income cannot exceed half of the area’s median income where you are hoping to live. To get an idea of the median income limits, <a href=""https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2019_query"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">go here</a>.

Beyond those two main requirements, your eligibility may be negatively affected if you’ve been terminated from housing assistance or still owe money to a housing authority. The same holds if you’ve been evicted within the last five years from HUD housing.

Some landlords or management companies may still accept you if you have a criminal history that includes drug or violent offenses. Such convictions can make it harder to qualify, however.

As a side note, you may be required to already receive government assistance from other programs to qualify for Section 202. This will depend on your location.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Apply for Section 202 Now</h4>
The demand for senior housing assistance is quite high. Even if you meet all the requirements, you could be placed on a lengthy waiting list.

To avoid a long wait, apply for Section 202 now by contacting your nearest Public Housing Agency. If you know of a specific Section 202 property, you can also apply by contacting its management company or landlord.","Getting help with the rent can make any senior’s fixed budget much more manageable.

A laptop used to be a luxury. Now, with school and work being moved online, it’s a necessity.

What’s the problem with a laptop? Its cost, as not everyone can afford the few hundred dollars or more it takes to purchase a laptop. Luckily, there are ways to get around this obstacle, as certain organizations like the ones below offer free laptops to those who qualify.

What does qualifying for a free laptop usually require? That you make below a certain income level. But since every situation and organization is different, be sure to contact each to see if you can make the cut.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Computers With Causes</h4>
While some people sell their old computers, others donate them. An organization like Computers With Causes then takes those donated devices and gives them out to those with the most needs.

If you need a laptop for an underprivileged child, a household in need, or a returning military member, give Computers With Causes a look, as those are the three groups they serve most.

To qualify, you will need to fill out an application. And before you fill it out, know that receiving a free laptop could impact any government benefits you receive. To play it safe, contact the government assistance program you belong to and ask if getting a free laptop will affect your eligibility.
<h4>The On It Foundation</h4>
Here’s another organization that takes donated computers and distributes them to others. To qualify, you’ll need a child attending grades K-12 in your household. Not only that, but they will also have to qualify for free or reduced school lunches. As such, your child will have to attend public school for you to be eligible.

Don’t get this confused with Computers With Causes, as they are separate organizations. With Causes offers free laptops to low-income families, members or veterans of the military, and anyone living in a shelter for battered women.

As with all of the free laptop resources in this list, you will have to apply to see if you qualify.
And once again, before receiving that free laptop, check with government assistance programs you receive to ensure you will not lose any benefits.
<h4>Have Your Child Attend Online Public School</h4>
Many schools have moved online since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. And while they’re opening back up, you may have the option to continue online schooling for your child.

Many people barely watch cable anymore due to its high costs and the draw of streaming services like Netflix. Unfortunately, as Netflix has become more popular and aims to expand its library of shows and movies, it has decided to increase its prices.

How can you overcome Netflix’s price hikes? By following these tips to either get it for free or for cheap.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Ask For Someone Else’s Login Credentials</h4>
Netflix has different membership tiers. Its standard tier allows for two screens simultaneously, while the premium tier allows for four. Why is this important? Because if you have friends or family members with a Netflix account, you can ask for their login credentials to watch for free.

This is a popular money-saving move amongst college students and families. So if you haven’t tried it yet, give it a go.

You may hear a no, a yes, or they may ask you to chip in for the costs. If it’s the latter, you can still enjoy a ton of entertainment for a price that’s lower than a single movie ticket.
<h4>Get Free Netflix From Your Cell Phone or Internet Provider</h4>
Competition for cell phone and Internet customers is at an all-time high. Since companies know that Netflix is so popular, some are adding it to their plans as an incentive to sign up.

For example, T-Mobile has a “Netflix on Us” program that offers the service for free with specific plans. Some Internet providers, meanwhile, will offer something similar to lure you in as a new customer.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Get Free Netflix DVDs</h4>
Netflix may be most well-known for its streaming service nowadays. But it started with DVD rentals. Those rentals still exist, and you can get a one-month free trial that gives you unlimited rentals for 30 days. Even better, there are no late fees, and shipping is free.

To take advantage of this offer, you’ll need to provide your payment information. As long as you cancel the trial before the month ends, you won’t be charged.

While this used to work with the streaming service, Netflix stopped offering free trials for that department a little while ago.
<h4>Find Netflix Promo Codes</h4>
This tip may not get you free Netflix, but a promo code can cut the cost to make it better fit your budget.

The Internet has promo codes that work as digital coupons for nearly everything under the sun, including Netflix. You can find them by typing “Netflix promo codes” in a search engine. Another method is to go to sites like Slickdeals.net, Coupons.com, and RetailMeNot.com to see if they have any Netflix coupons. The benefit of taking that route is that such sites usually tell you whether or not the coupons still work.

<h4>Buy Discounted Gift Cards</h4>
What do people do with unused gift cards? They sell them on the Internet via sites like Raise.com. Buy a discounted gift card, and you can get it on the cheap. Then, you can use that gift card to pay for Netflix.

It won’t be free, but you will snag some savings. And you can use this hack to buy other things online as well.","Netflix can keep you and your family entertained when stuck inside.

5613,"How To Get Free Hulu","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

When you think of streaming services, what pops into your head first? It’s probably Netflix, which you may already have a subscription to. There are many other services, though, and they’re worth a shot if you’re looking to change things up and enjoy new movies and shows.

Hulu is one such service. And while popular, it’s not quite at Netflix’s level. This may be holding you back from giving Hulu a try, so do the following so you can sample it for free or take a huge chunk out of its monthly cost.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Get the Free Trial</h4>
Hulu is still in its growth stage, which is why it offers a free trial to new customers. Signing up for the trial is the easiest and most common way to get Hulu at no cost, but who knows how long it will last. Why? Because Netflix used to offer the same until it got extremely popular. Now, however, you cannot get a free streaming Netflix trial.

When signing up for a free Hulu trial, you’ll need to provide payment information. As long as you cancel the trial before your one month is up, you won’t be charged, so don’t fret about entering your payment details.
<h4>Share an Account</h4>
If you don’t want to go through a bunch of hacks and hassles to get free or cheap Hulu, sharing an account with someone you know is your best bet.

If money is tight, ask a friend or family member if they can share their Hulu login credentials. If they decline, say you’re willing to split the cost.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

When choosing this option, it’s best to avoid the cheapest Hulu plan. Since it limits streaming to one screen at a time, you could have viewing conflicts when sharing a login on a cheaper plan.
<h4>Use a Coupon</h4>
Digital coupons found online can cut the cost of Hulu or almost any other streaming service. A simple search for “Hulu coupons” should help you find what you’re looking for, or you can use sites like Coupons.com, RetailMeNot.com, Slickdeals.net, and so on.
<h4>Get a Hulu Gift Card</h4>
Have you seen Hulu gift cards when shopping at Target, Best Buy, etc.? That’s because many people buy them as gifts. You can get free Hulu by asking for such a gift card from friends and family if you have a birthday coming up.
<h4>Bundle With Disney+</h4>
This option isn’t free, but it will give you a ton of bang for your buck when it comes to streaming entertainment. For $12.99 per month, you can get Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. With those three services in your home, you won’t have to worry about ever getting bored.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Switch to Sprint</h4>
Cell phone and Internet companies have so much competition that they’ve started to bundle streaming services with their plans. Sprint Unlimited is one example that will give you free Hulu when you sign up for their cell phone service.","Have you been thinking of giving Hulu a try, but you’re unsure if you want to pay for this streaming service?

Could you use some extra income? Most of us probably could. And while that may send you on a job search, there are easier methods to getting that additional income that involve your car. Here are some of the best of the bunch:
<h4>Rent Your Vehicle Via Turo.com or Getaround.com</h4>
The pandemic kept people stuck inside for almost a year. As things start to open up, people are hitting the road in record numbers.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

While some people take their own cars on road trips, others prefer rentals. But since 60 percent more people are traveling, the supply of rental cars is running out, which is where you can come in.

Turo.com and Getaround.com are two sites where you can list your car as a rental. With daily rates ranging from $50 to $100, this is a great way to make extra cash with very little work. And since you set the schedule, you won’t have to worry about going carless when trying this money-making method.
<h4>Sell Your Vehicle</h4>
Do any of these apply to your situation?
<ul>
 	<li>You have a second vehicle that you barely use.</li>
 	<li>You’ve wanted to sell your car for some time.</li>
 	<li>You need cash so bad that your car is no longer a necessity.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

If so, then selling your car right now could be a smart move since dealers are offering double the usual for trade-ins, and private buyers are paying 30 percent more for vehicles.

Selling your car personally can be done via sites like AutoTrader.com and CarGurus.com. Or you can call up the nearest dealer and give them your info. Let them know you’ll sell to the highest bidder, and see what they come back with. While you’re at it, give Carvana and CarMax a try to see who gives you the best offer.
<h4>Wrap Your Vehicle</h4>
Do you want an easy way to pay off your car note? Wrap your car with ads and then drive around as you usually do.

Sites like Carvertise.com and Wrapify.com are willing to pay people up to $450 per month to wrap their cars and drive around town. The more of your car is wrapped, and the more you drive, the higher your earnings.
<h4>Use Your Vehicle to Make Deliveries</h4>
The days of delivering pizza to make a measly income are now over, as you can use your car to deliver almost anything under the sun for excellent wages.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

If you don’t mind having people in your car, Uber or Lyft are well-known income-earning avenues. DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Instacart may be up your alley if you don't mind picking up food or groceries. And if you wouldn’t mind working for Amazon, the company’s Flex service is paying delivery drivers up to $19 per hour.

Are those your only ways to make money via deliveries? No, as you can also create a profile on TaskRabbit.com offering help moving items or as a courier. The benefit of taking this route is that you get to set your wages and have complete control over your work.","When you need extra money, your car may be your best friend.

5619,"5 Ways To Replace Cable","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Do you cringe every time you look at your cable bill? You probably do, as those bills can easily top $100. Worst of all, the fact that you may not watch most of the channels in your lineup may lead you to feel like you’re getting ripped off.

That’s the bad news. Here’s the good: Cutting the cord isn’t as hard as you think. And thanks to all of the entertainment options out there, you can get rid of your cable bill while still having plenty of content at your fingertips.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Here are moves you can make right not to replace your overpriced cable service:
<h4>1. Put an antenna on your TV.</h4>
Out of all the moves you can make to cut the cord, this one may be the easiest and most effective. Believe it or not, a $15 HD antenna can pick up tons of free channels in high definition. Sure, you’ll have that initial cost of buying the antenna, but after that, you won’t have to pay a thing to enjoy local channels, news, and networks like PBS, CBS, ABC, NBC, and FOX.

As for the installation, it’s as simple as screwing the antenna into the back of your TV and scanning for channels.
<h4>2. Try your luck with websites.</h4>
Every major network has its own website. And beyond advertising what they have to offer, those networks tend to offer entire episodes of their content that you can stream.

Will every network offer free streaming? No, but many do, so start visiting sites of your favorites to see if you have any luck.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. Make your TV a smart one.</h4>
Many televisions on the market are Smart TVs that let you stream content. If you have an older TV, you can convert it into a “smarter” one by buying a device like Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick, or Chromecast. Also, if your kids have gaming consoles, you can use them to stream content.

As for which streaming services you can enjoy, the list is long. Here are the most popular free streaming services that are loaded with TV shows, news, and movies:
<ul>
 	<li>Crackle</li>
 	<li>Vudu</li>
 	<li>Tubi</li>
 	<li>Pluto TV</li>
 	<li>The Roku Channel</li>
</ul>
Here are the paid services you can stream through your TV that will require some cash out of your pocket, but should still end up cheaper than your cable bill:
<ul>
 	<li>Amazon Prime Video</li>
 	<li>Hulu</li>
 	<li>Netflix</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. Use your library as a free Blockbuster.</h4>
Do you remember Blockbuster Video? The chain allowed you to rent movies for a price. And while Blockbuster is gone, your local library can be used for the same purpose.

If you haven’t visited your nearest library in a while, do so, as you may be able to rent DVDs of popular movies and TV shows. Even better, many libraries now have free streaming services that you can use to enjoy movies and shows as well.
<h4>5. Pay for a cable replacement.</h4>
If you still want to enjoy some semblance of an actual cable lineup, try Hulu with Live TV or Sling TV. Both can give you full lineups for around $40 to $50 per month. Or, you can combine your HD antenna for free local networks with a paid service like Netflix, Prime Video, or Hulu, alternating them each month to keep your costs low.","Do you feel left out as everyone seems to be cutting the cord?

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered record job loss, and many people are still unemployed. While extra unemployment benefits from the American Rescue Plan helped, they could be ending soon, which is why you’ll need to make plans to stay afloat if you’re out of a job.

Here are some moves you can make to offset the loss of unemployment benefits.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Contact Your State’s Unemployment Office</h4>
While help from the federal government may dwindle, you could still be eligible for unemployment benefits from your state. By contacting your state’s unemployment office now and seeing what it takes to continue receiving benefits, you can at least count on some income until you find a new job.
<h4>Make a Budget</h4>
Cutting spending is a great way to stretch every dollar in your budget. Until you get working again, you’ll probably need to cut back on some luxuries and focus on the necessities. Try eating out less and cut your entertainment costs.

Focus on the essentials like housing, food, utilities, and health care when making your budget.
Don’t forget about credit card bills and similar expenses either.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Start Some Side Hustles</h4>
A side hustle can get you quick cash to at least put food on the table and pay a few bills. Luckily, side hustles are now everywhere, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble supplementing your income. Here are some examples of side hustles you can do:
<ul>
 	<li>Babysitting and pet sitting – A site like Care.com can offer gigs in this department.</li>
 	<li>Drive for a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft.</li>
 	<li>Deliver food through an app like Instacart, Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Shipt.</li>
 	<li>Set up a profile on TaskRabbit.com doing odd jobs like cleaning, painting, or running errands.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Look For a Bridge Job</h4>
If you need cash now since your unemployment benefits are running out, you may need to settle for a bridge job. What is it? A job that isn’t in your ideal industry or doesn’t pay the perfect salary, but allows you to survive.

While a bridge job may not be your cup of tea, a silver lining is that it may pay more since demand is so high. Many restaurants are now hiring at higher wages than usual, which can help boost your bottom line.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Find Housing and Food Assistance</h4>
A whopping $47 billion has been allocated by Congress to help renters in need. Who has it? 340 agencies, which can make getting rental assistance quite complicated.

To get the assistance you need without running around in circles, call 211. Tell them you need help with the rent, and they should be able to point you in the right direction.

While on the phone with a 211 operator, ask about food assistance and any other help you may need. They can connect you with food pantries in your area, or even organizations to help you pay bills. And to get longer-term food assistance, apply for SNAP (food stamps).","Are you worried about what you’ll do if or when extra unemployment benefits end?

5630,"How To Get Help Paying Your Medical Bills","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Follow these tips, and you could eliminate your medical debt without paying a penny out of pocket.

When you receive a hefty medical bill in the mail, it’s easy to feel frustrated. You may even feel scared. However, one thing you should not feel is alone, as there are 72 million people in the same boat who are drowning in medical debt.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

While that statistic may not offer much relief, this can: Knowing that there are organizations and methods out there that can put a significant dent in your medical debt or pay it altogether.
Here they are:
<h4>Start a GoFundMe</h4>
Before you roll your eyes or say to yourself, “There’s no way I will do that,” know that GoFundMe is one of the best ways to raise a ton of cash in very little time. By writing your story in detail and telling others why you need help with medical bills, there’s a good chance you’ll find the assistance you need from friends and family, plus the general public.
<h4>Call the Healthcare Provider That’s Billing You</h4>
What’s the worst thing you can do with medical bills? Ignore them, as they certainly won’t disappear on their own. On the other hand, the best thing you can do is be proactive and attack the issue head-on, which is why calling the healthcare provider in question is a must early on in the process.

Sure, you may feel overwhelmed at how much your medical bills are, but by calling the hospital or doctor behind the bill, you can lower the amount with minimal effort.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Before making the call, prepare your story. You want to describe why you cannot pay the bill due to low income, the inability to work, kids to take care of, etc. In doing so, you let the provider know your situation so they can make their move.

In some cases, healthcare providers can drop bills entirely and eliminate your debt in one swoop. In other cases, they can lower the bills to make them easier to pay, or put you on a payment plan with no interest that won’t significantly impact your monthly budget.
<h4>Look for Organizations That Deal With Your Specific Illness</h4>
What do these organizations have in common?
<ul>
 	<li>The CancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation</li>
 	<li>The Patient Access Network Foundation (PAN)</li>
 	<li>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</li>
 	<li>The HealthWell Foundation</li>
</ul>
They’re all examples of organizations that offer medical bill assistance for specific illnesses. In the case of the PAN, they handle 70 illnesses, so contact them and see if they can help. If not, keep trying and searching online for organizations tied to your situation.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Get in Touch With a Medical Billing Advocate</h4>
You may be able to get a medical billing advocate for free through the Patient Advocate Foundation or your employer. They’ll take a look at your medical bills to search for errors or negotiate a lower amount. If you can’t get one for free, their fee may be worth it, as they can greatly reduce medical bills through their expertise.
<h4>See if Your Local Church Can Help</h4>
Churches can step in and set up fundraisers through the community to help people with mounting medical bills that they cannot pay.","Are you wondering how you’ll pay costly medical bills when you were barely staying afloat before?

Why do so many people go into deep debt and ruin their credit in the process, making their financial future less than ideal? Besides buying expensive things that don’t fit their budget, it’s not having enough cash to match their monthly bills.

If your bills are getting out of hand and you need quick cash to come to the rescue, avoid personal loans or using your credit card until you’ve tried this: Selling stuff you no longer use or don’t need. Doing it is a lot easier than you think, and since you have both online and local options, you should have plenty of buyers.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

If you’ve never sold your used stuff before, you may be wondering where to start. Here are some pointers to give you some direction.
<h4>How To Sell Your Stuff on the Internet</h4>
You don’t have to be tech-savvy to start selling your items online for additional income. As long as you have a smartphone to snap some pics, you can start making sales today.

Speaking of pics, take as many as possible that show different angles of your product. The idea is to show its condition, so potential buyers know exactly what they’re getting. Make it a point also to write solid, detailed descriptions of each product. Comment on its condition and add any words you think could convince people to make the purchase.

When making your listings, imagine that you’re browsing the site. Would you pull the trigger on that listing? Is something missing? If so, beef up the listing to increase your chances of getting a sale.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

As for where to sell your stuff on the Internet, here are some of the most popular options:
<ul>
 	<li>Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist – Great for quick sales and local pickups.</li>
 	<li>eBay – Offers tons of traffic, if you don’t mind shipping to the buyers.</li>
 	<li>Decluttr – Use this if you want a single payment for all of your stuff without having to list it separately.</li>
</ul>

 	<li>Make sure your neighborhood allows for yard or garage sales. Some do not.</li>
 	<li>Set your garage sales for the weekend when people are out and about and have time to browse your items. Three-day weekends are even better.</li>
 	<li>Price your items according to the market. You can figure this out by seeing similar items for sale through local sellers on Craigslist.</li>
 	<li>To maximize your earnings, price items at 10-15 percent higher than the lowest price you’re willing to accept. This leaves room for hagglers.</li>
 	<li>Get traffic to your sale via street signs on several corners near your home. You can also put ads on Craigslist or in your local newspaper.</li>
 	<li>If you plan on having several yard sales, you may want to consider a point-of-sale system like Square that accepts credit cards. It could lead to easier sales and increase your bottom line.</li>

5637,"Should You Buy A HUD Home On The Cheap?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Some people feel like they’ll be renters forever and paying off their landlords’ mortgages instead of their own. Why? Because most homes may seem out of their reach due to high prices, but some houses could be considered steals.

They’re called HUD homes, and we’ll discuss whether or not they could be the right fit for your dreams of becoming a homeowner.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>What Is the HUD?</h4>
“HUD” stands for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Started in 1965, this agency was put into place to fight poverty and give low-income people in urban areas the ability to find safe and affordable housing.

One way in which the HUD makes housing affordable is through its Section 8 program that pays a portion of the rent directly to the landlord. Another is through FHA loans that are easier to acquire than other mortgages thanks to their less stringent requirements on credit score, down payment, and closing costs.
<h4>What Is a HUD Home?</h4>
If a borrower cannot pay their FHA loan and default on it, that home becomes a foreclosed property. The FHA pays off the remaining balance of the mortgage and takes ownership of the property.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Once that happens, the property officially becomes a HUD home, and the agency will put it up for sale at a price that’s usually below market value. This affordable selling price is used to sell the home quickly so the HUD can recoup its costs due to the loan's borrower defaulting.
<h4>How To Buy a HUD Home</h4>
One issue many people have with buying a home is how investors seem to sneak up in line and secure properties. With HUD homes, people looking to use the house as a primary residence are first in line. You will not be able to buy a HUD home if you bought one in the last two years. And if you do buy one, you will have to live in it for at least one year.

As mentioned, the HUD wants to move these houses as quickly as possible. Besides listing them at prices below market value, the agency sometimes uses programs to entice buyers to bite.

For example, the HUD may offer vouchers for homeownership that pay a portion of the mortgage or housing expenses. Through their One Dollar Program, families with low or moderate income may be able to buy a house that’s been on the market for six-plus months for just a dollar.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

To make down payments more affordable, the Hud $100 Down Program may let you buy a house with a down payment of just $100 instead of 3.5 percent of the purchase price. If you’re a public servant like a police officer or teacher, you could use the Good Neighbor Next Door Program to get 50 percent off a home. Lastly, the HUD’s Non-Profit Program lets community organizations buy homes at a 30 percent discount. They can then revitalize the homes and sell them to low-income families.

As for whether or not a HUD home is right for you, it could be if you’re looking for an affordable property where you’re first in line over investors. And if you want a low down payment, cheaper closing costs, and a loan that’s easier to obtain, it may be your best bet.

What’s the downside to a HUD home? Restrictions on selling it, as you’ll need to live in it for a year. You’ll also need to use a HUD-approved real estate agent in the buying process, and you’ll be buying the home “as-is,” so there may be some renovation work necessary.","If the rising cost of real estate has you wondering if you’ll ever be able to afford a house, a HUD home may be right up your alley.","2021-09-15 15:18:41",post,https://housing-relief.com/should-you-buy-a-hud-home-on-the-cheap/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_451242040.jpg,shutterstock_451242040.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_451242040.jpg,5638,"Realtor,Showing,Young,Couple,Around,Property,For,Sale",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_451242040.jpg,"More Savings",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,should-you-buy-a-hud-home-on-the-cheap,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-09-15 15:18:41"

<h4>Change the Way You Look at Dinner</h4>
For some reason, society has taught us that dinner has to be formal and expensive every night of the week. That simply isn’t true, especially if you’re on a budget, which is why you should change how you look at dinner to start saving.

Here are some ways to achieve this goal:
<ul>
 	<li>Make breakfast for dinner, as your morning meals are usually a lot more economical.</li>
 	<li>Eat appetizers for dinner.</li>
 	<li>Aim for three-ingredient recipes that cost less and are easier to make.</li>
 	<li>Look for meatless meals that cut your per-dinner costs by eliminating pricy meats.</li>
 	<li>Use your leftovers to create new meals.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

When you start implementing those tips at dinner, you should see a significant increase in your bottom line. Not only will they save you money, but they’ll save you time and stress as well.
<h4>Plan Your Meals</h4>
It’s a lot easier to stick to a limited budget when you plan your meals. Doing so keeps you from straying from a list and making expensive impulse purchases. It also saves you from eating out because you don’t know what to make.

If meal planning seems too time-consuming, invest in a plan. What the plan costs upfront will be more than worth it with the time and money you save in the long run.
<h4>Clean Out Your Pantry</h4>
When we say, “Clean out your pantry,” we don’t mean you should toss things out and buy new ones. Instead, we’re suggesting you use whatever you have in your kitchen and don’t shop until it’s gone.

If you need tips on how to do this, look up the “pantry challenge” that works wonders at cleaning out your kitchen and saving money.
<h4>Never Enter the Store Without a List</h4>
As simple as it sounds, shopping with a list will save you tons of money as long as you stick to this rule: If it’s not on the list, don’t buy it.
<h4>Never Shop When You’re Hungry</h4>
Your impulse purchases will skyrocket if you shop when you’re starving, so eat something beforehand.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Compare Grocery Prices</h4>
If you want to see who has the lowest prices, use an app like Instacart to compare them.
<h4>Enroll in Loyalty Programs</h4>
Many large grocery store chains have loyalty programs with incentives to keep you coming back. Sign up for these programs to get instant savings at checkout.
<h4>Use This Simple Method to Save</h4>
An excellent strategy to use when grocery shopping is to:
<ol>
 	<li>Shop for your staples first (eggs, meat, veggies, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Shop for sales items next.</li>
</ol>
When shopping for sales items, only pick up things that mesh with your meal plan.
<h4>Avoid the Middle Aisles</h4>
Speaking of staples, you can find necessities and the healthiest foods on the perimeter of the store. What’s found in the middle aisles? Processed comfort foods that are pricey and not so ideal for your health.
<h4>If It’s at Eye Level, Skip It</h4>
Grocery stores tend to stock the most expensive items at eye level. Look up and down for better deals.
<h4>Pick Generic Over Brand Names</h4>
You may be skeptical of this tip due to quality. To give it a try, buy one generic item on your next trip and compare it to the brand name. Once you see there’s little difference, you can keep going generic to save money.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Go Frozen Over Fresh</h4>
Frozen foods like fruits and veggies last longer and tend to be cheaper.
<h4>Shop Without Your Kids</h4>
If you can get someone to take care of your kids while you shop, do it. Kids can fill your cart with unnecessary and expensive items.","You could cut coupons to save cash on food.

5643,"11 Ways To Slash Your Electric Bill In Half","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

What’s your biggest monthly expense? It’s probably your rent or mortgage. What comes after that? If you’re like many, it could be your utility bill.

While you can’t get rid of your utility bill completely, you can surely reduce it to make the expense more manageable. Here are some tips that can help you reach that goal. Do enough of them, and you could slash your electric bill in half.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>1. Get a free energy audit.</h4>
Before you start implementing ways to reduce your electricity usage, it’s a good idea to figure out exactly where you stand. An energy audit can do this, and some utility companies offer this service at no cost.

Contact your electricity provider to see if they can perform a free audit. If they can’t, you can do it on your own with a little online research.
<h4>2. Install LED lighting.</h4>
Would you like to reduce your lighting costs by as much as 90 percent? LED lighting can do so, making it a smart investment.
<h4>3. Eliminate phantom energy.</h4>
Even though your electronic devices may be “off,” they could still be using energy if they’re plugged in. This “phantom energy” can account for 75 percent of your usage, so it makes sense to unplug devices when they’re not in use.

If unplugging each device seems like a hassle, invest in some inexpensive power strips. You can use them to turn off multiple devices at once when you leave the room.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>4. Clean your refrigerator.</h4>
Try to clean your refrigerator coils every three months. It will not only extend the life of your fridge, so you don’t have to buy a new one, but it’ll also make it more energy-efficient.
<h4>5. Fill your refrigerator.</h4>
Besides always having food handy, here’s another reason to keep your fridge well-stocked: It can reduce electricity usage.

The more stuff you have in your fridge, the more insulated it’ll be. This makes it easier for it to stay cool.
<h4>6. Turn your stove off sooner.</h4>
When your food is almost done cooking on the stovetop, turn it off. The built-up heat can continue to cook your food without using extra electricity.
<h4>7. When using the dishwasher, turn off heat dry.</h4>
It takes a lot of energy to heat water when drying your dishes in the dishwasher. Dry them by hand and let the washer do all of the “dirty work,” and you’ll save electricity.
<h4>8. Use fans more.</h4>
What’s one of the biggest energy consumers in any home? The air conditioner. Install affordable ceiling fans that use less energy, and you can keep your cooling costs down.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>9. Install tinted window film.</h4>
Sunlight that enters your windows can heat your home and increase your cooling costs. With tinted window film, you can keep the sunlight out to keep those cooling costs from getting out of hand.

If you don’t want to install window film, keep your blinds closed.
<h4>10. Dry your laundry manually.</h4>
Do you live in an area with plenty of sunlight? If so, put it to use by line drying your laundry. It costs almost nothing to tie a line to put your clothes on, and it eliminates the need for your dryer, which’s a known electricity hog.
<h4>11. See if you qualify for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</h4>
With LIHEAP, you can get help paying your electric bill with funding from the government.","Are you tired of seeing your electric bill go up?

5646,"Hotel Vouchers For The Homeless: The Pros And Cons","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Homelessness is a situation where you don’t want to be for long. Unfortunately, you’ll need to endure it until you can start making money so you can get back into a home or apartment of your own. Where will you stay in the meantime?

If you cannot live with friends or family, the most likely options are a homeless shelter or living on the streets. You do have one more option, though, and that’s to get a hotel/motel voucher.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Homeless Hotel Vouchers Explained</h4>
It may seem hard to believe, but there are cases where you can actually stay in a hotel or motel for free. You can do so with a voucher that takes the place of cash from your own pocket, and it’s a form of housing assistance that’s desirable to many homeless people. Let’s explain why.
<h4>The Advantages of Homeless Hotel Vouchers</h4>
Living in a hotel is much more ideal than a homeless shelter for several reasons. You can enjoy your private room, which comes with peace of mind and quiet that you may need to manage your stress levels right now. You can also expect a more sanitary setting in a hotel or motel versus homeless shelters, as they’re known to have issues with cleanliness.

Safety is another significant advantage of using a hotel voucher instead of a homeless shelter. Many shelters have problems with violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and theft. Such are issues that you may not want to expose your family to.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>The Disadvantages of Homeless Hotel Vouchers</h4>
The main problem with hotel/motel vouchers is that they can be hard to find. The demand is high, and the supply is usually low, so finding a voucher could be like pinpointing a needle in a haystack.

Even if you do get your hands on a hotel voucher, you probably won’t get to enjoy it for long. Most motel vouchers have maximum stays of three nights, making these very temporary solutions for homeless housing.
<h4>How to Find Hotel Vouchers if You’re Homeless</h4>
Despite their disadvantages, hotel vouchers can be the perfect solution if you find yourself on the verge of living on the streets and just need a few days to collect yourself.
Here are the best places to find them:
<h5>211</h5>
Calling 211 is a must if you’re homeless and don’t know what to do. A local operator can connect you with any hotel vouchers in your area. If not, they can at least direct you to a homeless shelter, plus provide other forms of assistance regarding food, healthcare, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h5>Salvation Army and Catholic Charities</h5>
Both of these organizations have helped the homeless over the years, and they can help you too.
<h5>Homeless Assistance Programs</h5>
There may be homeless assistance programs in your area that offer hotel vouchers. To find one, search the Internet for homeless assistance plus your location.
<h5>Homeless Shelters</h5>
Your local homeless shelter may have information on where to find hotel/motel vouchers.","Are hotel vouchers worth your time?

5649,"How To Rent An Apartment If You Have No Credit","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Follow the tips in this quick guide, and you could overcome that obstacle despite your credit history.

Renting an apartment can be difficult for anyone. But if you have no credit history, snagging that apartment may seem impossible. While landlords may not be too keen on renting to someone without a credit history, there are ways to get around this problem. Here they are:

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>1. Look for individual landlords instead of large companies.</h4>
If you’ve ever tried to rent an apartment from a large complex or a property manager, you probably know that there are a lot of hoops to jump through. Such communities will have several requirements for prospective tenants, with credit checks being one of them. And even if you’re honest about your lack of credit history, a property manager or large rental company probably won’t be flexible with their rules.

An individual landlord, on the other hand, may not be so strict. They may look at tenants on a case-to-case basis. Explain your issues to such a landlord, and they could let you rent if you make a certain income, offer to pay more upfront, etc., especially if they need to find a tenant soon.
<h4>2. Pay more upfront.</h4>
Why do many landlords require credit checks? To reduce their risk and get peace of mind knowing that the tenant will pay on time. However, if you have no credit history, you’ll have to offer that peace of mind another way, such as paying more upfront.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Tell the landlord that you’ll pay them a few months’ rent before moving in. Or say you can leave a larger security deposit. This could be your key to getting accepted.
<h4>3. Ask for a month-to-month lease.</h4>
With a month-to-month lease, you can prove your worth to a landlord and show that you’re a tenant who can pay the rent on time. After a few months of timely payments, you can then switch to a long-term contract.
<h4>4. Prove your income.</h4>
A landlord usually looks for tenants who make 2.5 times the monthly rent. Such income means the tenant can probably afford the rent without any issues. With no credit history, do all you can to prove you make enough income. Provide the landlord with as much payment verification as possible, including copies of bank statements, W2 forms, pay stubs, etc.
<h4>5. Move in quickly.</h4>
A landlord in need of quick cash may accept you with no credit history if you can move in quickly. For instance, if there are 10 days left in the month and the apartment is empty, the landlord may take you in so they can gain that extra income versus waiting until the first of the month.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>6. Co-sign with someone.</h4>
Perhaps the easiest way to rent a place with no credit history is to get a co-signer. Whether it’s a parent, friend, or relative, the co-signer will be responsible for the rent. If you leave or fail to pay, the co-signer will be on the hook financially. So, while this is an easy option for you, there may be issues with finding someone willing to sign their name to the lease.

A similar option to getting a co-signer is to get a roommate with a solid credit history. As with the co-signer, they will be responsible if you fail to pay.
<h4>7. Write a personal letter with references.</h4>
Adding a personal letter to your rent application could help you stand out from the pack. It could also help explain why you don’t have credit, so the landlord understands your situation. Be sure to include references with your letter to bolster its credibility.","Are you worried you won’t be able to rent an apartment because you have no credit?

5652,"Should You Ask Your Landlord For Cheaper Rent?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Are you happy with where you’re living, but unhappy with how much you’re paying? An easy fix for this problem would be to negotiate a lower rent payment with your landlord.

If you’ve never thought of this, you’re not alone, as many people avoid asking for rent reductions because they feel their landlords will never say yes. But even if they say no, you have nothing to lose, other than a little bit of your time.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

You can keep living where you are and enjoy cheaper rent. Here are some tips that can make it happen.
<h4>1. Do your research before asking.</h4>
The rebate you request will play a huge role in determining whether your landlord accepts your offer. That’s why it’s best to do your research beforehand so you can pick the correct dollar amount.

You can do this by searching rental properties near you online. Or you could simply ask neighbors what they’re paying.
<h4>2. Know when to ask.</h4>
The best time to ask for a rent reduction is when you are renewing your lease. It gives you more leverage, especially if you’ve been a good tenant who’s always paid on time and has kept the property in tip-top shape. Since your landlord will likely want to keep you as a tenant, they may be willing to accept a rent reduction to do so.

Of course, you may not have the luxury of waiting until your lease renews if you’ve been hit with financial hardship. If that’s the case, ask for the rent reduction as soon as possible. It will show that you’re planning ahead and are concerned about your status as a tenant, which will make you look responsible in the landlord’s eyes.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. Try asking for a temporary rent reduction.</h4>
If you have little leverage in asking for cheaper rent, request a temporary reduction. This may work if you’re paying rent in line with the market, but lost your job or income.

Let the landlord know that you’re doing everything possible to fix your finances, and cheaper rent will only be for a few months until you get back on your feet. They may easily accept such an offer.
<h4>4. List your reasons for requesting a rent reduction.</h4>
Asking for cheaper rent simply because you “feel like it” won’t make a compelling argument.
Listing reasons why the rent should be lower, however, can help your case. Financial trouble is one of the top reasons for requesting lower rent and at least a temporary reduction.

Competing properties where rent is cheaper can help as well. Don’t forget amenities, though. If your property lacks a gym, laundry, or other amenities that nearby properties offer, mention this to your landlord. They may lower the rent in response or offer those amenities, which is also a win.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>5. Write a rent reduction letter.</h4>
While talking to your landlord face-to-face is fine, writing a rent reduction letter is more professional and could help you land the result you desire. You can find rent reduction letter templates online.

Fill in your information and include all of the reasons why your rent should be lower. Then mail or email it to the landlord.","As you look for wiggle room in your monthly budget, you may be missing an opportunity to save money by asking your landlord for cheaper rent.","2021-09-15 15:51:38",post,https://housing-relief.com/should-you-ask-your-landlord-for-cheaper-rent/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_319340627.png,shutterstock_319340627.png,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_319340627.png,5653,shutterstock_319340627,,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_319340627.png,"More Savings",,publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,should-you-ask-your-landlord-for-cheaper-rent,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-09-15 15:51:38"
5655,"How To Make Money With Online Surveys","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

One of the oldest ways to make money on the Internet is by completing surveys. But since this method has been around for so long, it has a bit of a bad rap as being a scam.

Are there online survey sites that will take your info and offer zero compensation for your time? Sure. But there are plenty of sites that offer legit money-making opportunities with their surveys, and here they are:

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h3>Legitimate Online Survey Sites</h3>
<h4>Harris Poll Online</h4>
If you’ve never completed online surveys before, you probably want to start with a trusted resource. Harris Poll Online is just that.

You can complete surveys on the go using your smartphone. As you go, you’ll earn points that can be converted into gift cards or cash. In working with Harris, you’ll be offering your opinion on items from household brands to nonprofits and even governments. And if you’re looking for another way to earn points through this source, you can do so with ShopTracker, where you reveal what you purchased over the last month.
<h4>Vindale Research</h4>
Here’s an online survey option that pays quite the pretty penny. You can earn up to $75 per survey, which is a nice chunk of change for relatively simple work. Once your account balance hits $50, you can request a payout via check or PayPal.

Besides completing surveys, Vindale Research lets you earn rewards by dropping your opinion on videos you watch.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Survey Junkie</h4>
Another popular site for making quick online cash is Survey Junkie. Many people use it to earn points that can translate into cash and gift cards later on. And while you’re probably completing surveys just for the rewards, there’s the added benefit of knowing your opinion will be used to help create and shape products for public consumption.

You’ll be glad to know that several companies have decided to give customers a break on their utility, phone, and Internet bills.

Whether it’s through waiving late fees/penalties, easing shutoffs, or postponing payments, a slew of companies across the U.S. are making it easier for families to keep the lights on and stay connected.

Then keep reading, as we’ll show you just how easy it can be thanks to some side gigs.

What could an extra $400 per month do for your family? It could certainly make it easier to put food on the table, as well as make a dent in your rent. Depending on your savings and income, you could also use that money to treat yourself by having a bit more cash for splurging.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Whatever the use, $400 or more would be helpful. And while you could ask for more hours at work or get a second “formal” job to get there, we’ll show you how to do so via some simple side gigs.
<h4>Work 16 Hours per Month as an Amazon Flex Driver</h4>
Do you have four free hours per week? Use them to deliver packages for Amazon Flex, and you could easily reach the monthly $400 goal.

Since Amazon Flex pays as much as $25 per hour, it would only take 16 hours to rake in $400. And since you can make your schedule, you could earn a lot more than that as well.

What do you need to work as an Amazon driver?
<ul>
 	<li>Pass a background check.</li>
 	<li>Have a smartphone.</li>
 	<li>Have a car.</li>

<h4>Earn $452 per Month by Wrapping Your Car</h4>
Have you ever seen a car around town that’s fully wrapped in advertisements? While it may have looked interesting and caught your eye, that was probably somebody’s side gig.

Wrapify.com is a site that wraps people’s cars with advertisements. In exchange for that publicity, the car owners get paid.

If you get your car wrapped from front to back with ads, you can earn up to $452 per month. If you get just a “lite” wrap with ads on your doors and back window, that’ll earn you $280 per month. Either way, you get a nice chunk of change for doing nothing more than you usually do, which is drive.
<h4>Sit Someone Else’s House for $1,000 Monthly</h4>
This side gig is aimed more towards someone who doesn’t have kids, has a ton of freedom, and wants to travel while keeping a ton of money in their pocket.

House sitting involves taking care of someone’s home while they’re away on vacation or business. Here are some of the tasks involved, besides simply staying in the home and ensuring everything is okay:
<ul>
 	<li>Taking care of pets.</li>
 	<li>Light housekeeping.</li>
 	<li>Watering plants.</li>
 	<li>Receiving deliveries.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

That’s not too tough, is it? Of course not, and as for how much you can make, many house sitters clear $1,000 easily, depending on the location.

Sit houses in NYC or LA, and you can make as much as $100 per night. Factor in the costs of lodging that you won’t have to pay, and the “income” is much higher than that, especially since you could be sitting some houses that are quite luxurious.

Would you like to cut it while keeping your family entertained? Then try these streaming services that are free and full of content for everyone.

While cable has been a staple of households for decades, many now see it as obsolete. Thanks to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, etc., you can cut the cord to watch what you want, when you want.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Unfortunately, some streaming services have a problem of their own: Cost. So while having one service like Netflix, for example, is cheaper than cable, adding another, like Hulu, will start to add up.

Are all streaming services paid? No, as the following won’t cost you a thing. And while they may not be as well-known as Netflix and Hulu, the fact that they’re free while still offering tons of content may make them more appealing.
<h4>Installing an HD Antenna</h4>
Before we jump into our list of free streaming services, it’s worth noting that you may want to install an HD antenna before cutting the cord. Doing so will give you local channels for news, networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX, and more at zero monthly cost. And best of all, you’ll get a crystal clear HD picture.

Then, once you have the antenna installed, you can add these free streaming services to round out your no-cost entertainment package.

<h4>Pluto TV</h4>
Would you like a quick replacement for your cable lineup? Pluto TV can give you that for free with hundreds of channels covering every genre.

What’s the best part about Pluto? The fact that it has channels dedicated solely to popular TV shows, which will help you reconnect with some of your favorites from the past.

Is Pluto just live TV? No, as it also has tons of TV shows and movies on-demand, so you’ll never run out of things to watch.
<h4>Tubi</h4>
A quick look at Tubi reveals a similar format to Netflix. But unlike Netflix, you won’t have to pay a penny to enjoy Tubi’s impressive catalog of movies and shows.
<h4>Vudu</h4>
Here’s another free streaming service that looks like Netflix. Whether you’re looking to binge popular TV shows or enjoy a massive catalog of movies on-demand, you can do it with Vudu while keeping all of your cash in your pocket.
<h4>Crackle</h4>
Netflix and Hulu reel in customers thanks to their original content, movies, and TV shows. Crackle can do the same, only without having to pay for it.
<h4>The Roku Channel</h4>
Do you need a Roku device to enjoy this free streaming service? No, as you can watch it from your laptop to enjoy movies, TV shows, news, and much more.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Free Hulu</h4>
A great way to enjoy new content without piling on new costs is to switch paid streaming services. For instance, one month, you can binge Netflix. The following month, you can pause or cancel Netflix and switch to Hulu.

Even better, you can use free trials to enjoy that content without having to pay. For new customers, Hulu has a one-month trial that’ll let you see what the service has to offer with no commitment.","Are you unhappy with your cable programming?

The U.S. Department of Treasury has billions of dollars waiting to help families who struggled to pay the rent during the pandemic. While this is good news, there’s one very bad aspect of it all: Many people have no idea how to get their hands on that money.

If you’re one of them, don’t fret, as the following questions and answers should give you a clear path to getting the rent assistance you need.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>1. Where is all of the emergency rental assistance money?</h4>
Although the U.S. Department of Treasury is in charge, state and local programs have the money to help families pay the rent.
<h4>2. How can you apply for emergency rent assistance?</h4>
As stated, state and local programs have all of the cash that’s waiting to be doled out. Each of those programs has its own policies and procedures. For example, in some regions, you can apply for rent assistance directly. In others, your landlord will have to start the process.

Keeping all of this in mind, you will have to apply through your local program. Since there are nearly 500 of them across the country, <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">use this link to find the program that pertains to your situation</a>. If you have no luck, dial 211 on your phone and ask for rental assistance. You can also contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA). Any one of those should be able to point you in the right direction.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>3. Does emergency rental assistance only cover your monthly rent costs?</h4>
Luckily, the answer to this question is no, as other housing costs may be impossible to pay during the pandemic. The federal government’s ERA program covers much more than just the rent, as it can also help you with:
<ul>
 	<li>Electricity</li>
 	<li>Gas (for your home)</li>
 	<li>Water</li>
 	<li>Sewer</li>
 	<li>Trash removal</li>
 	<li>Internet</li>
 	<li>Late fees</li>
 	<li>Moving expenses</li>
 	<li>Other fees related to your rent, such as application fees, screening fees, and security deposits if you have to move.</li>
</ul>
Depending on your location, you may even get help with legal representation, case management, and housing counseling via the ERA program. To see what’s covered in your area, contact your local program using the link above.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. What does it take to be eligible for emergency rental assistance?</h4>
This may depend on your location, but basic eligibility for the ERA program requires the following:
<ul>
 	<li>You must have an agreement to pay rent for wherever you live, whether it’s a house, apartment, mobile home, or other dwelling. Know that a signed lease isn’t necessary, as long as some sort of agreement exists.</li>
 	<li>At least one household member lost income, is eligible for unemployment, had financial hardships, or owes significant expenses.</li>
 	<li>Based on your location, your household income sits below a certain level.</li>
 	<li>At least one household member is suffering from housing instability, meaning they’re having trouble finding housing or could become homeless.</li>
</ul>
Even if you think you don’t qualify based on the info above, contact your local program, as they will be able to determine your emergency rental assistance eligibility thanks to their expert counselors on the topic.","The Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program can keep a roof over your family’s head during these challenging times.

5676,"How To Prove You Qualify For Emergency Rental Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

The answer is no, which is why you’ll have to prove you need such assistance, and we’ll show you how.

Even though most of the population was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in one way or another, there’s not enough emergency rental assistance to go around. In other words, you have to show that you have a significant financial need and you need help with paying your rent since evictions are back in play.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

How can you prove that financial need? There are four basic requirements you must meet, which we’ll discuss now. Before we jump in, take note that your local program will have specific requirements. They may vary from what you see here, so <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find your local program here</a> and give them a call as soon as possible to get all of the details.
<h4>1. Do you have a rental agreement?</h4>
You can’t apply for emergency rental assistance just because you need some extra cash. You have to prove that you pay rent, and you do this via a rental agreement. If you have a signed lease that details your address and the monthly rent payment, that should be enough. If you don’t have that paperwork, though, there are some other ways to prove your status as a renter.

For starters, you could supply check stubs that show your history of paying the rent. Bank statements could work as well. If you have neither, a utility bill may work.
Lastly, you could get a statement from your landlord or draft your own written statement that details your rental agreement.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>2. Do you have housing instability?</h4>
Now that you’ve shown that you pay rent, it’s essential to prove that you’re suffering from housing instability. In other words, you may be on the verge of eviction, and you have a notice to prove it. Or, your current home is unhealthy or unsafe, and you have documentation proving that.

Do you have past-due rent? Bills showing that could demonstrate your housing instability. And if you have past due utility bills, that may work too to fulfill this requirement.
<h4>3. Have you experienced financial hardship?</h4>
Many of us experienced some form of financial hardship due to the pandemic. If you lost a job and the income that came with it, that could be sufficient evidence. Qualifying for unemployment is another form of proof. Do you owe significant expenses that you cannot pay? That qualifies as financial hardship as well.

Your local program will let you know whether you have to show paperwork for this and other requirements, or if a written statement is enough.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. Does your household income sit below a certain level?</h4>
The last eligibility requirement for emergency rental assistance deals with income. Your household income will have to be below a certain level to qualify.

You can show your income via pay stubs, a letter from your employer, tax returns, or unemployment documents. You can also use a written statement in some cases if you don’t have any income, are disabled, your employer cannot be reached, or you lack access to technology.

Since all of this can be confusing or overwhelming, your best bet is to start gathering some documents regarding your rent, income, and hardship and contacting your local rent program now.","Since the new Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program is worth billions, does that mean everyone qualifies?

The coronavirus pandemic triggered a chain reaction that was financially disastrous for many. First, they lost their jobs due to businesses shuttering. Second, they lost the income that came from those jobs. Third, they found it impossible to pay their bills. And lastly, many found themselves wondering where they’d live after not paying the rent.

The government stepped in to stop many of those fears via stimulus checks and extra unemployment benefits. And to help those unable to pay the rent, the CDC implemented a national eviction moratorium to keep landlords from putting people on the streets.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

Joint filers could qualify for eviction protection if they made less than $198,000. Single filers could do the same if their income fell below $99,000. Does this mean rent was waived? No, as back rent plus late fees could rack up, but at least you didn’t have to worry about homelessness.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court struck down the national eviction moratorium on a 6-3 vote. And while some local and state governments (such as Los Angeles County) made moratoriums of their own, you may fear eviction now that the federal protection has ended.

To help make that fear disappear, here are several resources that can come in handy if you’re facing eviction.
<h4>Rent Assistance</h4>
Do you owe back rent? Would you like help with making future rent payments? Do you have past-due utility bills? Or did you incur moving expenses due to the pandemic? If so, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program can help with all of the above.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Nearly 500 state and local programs share the billions of dollars that fund that program, so you’ll have to find your nearest office to get your hands on that cash.

<h4>Emergency Housing</h4>
<a href=""https://www.hudexchange.info/housing-and-homeless-assistance/homeless-help/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The HUD</a> can help you find emergency housing or a shelter, so you don’t end up on the streets due to eviction.
<h4>Other Forms of Assistance</h4>
Have you ever called 211? If not, know that it’s a phone number that can save the day, as it has local operators that can connect you with organizations that offer assistance with food, housing, healthcare, paying bills, and much more.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Legal Help</h4>
You may feel lost due to the stress of the pandemic, lacking income, and facing eviction. That’s why getting the help of legal experts is a must, so you don’t tackle the complex issue of housing alone.

Depending on your situation, you could get a free attorney from <a href=""https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Legal Aid</a>. Contact them if you’ve been threatened with eviction due to lack of payment.

5682,"You’re About To Be Evicted. What Should You Do?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

Many renters received terrible news on August 26, as that’s when the federal eviction moratorium ended. With 90 percent of renters losing such protection, it’s safe to say that millions are now wondering if they’ll get to stay in their homes or be forced to find new housing.

What should you do if it looks like eviction is in your near future? Rather than ignoring the issue that won’t go away on its own, do the following.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Look for Rental Assistance</h4>
Although the end of the national eviction moratorium was horrible news, here’s a silver lining: Congress set aside billions in funding for the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. But even though that much money was allocated for this program, much of the cash has failed to make it into the hands of those who need it most. Why? Because they don’t know the ERA program exists, plus the money is split between almost 500 state and local programs.

You can <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find your local program here</a>. They’ll help you determine eligibility, which is based on four factors. First, you must have housing instability, which could include facing eviction or living in unsafe conditions. Second, your income must fall below a certain level for your area. Third, a household member must be facing financial hardship. And lastly, you must have a rental agreement that demonstrates your address and how much you pay each month.

What can you get if you qualify for the ERA program? Help with paying back and future rent, utility bills, and moving expenses if you had to relocate. In other words, make it a priority to apply to this program as soon as possible.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

While the ERA program gets top billing in helping with the rent, <a href=""https://nlihc.org/era-dashboard"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">use this link</a> from the National Low Income Housing Coalition to find even more rental relief programs.
<h4>See if There’s an Eviction Moratorium in Your Area</h4>
Even though the national eviction moratorium ended, that didn’t stop several areas from starting their own to keep renters protected. Some examples include California, New York, Washington, DC, New Jersey, and Minnesota. Research online to see if your area has such a moratorium in place, as it can buy you some time.
<h4>How to Handle Eviction</h4>
If you know eviction is on the table, but you haven’t been sued yet, you still have time on your side. Ask your landlord if they can set you up with a repayment plan or reduced rent. Letting them know that you’re seeking emergency rental assistance can help with this request. IF they agree, make sure you get everything in writing.

If you’ve already been sued for eviction, look for legal assistance. The <a href=""https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/flh-free-legal-help/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">American Bar Association</a> can help you find free legal help. <a href=""https://justshelter.org/community-resources/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">JustShelter.org</a> can also offer eviction assistance.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

5685,"Do This To Pick The Most Affordable Cell Phone Plan","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

<h4>If you primarily use your phone at home when on Wi-Fi:</h4>
Many people find themselves at home a lot more lately, which means they’ll likely use Wi-Fi instead of costly data to stream video and FaceTime. If you’re one of them, and you’re incredibly disciplined about not streaming or video chatting on data when out and about, you may want a prepaid, limited data plan.

By switching to a prepaid plan with little data, you could shave as much as $50 off your monthly bill. Examples include AT&amp;T and Verizon, which offer 7GB data plans that won’t cost a pretty penny.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>If your data usage varies each month:</h4>
Since data can be so costly, you don’t want to waste it. Some carriers lead to such waste, however, by not giving you back unused data.

Opt for a plan that lets you roll over any unused data to the next month to avoid this problem.
One example is Verizon’s Shared Data Plan, which costs $30 monthly for 5GB of data.
<h4>If you can’t go without insurance:</h4>
Did you buy the priciest phone and are worried you’ll drop it? Even worse, are you known to misplace your phones from time to time? If so, cell phone insurance coverage can come in handy, but it can also be costly.

Getting insurance from your carrier can add as much as $36 to your monthly bill. To avoid this expense, see if your credit card company covers insurance if you use their card to pay for your bill. If not, you can go with a company like SquareTrade, which can offer protection and warranties for just $5 monthly.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>If you have a family:</h4>
One of the easiest ways to overpay for your cell phone is to have multiple lines that are separate. Not only is this costly, but it’s also a hassle to ensure all of those lines get paid on time each month.

Instead of taking the separate route, get a family plan. For example, you can get four lines from the T-Mobile Magenta Family Plan for only $140 per month. By making such a switch, you can shed $10 off the cost of each line and keep that money in your pocket.
<h4>If you barely use data:</h4>
Although cell phones work wonders for video chatting, watching movies, listening to music, and more, some people only use them to text. If this sounds like you, know that texting hardly uses data, which is why you may want to switch to a cheaper plan.

Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) like Ting, Google Fi, and Consumer Cellular offer cheap plans for non-data users, so give them a look.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>If you frequently use data:</h4>
On the opposite side of the spectrum are people who like to video chat or stream on the go. Such usage is best matched to an unlimited data plan to avoid costly overage charges. Mint Mobile offers such a plan for only $30 per month.","If you’re unhappy with what you’re paying for your cell phone, chances are that plan doesn’t fit your needs. Here are some quick tips for picking the right plan to keep those costs down.","2021-10-08 20:20:08",post,https://housing-relief.com/do-this-to-pick-the-most-affordable-cell-phone-plan/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_71997460.jpg,shutterstock_71997460.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_71997460.jpg,5690,"Beautiful,Woman,Talking,On,Her,Cell,Phone",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_71997460.jpg,Resources,"Rental Assistance",publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,do-this-to-pick-the-most-affordable-cell-phone-plan,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-08 20:27:46"

When a developer is making a website, app, or game, they have to ensure that it’s bug-free and offers a solid user experience. One way they do this is by having others test their creations and sharing their feedback.

You can make money as a tester without having to devote much time out of your busy schedule. And, depending on the gig, you could make a decent chunk of change for work that’s fun and interesting.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

What does it take to become a tester? Besides signing up on the sites that offer the gigs, you’ll need basic skills like communicating your thoughts effectively and being a bit tech-savvy. You’ll also need a computer or smartphone that has a microphone and camera so you can give feedback, plus an Internet connection.

With that out of the way, let’s look at where you can start finding website testing work that pays.
<h4>Ferpection</h4>
Testing on Ferpection is pretty simple. You complete missions using your tablet, smartphone, or computer by answering questions or taking screenshots. A 45-minute test could put $25 in your pocket, which is paid via PayPal once a month.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>Intuit User Research</h4>
Have you ever done your taxes with TurboTax? If so, you can test out newer versions of the software and other Intuit offerings like Mint and QuickBooks here.

You’ll be tasked with trying out the software and telling users the pros and cons of your experience. Tests can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as two hours. The longer, the better, as each 30-minute interval can yield a $50 Visa Rewards Card.
<h4>IntelliZoom Panel</h4>
You’ll be testing websites for both desktop and mobile if you sign up for the IntelliZoom Panel. Tests are short and in the 10 to 20-minute range. A quick survey can pay $2, while a video submission can result in a $10 payment. It will take you about three weeks to get paid after you complete a study.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Respondent</h4>
You have several different options to make money on Respondent. You can do the usual website testing and surveys, or participate in focus groups.

Out of all of the testing sites, Respondent is one of the most lucrative to work for. For example, you could be lucky enough to get a testing gig that pays $100 for an hour of work, or you could earn $40 in 20 minutes.

To get gigs here, you’ll need to check-in and see what projects are available.
<h4>Test IO</h4>
On Test IO, it pays to pay attention. When testing an app, game, or website, you can earn $50 for finding a glitch. And if it’s a significant issue that you discovered, you’ll make even more money.

Do you need to find glitches to get paid? No, as you can also earn money by rating whatever you test.","Did you know that you can make money online by testing websites, apps, and even games?

Certain organizations know that not every family has the luxury of putting their own food on the table. This can be especially true during Thanksgiving, which can be quite an expensive holiday when it comes to food.

Which organizations can give your family a full Thanksgiving meal or some of the holiday’s supplies at no cost? Here they are:
<h4>United Way</h4>
With over 1,800 United Way local offices around the world, you’re bound to <a href=""https://www.unitedway.org/find-your-united-way"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find one near you</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

While this organization works year-round, they’re particularly helpful in filling families’ stomachs during the holiday season.

Depending on where you live, your United Way may have events where local volunteers give out hearty holiday meals or host turkey drives.

In Palm Beach County, Florida, for example, Project Thanksgiving has helped low-income families indulge in all of the holiday’s goodies for the last 29 years.
<h4>Food Banks</h4>
Have you done your best to save up for a turkey, but just can’t buy one? A turkey drive from your local food bank could solve that issue. They could also help by giving you and your loved ones a full Thanksgiving meal.

Turkey distribution dates vary according to location. You can <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find your local food bank here</a> to see how the process works.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Depending on the food bank, there may be some eligibility requirements that take your family’s income into account.
<h4>Churches</h4>
You may be able to find free Thanksgiving lunch or dinner from your nearest church or faith-based group. If you are not religious, do not worry, as most will not discriminate based on religion, race, or similar factors.

Churches and their members get together during the holidays to not only celebrate, but also to help those in need. In other words, if your family needs Thanksgiving food, don’t hesitate to visit your local church to find some.

The food offered by churches can vary. It often comes from members and volunteers, but local stores and restaurants can also provide food for the occasion.
<h4>Salvation Army</h4>
You may know the Salvation Army from its volunteers that ring bells in front of stores seeking donations. But did you know that this organization also offers free Thanksgiving meals?

They do, and much of the food served comes from donations from the public plus local stores and businesses.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

If you choose the Salvation Army for your free Thanksgiving meal, you will likely enjoy it at a specific, predetermined site. If you or a loved one are sick or elderly, however, you could get your meal delivered in a food box.

During the dinner, be sure to ask around about the Salvation Army’s other social services. You can sign up for them to receive additional help during the holidays in the form of food or even coats to help with the winter cold.

You can find your local Salvation Army <a href=""https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/plugins/gdosCenterSearch?start=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.

Here are various ways you can seek assistance regarding lost income, unemployment, food, utilities, and healthcare.
<h4>Coronavirus Stimulus Checks</h4>
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act can provide some much-needed cash in two main ways.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

The first is via $1,200 stimulus checks for individuals or $2,400 for couples that qualify based on income.

Here are the basic requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Individual – Gets $1,200 if they have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $75,000 or less.</li>
 	<li>Married couple filing a joint return – Gets $2,400 if their combined income is $150,000 or less.</li>
 	<li>Head of household who’s a single parent with at least one child living at home for over half the year – Gets $1,200 check if their AGI is less than $112,500.</li>
 	<li>Children under 16 in the household – Extra $500.</li>
</ul>
Single people making more than $75,000 can earn up to $99,000 and still qualify for a smaller check. The same holds for couples with a combined income of up to $198,000. Heads of households can earn up to $136,500 to qualify for a smaller check too.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Tax returns from 2018 or 2019 will be used to determine eligibility. Not filing taxes for either of those years may affect your eligibility. Those who do not have a Social Security number, nonresident aliens, or dependents will not be eligible.
<h4>Unemployment Compensation From the Cares Act</h4>
Beyond $1,200 stimulus checks, the CARES Act also addresses issues with unemployment benefits. Although states offer their own unemployment compensation, the CARES Act will provide $600 extra per week for those who qualify. These benefits are expected to last for a maximum of 13 weeks.

Regarding eligibility, here is how the CARES Act defines an unemployed person:

A worker who was furloughed, laid off, or has proof of missed income or employment due to the coronavirus. Part-time workers, gig workers, and freelancers are included in this definition if they’ve been affected by work changes as a result of COVID-19.
<h4>State Unemployment Assistance</h4>
States have unemployment programs that can boost your income even more. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average weekly unemployment benefit is $385.

You can apply to your state’s unemployment program by using the Department of Labor’s <a href=""https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/Find-Unemployment-Benefits.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">CareerOneStop tool</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Food Assistance</h4>
There are various programs available for families who need help purchasing food. They include:
<ul>
 	<li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</li>
 	<li>SNAP for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</li>
</ul>
On a local level, food pantries and charities like the Salvation Army and United Way may be able to help.
<h4>Utilities Assistance</h4>
Some utility companies have relaxed billing during the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce the negative economic impact families are currently experiencing. You can contact your local companies to see if they’ve made any changes to their billing procedures. If not, you can ask them for options regarding payment plans by explaining your situation.

Another option is to consult the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which offers assistance with heating and cooling costs for families in need.
<h4>Healthcare Coverage</h4>
If you’ve become unemployed or have a lapse of employment during the COVID-19 outbreak, COBRA Continuation Coverage may help. You can also consult Medicaid or Medicare to see if they can give you the coverage you need during these uncertain times.","Are you worried about how you’ll keep your family afloat during the coronavirus crisis?

To get you up to speed on how WIC works, let’s look at some common questions and answers on the program.
<h4>1. Who qualifies for WIC?</h4>
Here is a basic list of who is eligible for WIC:
<ul>
 	<li>Women who are pregnant, in the postpartum stage, or are breastfeeding</li>
 	<li>Infants</li>
 	<li>Children up to age five</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

Keep in mind that three other main requirements must be met to qualify for WIC beyond those in the list. First, income guidelines must be met. There are two ways to meet this requirement. You can either fall within the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines, which can be found here, or you can become automatically income-eligible via participation in other benefits programs.

For instance, if you or someone in your household receives SNAP benefits or Medicaid, that alone could satisfy WIC’s income requirements.

After income, comes the nutritional risk requirement. A health professional will determine this during what is often a free screening. They will take height and weight measurements, plus test the blood for anemia. Other tests may be performed as well to determine if you have a nutritional risk that falls into one of two categories:
<ol>
 	<li>Medically-based risk – Problems related to pregnancy, underweight, anemia, etc.</li>
 	<li>Diet-based risk – Deficient diet.</li>
</ol>
Lastly, you must meet the state residency requirement. This does not require you to live in a particular place for a specific period, but it does ask that you live in the state where you apply for benefits.
<h4>2. What type of benefits does WIC provide?</h4>
Beneficiaries of WIC food assistance can receive items similar to the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Infant cereal</li>
 	<li>Iron-fortified adult cereal</li>
 	<li>Vegetable juice</li>
 	<li>Vitamin C-rich fruit juice</li>
 	<li>Eggs</li>
 	<li>Milk</li>
 	<li>Cheese</li>
 	<li>Peanut butter</li>
 	<li>Dried and canned beans or peas</li>
 	<li>Canned fish</li>
 	<li>Soy-based beverages</li>
 	<li>Tofu</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Baby foods</li>
 	<li>Whole wheat bread</li>
 	<li>Iron-fortified infant formula</li>
</ul>

Depending on the state agency, some food packages may be delivered to beneficiaries’ homes. Others may receive checks, vouchers, or EBT cards to make purchases of accepted foods.

Getting your degree is a great goal to have, but at what expense? You don’t want to leave college with thousands of dollars in debt that can wreak havoc on your post-school budget.

And while you could work and save to fund your education, getting grants is an even better option since they’re practically free money.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h3>The Difference Between Grants and Student Loans</h3>
This point cannot be repeated enough: Student loans and grants are not the same things! In fact, they couldn’t be any more different because you have to pay back student loans. Grants, on the other hand, leave you free and clear of debt.
<h4>Are Grants and Scholarships the Same Thing?</h4>
While grants and student loans are different, the same holds true for grants and scholarships. Like grants, you won’t have to pay back a scholarship. How they differ, however, is that grants are often awarded on a needs basis. Scholarships, meanwhile, are often distributed according to merit and sometimes need.

So, while you can get a grant due to low income, a scholarship may factor in things like your grades, extracurricular activities, etc.
<h3>How To Get College Grants</h3>
There are many ways to secure grants for college. For this quick guide, we will focus on three primary sources:

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>1. Federal college grants</h4>
To get federal grants for college, you should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Filling it out gives universities insight into whether or not you are eligible for financial aid.

Once your FAFSA is complete, you may receive financial aid award letters from colleges that have accepted you. These letters will inform you of college grants you could qualify for.

It's urgent to act as soon as you receive these letters. College grants are limited and are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so you’ll want to get the ball rolling as soon as possible to get a piece of the pie.

As for the different types of federal government grants for college, here’s a sampling:
<ul>
 	<li>Academic Competitiveness Grant – Given to qualifying freshmen and sophomores in college.</li>
 	<li>Federal Pell Grants – A very popular option that is awarded based on financial need.</li>
 	<li>Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants – Awarded to undergraduate students from low-income households.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>2. College Grants from your state</h4>
The Department of Education has state grant agencies that can offer funding after you’ve exhausted all of the federal resources. To find your state’s agency, go here.
<h4>3. Grants from your college</h4>
Some colleges have grants of their own. After you’ve gone through the federal and state routes, contact your college’s financial aid office to see what they have available.

Are these the only ways to find grants to fund your college education? No, but they’re an excellent place to start. The goal is to apply for as many grants as possible and do an extensive search so you can minimize your out of pocket expenses when paying for school.","Don’t let the student loan debt scare you off from college. Get grants instead, and don’t pay that money back.","2021-10-12 17:50:24",post,https://housing-relief.com/how-to-find-college-grants/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1757465525.jpg,shutterstock_1757465525.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1757465525.jpg,5707,"College,Community.,Group,Of,Smiling,Multi-ethnic,Students,Posing,At,Campus,",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1757465525.jpg,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,how-to-find-college-grants,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-12 17:50:24"
5709,"4 Reasons Why Seniors Should Apply For SNAP Food Benefits","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Ad Slot 1 -->

If you’ve been around for some time but have never applied for SNAP, you may be wondering what it is. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is its formal name, and you probably know it by the more commonly used moniker of “food stamps.”

Why apply for SNAP if you’ve been putting food on your table for all of these years? Because as a senior, you may need that extra assistance after moving to a fixed income. You may have lost a spouse, making it harder to keep food in your kitchen. Or you may simply notice that your nutrition is lacking, and you don’t have the funds to ensure your diet is up to snuff on your own.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

While getting monthly funds for food via SNAP is this program’s most obvious benefit, it can lead to several life improvements for seniors. Here are just a few that should give you that nudge you need to apply for those food stamps today:
<h4>1. You may be eligible for SNAP without even knowing it.</h4>
You’re about to see many health-related reasons why seniors need SNAP. But before we jump into those, it’s worth noting that three in five seniors are eligible for food stamps, but do not receive them.

Perhaps they don’t know the program exists. However, you now know so to apply for SNAP and see if you’re eligible, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">go here</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->

<h4>2. SNAP allows you to put money away for life-saving expenses.</h4>
In 2018, one study found that SNAP recipients were more likely to refill their prescriptions and never miss doses of their medication. This was due to the money they saved on food, which allowed them to put it towards medicine.

Prescriptions aren’t the only form of healthcare that becomes more accessible to seniors on SNAP, however. Another study by the University of Massachusetts Boston found that SNAP recipients over 60 used their food savings towards nursing home care, home health care, doctor visits, and hospital stays.
<h4>3. SNAP can cut healthcare costs.</h4>
Research shows that seniors on SNAP are less likely to be hospitalized, and those who go to the hospital often have shorter stays that are more affordable.

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>4. SNAP fills a nutritional void that boosts senior health.</h4>
Insufficient nutrition and food security can lead seniors down a scary path. If an older adult lacks the food they need, they can lose muscle mass, bone density, and balance. This can lead them to fall, which can break bones and result in other serious health issues that can eliminate their independence. They can also have a more challenging time healing after falls, surgeries, etc. if they lack food.

Chronic conditions can also arise in seniors who suffer from food insecurity. Those conditions can worsen due to the stress that comes from financial problems and not being able to buy food. With SNAP, you can break this vicious cycle to reduce stress, keep chronic conditions at bay, and live out the rest of your years in good health.","You may have wanted to apply for SNAP to fill your fridge and cupboard, but if you’re a senior, you’re about to see why this food assistance program offers even better benefits.","2021-10-12 17:58:39",post,https://housing-relief.com/4-reasons-why-seniors-should-apply-for-snap-food-benefits/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_411508150.jpg,shutterstock_411508150.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_411508150.jpg,5710,"Elder,Eating,Apple",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_411508150.jpg,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,4-reasons-why-seniors-should-apply-for-snap-food-benefits,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-12 17:58:39"

That bigger fuel or grocery bill isn’t a figment of your imagination, as the cost of many items has gone up in recent months. To be specific, in July, we saw our biggest jump in inflation since 2008, as consumer prices rose 5.4 percent. That means you have to change the way you shop if you don’t want your budget to burst, and here are some tips to help you do just that.

[the_ad_group id=""27""]<!-- Ad Slot 2 -->

<h4>Save at the Grocery Store</h4>
It’s painful to shop as you always do, only to see a bigger number ring up when you check out. While some say higher grocery prices are temporary, they could still get more expensive in these coming months, so try the following to minimize your bill:
<ul>
 	<li>Never shop hungry – Eat something before hitting the grocery store. It will prevent purchases of costly, prepared foods to help silence your growling stomach.</li>
 	<li>Never shop without a list – Make a list of things you need to buy, then stick to it in the store. This will also prevent costly impulse purchases.</li>
 	<li>Buy store brands – You’ve probably noticed that most grocery stores now have their own brands of items. Not only are they usually cheaper than brand names, but they’re also the same thing in terms of ingredients.</li>
 	<li>Purchase in bulk – It’s no secret that buying in bulk usually helps you save. You can split bulk purchases with friends or family to save cash and storage space.</li>
[the_ad_group id=""58""]<!-- Ad Slot 3 -->
 	<li>Look for BOGO deals – You’ll get double the bang for your buck with buy one, get one free sales, which can be plentiful, depending on where you shop.</li>
 	<li>Stop buying disposable products – Gone are the days when you can waste money on disposable items if you’re looking to save. So, instead of buying paper towels, use cloth towels. Or, instead of buying water bottles you toss in the trash, buy one reusable bottle you can refill as needed.</li>
 	<li>Cut produce costs – You can save on fruits and veggies by buying them in season, opting for the frozen varieties, or going to cheaper farmers' markets.</li>
 	<li>Try occasional meat alternatives – Meat may be your most expensive purchase, so try to cut back on it a few times a week with alternatives like lentils, beans, etc.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""59""]<!-- Ad Slot 4 -->

<h4>Save at the Gas Pump</h4>
Rising gas costs are putting a dent in the wallets of many households. To combat these costs, try these tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Carpool – It will not only save on gas, but it can also reduce the hassle of having to drive yourself every day.</li>
 	<li>Get gas rewards – Your favorite gas station likely has a card you can sign up for to make each gallon less costly.</li>
 	<li>Use an app – GasBuddy makes it simple to find the cheapest gas station in your city, which can make a massive difference in the cost of each gallon.</li>
</ul>","Are you tired of paying more at the pump and the grocery store? Well, since prices may not drop anytime soon, you’ll have to make these moves to save your hard-earned cash.","2021-10-12 18:01:48",post,https://housing-relief.com/how-to-save-on-gas-and-food-as-prices-increase/,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_111419282.jpg,shutterstock_111419282.jpg,/chroot/home/a0aac8ff/ca1903d507.nxcli.net/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_111419282.jpg,5713,"Pumping,Gas,At,Gas,Pump.,Closeup,Of,Man,Pumping,Gasoline",,,,https://housing-relief.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_111419282.jpg,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,3,HousingReliefWP,author@housing-relief.com,Housing,Relief,how-to-save-on-gas-and-food-as-prices-increase,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-12 18:01:48"
