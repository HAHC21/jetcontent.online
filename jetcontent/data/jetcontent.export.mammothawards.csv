<strong>1. Use online coupons</strong>

Couponing online has gotten really easy. Visit sites like RetailMeNot or CouponCodes, and you’ll have access to discounts on everyday products. Codes work for a diverse selection of retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, and Macy’s. When you check out, you’ll see the words “promo code.” Just copy and paste your code into the field, and that’s it. You’ll be astounded by the rewards you can reap.
Meanwhile, Amazon has an entire section of its website dedicated to coupons. Here, you can find discounts in specific categories, such as groceries, electronics, and office supplies. The coupons get even more enticing for Prime Members. Get coupons on Amazon while you shop.

<strong>2. Get free music (or even rent it)</strong>

As a music fan you really don't have to buy music at all. Long gone are the days of CDs but now people aren't really even purchasing music with subscription services like Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora.

If you’re already an Amazon Prime member. Many people enjoy their first year of Prime without ever knowing they can download music for free. Yes, you can stream songs, but you can also choose from more than a million MP3s to keep on your phone or computer.

Even if you aren't an Amazon Prime member, streaming services like pandora offer a free version. If you add up savings over 1 or 2 years, you make rethink how much you care about skipping the commercials.

<strong>3. Watch your smart phone’s data</strong>

Smartphones are more powerful than ever, enabling you to use GPS, Skype friends in Japan, and stream videos while sitting on a boat in the middle of a bay. These are amazing features, of course, but they also devour your data.
If you don’t have an unlimited data plan, you may run out of juice before your next billing cycle. Buying more data is generally expensive, and you’re forced to add a gig or two because your phone is useless otherwise.
My suggestion is to either secure an unlimited data plan, especially if you use heavyweight apps on the go, or just carefully watch your data. You can always track how much data you have left, either through your phone’s settings or by downloading your provider’s app. 5 ways to drastically reduce your smartphone’s data usage.

<strong>4. Wait to upgrade your phone</strong>

Waiting to upgrade your phone can yield big cost savings.
You don’t have to tell me: Phones get better every year. Every incarnation comes with its exciting new features, like improved battery life and camera resolution. So once the next iPhone or Galaxy becomes available, why should you wait to snatch it from the display case?
For one, it’s expensive. The people who camp overnight in front of the Apple store don’t mind spending up to $1,000 on the latest model, but most of us don’t have the spare capital. If your phone is working nicely and it’s still in good physical condition, there’s no particular reason to upgrade.",,"2021-05-26 02:55:23",post,https://mammothawards.com/simple-ways-to-save-money-online/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/simple_feat.jpg,simple_feat.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/simple_feat.jpg,56,simple_feat,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/simple_feat.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,simple-ways-to-save-money-online,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-06-30 13:30:04"

<h2><strong>Flights</strong></h2>
<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.kayak.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kayak</a>- This website will compare the cost of all the airlines from the airport you're departing from to the airport you're looking to arrive.

They sometimes offer enough miles to pay for your next round-trip flight and will offer you a statement credit (money off your credit card statement) your first month.

Don't skip the regional airlines. Everyone checks out the major airports and the major airlines but sometimes some regional airlines fly out at a much cheaper cost. Some regional airlines to start are <a href=""https://www.spirit.com/""> Spirit Airlines</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.allegiantair.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwodrXBRCzARIsAIU59TI6LFPLVFeJ5rlxS321XJcEg60Zk6cyV_JZ2TgfW_dAV8N3b8BF9F8aAjavEALw_wcB"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Allegiant Air</a>, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flyfrontier.com/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Frontier</a>. These airlines usually have much stricter luggage restrictions and offer fewer comforts but in turn, you keep a lot more money in your pocket.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think of all the investment involved with going to the grocery store. First, you need to gas up your car to get there. Second, you need to waste that gas as you sit in traffic. Third, you must spend tons of time walking through crowds and going from aisle to aisle. Last, but not least, you have to haul it all home.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, grocery store shopping is a massive chore that many of us wish we could avoid. But thanks to several delivery services, you can completely avoid it and save time and money in the process. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are some of your top home delivery options. Visit their sites to get a closer look at how they operate so that you can make the right choice for your shopping needs. Some even offer a free trial:</span>

<b>Postmates</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you live in a big city and want groceries without leaving your couch, </span><a href=""https://postmates.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">give Postmates a look</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The Postmates Unlimited service offers free delivery on orders over $15 for a fee of just under $100 per year. If you’re not an Unlimited member, you’ll pay $2.99 per delivery.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can give Postmates a try via a 7-day free trial.</span>
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<b>Instacart</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can </span><a href=""https://www.instacart.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">access over 300 retailers via Instacart across all 50 states</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. While many claim Instacart’s prices are higher than what you’d pay by making the trip yourself, keep in mind your savings. There’s no gas cost involved, and you save time.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instacart charges $3.99 per delivery of $35 or more. You can also sign up for the Instacart Express membership which costs $99 annually. It offers the benefit of free deliveries on orders of $35 or more.</span>
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<b>Amazon Prime Now</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you have an Amazon Prime membership? While you probably enjoy its fast and free 2-day shipping plus the movie and music perks, you can use it for grocery delivery too.</span>

<a href=""https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/primenow""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Amazon Prime Now lets Prime members enjoy groceries to their door at favorable prices</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Many of the product offerings are tied to Whole Foods Market, which could be a good or bad thing depending on personal preference.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Orders via Prime Now are free over $35 and can be expected within a 2-hour window. If your order costs less, you’ll have to pay $4.99 for the convenience.</span>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<b>FreshDirect</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While Instacart and Prime Now have a personal shopper purchase your items right from the grocery store, </span><a href=""https://www.freshdirect.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FreshDirect uses a warehouse for delivery</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Does eliminating a personal shopper from the equation yield extra savings? Not necessarily, so keep that in mind.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A DeliveryPass membership to FreshDirect costs $129 per year, which gets you unlimited free delivery. Non-members must pay $5.99 to $7.99 per shipment, depending on location. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FreshDirect comes with a couple of restrictions. Although the $30 minimum orders aren’t too different from other delivery companies, the time you’ll have to wait is. Delivery windows often begin on the following day, so if you need your items quickly, FreshDirect may not be your best bet.</span>

548,"How to Sell Your Old Clothes Online","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While you may think that no one would want to wear your used clothes, you’d be surprised at how huge the market is for secondhand clothing. Let’s take a look at different online avenues you can use to make fast money out of your overflowing closet.</span>

<h3><b>Selling Used Clothes Locally Versus Online</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s the most significant benefit of selling clothes online versus locally? Your potentially immense audience. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As soon as you post something for sale on the Internet, thousands of pairs of eager eyes can view it. You could also make more money than selling to a local brick-and-mortar store if you have the patience to let your items sit for a bit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s the downside to selling used clothes online? The fact that you’ll have to ship each order out. So if you want to avoid this process of packing and hitting the post office, take the brick-and-mortar route. You’re likely to make less per item, but you’ll eliminate the shipping issue.</span>
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Tips to Increase Your Sales</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The quicker your clothing sells, the faster you’ll have that cash. What’s the best way to get swift sales on any site? Create solid product descriptions that will catch someone’s eye and give them the urge to buy.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take several pictures of your item from different angles. Your smartphone will do, as long as the photos are in good lighting and not blurry.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When creating your product descriptions, be sure to include as many details as possible to facilitate the sale. This includes making it easier for someone to find your listing.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Include the brand of the clothing and what it is. If it’s a button-up shirt, add that detail instead of just listing it as a “shirt.” The more specific, the better. Include the size on the tag, and if you can, take actual measurements since each brand fits differently.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does your item have any unique selling points, such as intricate stitching or rarely-used material? Including that detail could mean the difference between someone buying it or moving on to the next item.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t be shy to reveal any imperfections with your clothing either. The more honest you are, the better. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there’s a small rip or stain, for instance, take a close up picture and disclose it in the description. As long as it’s listed, the buyer has less room to complain or request a refund for something you didn’t communicate. They may try to negotiate a lower price for that imperfection, though.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In short, create the product listing as if you were trying to sell clothes to yourself. Would you buy something that had just one blurry picture and a vague description? Probably not, so don’t create yours as such.</span>
[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<b>Where to Sell Your Clothes Online</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Internet has its fair share of sites to sell your used clothes. Most will take a percentage of the sale as their payment, so there’s no need to pay anything upfront.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are just a few examples:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://www.ebay.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">eBay</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> – Great if you want to sell using an auction system to get higher prices. Rare pieces of clothing can sell well here.</span></li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What is it about spending money that makes it so addictive? Maybe it’s the power you feel from having the ability to buy something new. Perhaps it’s the rush you get from collecting new things. Or maybe you just enjoy the act of spending, even if it’s on a gallon of gas. Well, regardless of why you love spending, loving it too much can get you into trouble. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before your finances get past the point of no return, let’s look at what you can do to get your spending under control.</span>
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<b>Find Other Ways to Entertain Yourself</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many, shopping is a hobby. They’ll spend an entire weekend at the mall walking around as they look for something new to catch their eye. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If this sounds like you, the simplest way to stop constant spending is to find new entertainment alternatives. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Am I suggesting activities like going to the movies or amusement parks? No, as the main goal is to find activities that are 100 percent free.</span>
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You don’t need to part with a single penny to enjoy yourself. Sure, transportation to the destination may have a cost, but the actual activity shouldn’t. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, you can visit a local park and enjoy the weather amongst friends and family. You can invite friends over for a game night that doubles as a bonding experience. You can use your local library to check out free books, DVDs, and other forms of entertainment. You can also keep an eye out for free events in your town that pop up throughout the year.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Get creative, and you’ll find loads of free entertainment options. As you adopt this non-spending tradition, you’ll find yourself having more fun. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You should start seeing a higher bank account balance at the end of each month, too, which will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Once this happens, feel free to pat yourself on the back for your newfound financial discipline.</span>

<b>Avoid Impulse Purchases  </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Review all of your receipts, and you may be surprised at how much of your budget is blown on impulse purchases. With the explosion of online shopping, avoiding impulse purchases is harder than ever.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You are probably used to seeing impulse items near the cash register at the grocery store. Gossip magazines, candy, and other unnecessary things sit there for one reason: To ignite your need to make an impulse purchase. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What usually happens before you exit the store? You end up buying at least one item that you didn’t need.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thanks to the Internet, these impulse purchases are everywhere you go. To avoid them, make the following moves:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Delete your saved credit card information from all websites – Having to enter it before each purchase makes you less likely to click and buy continually.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clear your browser history and bookmarks – Eliminating easy access to sites where you spend money can keep more money in your wallet.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Start to block – Beyond just deleting, start to block websites where you have trouble controlling your spending. </span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Put a sticky note on your cards – Having a note stuck to your cards that says, “Is this necessary?” will remind you to stop an impulse purchase as it’s occurring.</span></li>

576,"How To Use The Open Enrollment Period To Fix Your Medicare Drug Coverage","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->
You may be perfectly pleased with your prescription drug coverage up to this point. You should review that coverage now and possibly change it, however, since the annual open enrollment period allows you to do so from October 15th to December 7th.

What can happen if you don’t review all of the options at your disposal while you still can? You could get a shock in January when you go to the pharmacy and find that your medication is no longer covered.

To avoid that from happening, let’s take a closer look at how taking action during open enrollment can put your prescriptions in order.
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>How Your Prescription Drug Coverage Can Change Each Year</h3>
Why is it a good idea to take a look at your Medicare prescription coverage during open enrollment? In a word, change. Your coverage can change in several ways, and some of those ways may not be favorable to your health or your wallet.

Some plans could add drugs under their umbrella, while others drop medication that could leave you scrambling to find extra income to get what you need. Co-pays can change too, as can deductibles.

Factor in all of these possible changes, and it now becomes clear as to why taking advantage of open enrollment is a smart move.
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h3>The Importance of Medicare Drug Coverage as You Age</h3>
The closer you are to age 65, the more critical it is to check your coverage. Even if you’ve had no need for prescriptions before, statistics show that could change as you get older.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 89 percent of people aged 65 or older take one prescription medication. Over half take four or more. A change in just one medication could rock a person’s finances who’s on a fixed income.

Is having prescription drug coverage under Medicare a must? No, since approximately 30 percent of beneficiaries do not have it. Still, it could become a necessity as time passes by, and making sure you're covered now could prevent problems in the future.

Not signing up for Medicare drug coverage once you are eligible could result in a long-lasting penalty later on. For this reason, having it as a preventative measure could cut long-term costs.
<h3>Getting Drug Coverage During Medicare Open Enrollment</h3>
You can get drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or as a standalone Part D plan that pairs with original Medicare’s Part A and Part B coverage. The open enrollment period allows you to change your coverage should you choose to do so.
[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>Significant Numbers to Know for 2020</h3>
Standalone prescription drug plans are expected to carry a $30 monthly premium, which is down from $32.50 in 2019. Also, if you are enrolled in Medicare Part D, you will have to pay $6,350 out of pocket before you can qualify for catastrophic coverage. This is a big jump from the $5,100 out of pocket figure for 2019.

Luckily, you won’t have to make any decisions in the dark. Visit the Medicare.gov site’s Plan Finder, and you’ll be able to compare plans.","Is your 2020 prescription drug coverage up to snuff?

580,"Cool Ways to Keep More Monthly Cash in Your Pocket","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->
Do you ever feel like life has become a rat race where all you do is work to pay bills? If so, welcome to the club. Luckily, you can reduce that rat race feeling by cutting those bills in a big way.

Does this mean it’s time to cut back? Should you get rid of your cell phone or cut the cord on cable? Not necessarily. In fact, you can keep those monthly services right where they are and still get discounts. We’ll reveal the secret to doing so.
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Using a Service to Lower Your Bills</h3>
One of the most common ways to cut costs is to complain. You could call up your cable company and tell them you no longer need their services. What could they do in return? Offer you a monthly discount to keep you as a paying customer.

While this rate-reducing method has worked for years, what happens if you don’t want to pick up the phone? What if personally complaining isn’t your cup of tea? That’s where a bill negotiating service can come in to save the day.

Maybe you feel like you pay too much for your cell phone. Either the service is too unreliable, or you know there are competitors with more attractive rates. Still, you don’t want to go through the hassle of complaining or switching to another provider. By using a bill negotiator, you can get the final result you seek without the trouble.
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
One such company is TrueBill. Sign up with them, and they can help you get better rates on your bills. You don’t have to pay any money upfront for the service either. They’ll get to work negotiating, and if successful, they’ll take a percentage.

For example, let’s say you want your cable bill lowered while keeping the same channels and perks you currently have. Just snap a photo of the bill, upload it, and TrueBill will look for promo rates and hidden discounts that are available to you.

In addition, they’ll try to get one-time credits applied to your account or negotiate a better rate. Either way, it can’t hurt to try, because as mentioned, you pay nothing upfront.

If you manage to save on your cable bill, you can do the same for your phone bill, Internet, and other services. In other words, you can start to stack some savings rather quickly.
[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>Cancel Unwanted Monthly Subscriptions</h3>
Another way to keep more cash in your pocket is to cancel unnecessary monthly subscriptions.

Old online memberships and even magazine subscriptions can put a dent in your wallet if you don’t cancel them. Why might you keep them if you don’t even use them? Once again, to avoid any hassle.

By having someone else like TrueBill do the dirty work, you can enjoy new savings and clean up your finances with ease.

638,"8 Incredibly Easy Driving Tricks That Can Keep Cash in Your Pocket","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Want to reduce how much you spend getting from point A to point B? Besides walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation, or simply staying home, we’ll look at ways to do so in your very own vehicle.

<h4>1. Plan your trips</h4>
Before you even get into your car to turn it on, map out your trip, especially when you have errands to run.

Having to backtrack to the other end of town because you forgot something can burn pricy fuel fast. If you have a plan, though, you can cut down on mileage that triggers frequent fill-ups.
[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>2. Stop warming up your car</h4>
Letting your car idle in the morning so it can warm up can get costly. In fact, doing it for 15 minutes can waste one quart of gas.

Want another reason to stop warming up your car while letting it idle? You can warm up your engine faster by driving.
<h4>3. Keep an eye on traffic</h4>
Constant slow-downs and complete stops in traffic can decrease your gas mileage. If you look ahead and anticipate them, you can lay off the brakes and the accelerator. By doing so, you can spend less on gas.
<h4>4. Use a light foot and not a lead one</h4>
Do you find yourself taking off at a green light or constantly accelerating aggressively? Such driving habits can burn fuel fast and increase your monthly gasoline expenses.

When you accelerate, do it gently. Over time, you could notice that your gas seems to last longer.
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>5. Approach traffic jams differently</h4>
If you anticipate traffic jams as suggested above, you can lay off the gas as you approach them instead of accelerating and then slamming on the brakes. How can this help you save money? By cutting your gas consumption.

You’ll burn more gas accelerating from a full stop than you will if your car is still moving. For this reason, anticipation and smoother driving can equal savings.
<h4>6. Watch for slow cars</h4>
Driving on the highway can present quite a variety of driving styles. On the one hand, you’ll see cars whipping by you as they surpass the speed limit. On the other, you’ll see cars holding up the left lane as they slowly chug along.

While the fast drivers can be dangerous, the slow drivers can be costly since getting stuck behind them can cause you to slow down. To pass them, you’ll need to accelerate from that slowdown, which burns fuel faster.

Once again, anticipation plays a part in keeping cash in your pocket. Watch for those slow drivers so you don’t find yourself stuck behind them. The steadier your speed and less need to change lanes, the lower your gasoline bill.
[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>7. Watch your speedometer</h4>
We already know that accelerating from a complete stop wastes gas. What about driving fast, though? It can be a cost-increaser too, so try not to drive too fast if you hope to save gas.
<h4>8. Carpool</h4>
As you employ the cost-cutting driving tips above, try bringing someone along for the ride. Then, later on, ask them to return the favor. By carpooling, you can save some serious cash.

The most obvious saving from carpooling comes from fuel costs. If you take turns driving, you won’t have to put gas in your car so often.

Other ways in which carpools save include mileage on your car. The less wear and tear it has, the less you should have to spend on maintenance.

Last, but not least, you can save on car insurance if carpooling cuts how many miles you drive per year. If you find a new carpooling partner, mention it to your auto insurance company. They may charge you less since you reduce your risk of an accident by putting your car on the road less often.","Saving money on automobile expenses doesn’t have to be complicated.

657,"6 Mistakes To Avoid When You’re Completely New To Credit","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Credit can be scary, but the truth is, it can be your friend. How? By allowing you to make purchases in the future without having to fork over a ton of your cash upfront.

The ability to <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/a-one-minute-guide-to-understanding-your-credit-score/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">secure loans, credit cards, and low interest rates in the future</a> depends on your borrowing behavior now. To ensure you’re seen as a good borrower by creditors, be sure to avoid the following mistakes that tend to plague credit newbies.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Accepting any credit card that comes your way.</h3>
Getting your first batch of credit cards may be a priority if you aim to build a solid credit history. You need to be sure those cards are in your best interest, however.

You may receive credit card offers that claim there’s no need to check your credit score. These often come with a catch that includes high interest rates and high fees.

Beware of such offers and do not accept them until you read all of the fine print.
<h3>2. Applying for every credit card you see.</h3>
Sitting on your hands won’t get you approved for credit, but that doesn’t mean you should overdo it when it comes to applications. Loads of rejected applications can negatively impact your credit score.

Even getting accepted for several cards at once could be seen as a red flag. Instead of rushing, aim to build your credit slowly.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Applying for cards without a strategy.</h3>
Getting denied for a credit card isn’t the end of the world. It doesn’t mean you should apply for other cards without thinking things through, though.

Let’s say you get rejected for a major credit card. Don’t apply for other similar cards that are likely to result in the same decision. Aim for cards you’re likely to get accepted for, such as secured cards or store credit cards instead.

In short, you want to avoid an endless routine of apply/deny.
<h3>4. Thinking prepaid cards build a credit history.</h3>
A prepaid card can come in handy for online purchases, paying at the gas pump, and the like. It won’t build your credit history, though.

In other words, don’t use one for a year thinking your credit is slowly climbing. It’s not.
<h3>5. Giving up after being turned down.</h3>
Don’t get flustered from rejection. Speak to lenders and ask them what’s the best move for your situation. In doing so, you may find a direct path towards approval versus tackling this sometimes tough task on your own.

When speaking with the lender, mention any payment history you have, such as from utility bills or rent. If it’s solid, it could help you receive credit.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>6. Taking on bad credit habits from the start.</h3>
Once you get approved for credit, guard it with good habits. Keep your card balance low. Pay off the balance in full, if you can. Last, but not least, make every payment on time.

By following these simple rules, you’ll make obtaining better credit cards and loans in the future a much simpler task.","Are you a newbie when it comes to credit?

672,"Frequently Asked Questions About Habitat For Humanity Housing","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Many people view Habitat for Humanity housing as an option for those living in poverty. Or they see it as a program that gives away free houses to those in need.

While Habitat for Humanity can certainly help out when it comes to housing, it’s not necessarily a program for the impoverished, nor does it give away free homes in a lottery-like setting.

To see what the program is really about and if you qualify, let’s have a look at some frequently asked questions.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. What is Habitat for Humanity’s purpose?</h3>
As written on their website, Habitat for Humanity states that their “vision is of a world where everyone has a decent place to live.”

It is a nonprofit housing organization that functions across local communities worldwide. This includes all 50 of the United States and over 70 countries.

As stated, the group may have a reputation for giving away homes at no cost. In reality, they were formed to ensure that families have access to decent and affordable homes.

<h3>2. How does Habitat for Humanity work?</h3>
People partner with Habitat to help families either build new homes or improve existing ones.

For instance, someone who is disabled, a senior, or simply in need of home improvements can ask Habitat for help in the form of minor repairs, landscaping, painting, and more. They can also ask for a new home, so they have a place that’s safe and decent to live in.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Who builds Habitat for Humanity homes?</h3>
Volunteers work alongside homeowners to build housing for those who are eligible. The way in which communities come together via volunteering to build homes is what makes Habitat for Humanity so famous and unique.

<h3>4. How can you become a Habitat for Humanity homeowner?</h3>
You can apply for Habitat for Humanity housing by visiting their official page here. The selection process is managed at a local level.

Anyone can apply to be a Habitat homeowner. The organization does not consider race, religion, or any other factor that could be regarded as discriminatory.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>5. What does it take to own Habitat for Humanity housing?</h3>
You can take the first step towards being a Habitat for Humanity homeowner by visiting the link above.

Here are some of the basics in terms of who is eligible:
<ul>
 	<li>You will have to show a need for affordable, safe housing that will vary according to your local community.</li>
 	<li>You will have to perform “sweat equity” that includes either helping to build your own home or those of other Habitat homeowners.</li>
 	<li>If you are unable to assist with building Habitat homes physically, you can take homeownership classes instead or do other volunteer work with the organization.</li>
 	<li>You will have to pay a mortgage on your Habitat housing. In keeping with the program’s goals, mortgage payments are usually as affordable as possible.</li>
</ul>","If you think that Habitat for Humanity housing is all about free homes, think again. Here are some frequently asked questions about this program that should give you some clarity.

682,"4 Tips To Save While Shopping For Thanksgiving Food","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may moan and groan at the thought of having to host Thanksgiving at your house. While it is nice to meet with your loved ones, the cost of dinner can put a big dent in your monthly budget.

To ensure that dent is as small as possible, here are some tips to save at the grocery store while grabbing those Thanksgiving goodies.

<h3>1. Ask for help.</h3>
You can reduce your load instantly by asking others to pitch in. If you feel bad about doing this, remember that you’re the one hosting the dinner. That alone incurs some costs, so asking for help is entirely appropriate.

Are you in charge of the turkey or main dish? Great. Ask your guests to bring their distinct sides.

They probably won’t mind, and they'll likely enjoy being asked to participate in showing off their culinary skills.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>2. Go generic.</h3>
Now that your list should be shaved a bit with others helping, it’s time to reduce the costs of what’s on it.

The quickest way to do this is by choosing generic items over brand name ones. By making this simple move, you can spend less, and your guests will be hard-pressed to know the difference.

Should you go generic for every single thing on your list? No, as some products may be worth splurging on, such as cheese, ice cream to go with your pies, and so on.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Again, you can still save here by asking your guests to bring what they like, so if you find your list to be more expensive than you thought, make it a collective effort.

<h3>3. Stay in-season with produce.</h3>
Your desserts and side dishes are likely to be loaded with fruits and vegetables. To minimize their costs, choose in-season produce.

By sticking with seasonal produce, you’ll not only spend less, but you’ll also get better flavor than something that’s out of season or shipped from far away.

Luckily, Thanksgiving has a nice list of in-season fruits and vegetables that should mesh with your meal, such as apples, Brussels sprouts, cranberries, artichokes, winter squash, and pears, among others.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>4. Don’t pay a premium for your main protein.</h3>
Will turkey be the star of your table? That’s fine, but there’s no need to pay a premium for it.

Follow these tips to cut your turkey’s costs:
<ul>
 	<li>Only buy as much as turkey as you need – The general rule is one pound of turkey per guest. For extra leftovers, buy 1.5 pounds per guest.</li>
 	<li>Purchase pieces, not extra turkeys – Are you scared of coming up short? Buy some extra legs or breasts instead of another whole turkey.</li>
 	<li>Buy frozen, not fresh – As long as you have time to thaw it, you’ll save money in the process.</li>
 	<li>Try affordable turkey alternatives – If you only have a few guests, Cornish hens or a chicken should suffice while cutting costs and reducing waste.</li>
 	<li>Look for free turkeys at local stores – You may snag one at no cost if you spend a certain amount.</li>
 	<li>Turn loyalty points into a complimentary turkey – Do you have loads of store points saved up? Cash them in and see if they’ll result in a free turkey.</li>
</ul>","Want to avoid sticker shock at the store when shopping for Thanksgiving food? These surprisingly simple tips can make it happen.

703,"Have You Been Tricked Into Black Friday And Cyber Monday Debt?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The joy many people feel from snagging Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals usually doesn’t last long. It either ends within minutes of the purchase due to buyer’s remorse, or it disappears once that credit card bill arrives.

Yes, these annual shopping holidays can offer some affordable discounts on items you may have needed for a while, like an upgraded TV or even a smart home product. But there’s also a lot of “fluff” that comes with them too that comes in the form of mind tricks from retailers.

People with miles of marketing experience are tasked with getting you to spend. And they use the tricks in this article to achieve that goal.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Should you only watch for these manipulative moves on Black Friday and Cyber Monday? No, as they tend to appear throughout the year.

By knowing what to look for, you can avoid overspending. And if you overdid it this year, at least you know that next year can be different so you can keep deep debt at bay.

<h3>Online Upsells</h3>
Shopping on the Internet is undoubtedly convenient, as it lets you buy things without leaving the comfort of your couch. It can lead to overspending, though, and that’s not just on Cyber Monday.

Online upsells are always present on websites whose owners know how to make money. An upsell usually comes in the form of a special offer you can take advantage of when checking out.

For instance, let’s say you’re buying a mattress online. The store may offer you a “one-time-only” offer of sheets for that mattress at a deep discount during the checkout process.

Since sheets go well with mattresses and you may need them, presenting such an upsell makes sense for the store. And since it looks like a substantial discount and you already have your credit card out, you may be highly likely to take the bait.

Are upsells bad? Not necessarily, but they can be if you’re trying to keep your spending under control. By knowing the psychology behind an online upsell, you can avoid the temptation to give in.

Depending on the store, you may get hit with a barrage of them before or after checkout, so keep your eyes peeled for this clever trick.

<h3>Expert Product Placement</h3>
When you walk into a store or visit a website, the retailer probably won’t hit you with their most expensive products first. Instead, they’ll catch your eye with something super-cheap, useful, or entertaining to trigger that itch to spend.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

As soon as you give in to this trick, your mind will be more open to purchasing more expensive things. By breaking the ice in this way, the retailer makes you more susceptible to a shopping spree, when all you really wanted was something specific.

You can combat such product placement by making a list and sticking to it. Shopping this way may not be as fun, it won’t lead to money-related regrets later.

<h3>Fake Pricing</h3>
Don’t pay so much attention to the original price of products. Many are artificially inflated to give you the illusion that you’re getting a mega discount.

While this is particularly common on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, don’t let your guard down. Some retailers place fake prices on items during every month of the year.","If you skipped out on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can breathe a sigh of debt-free relief.

Being restricted to a holiday budget has the benefit of controlling your spending. When you don’t spend wads of cash during the holidays, you can breathe easier throughout the year.

Unfortunately, a small holiday budget can stress some people out to the point that shopping loses its luster. It’s a lot different than walking into the store with a collection of credit cards that give you thousands in purchasing power. By being different, however, a budget won’t leave you with credit card bills that you’ll probably be paying well into next year.

Now that you see the most prominent advantage a budget provides, it’s time to see how to make the most of yours. Follow these simple tips to save, and you’ll find that your budget isn’t so bad after all.

<h3>1. Give your free gifts to others.</h3>
Many stores offer free gifts when you make a purchase, especially when they’re items like makeup, perfume, or cologne.

For instance, you may buy a bottle of perfume and get a bottle of moisturizer for free. While that moisturizer may not be your main gift for someone, it can be part of a gift. You can then buy them something cheaper as their main gift, which saves you money in the process.

<h3>2. Regift what you receive to others.</h3>
This may not be a popular move, but you can regift items you receive to others to cut costs.

If you received something you won’t use from a coworker, for instance, you could give it to someone else on your list without spending a penny.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Get cash back on your purchases.</h3>
Several apps make it super-simple to save during every single month of the year. Use them during the holidays, and you may see even more savings than usual.

As an example, add Rakuten to your Chrome browser. As you shop, you can earn cash back plus find coupon codes to double your savings with hardly any work involved.

Honey is a similar browser extension that acts as a virtual assistant for savings. There’s no need to search for coupon codes or the best deals, as Honey will do it for you once it’s added as a Chrome extension.

<h3>4. Skip the lines and enjoy free shipping instead.</h3>
Unless you love the holiday rush at shopping malls and stores, make your purchases online to save on gas. In addition, you can save on shipping since many sites will offer it as a bonus.

Some websites may require a minimum purchase for free shipping. Keep this in mind before you shop if you plan on making small purchases. If that particular store charges you to ship it to your door, you may be better-served shopping elsewhere.

<h3>5. Make your own gifts.</h3>
You pay a hefty premium for gifts assembled by manufacturers. If you enjoy working with your hands, you can make your own gifts for a fraction of the cost.

A quick search online will lead you to many do-it-yourself gift ideas. By taking the time to make something original, the person who receives it will know that you really care.

<h3>6. Find free events.</h3>
The holidays are loaded with free events that won’t cost you a thing. Find them locally, and you won’t spend so much on end-of-year entertainment.","Is your holiday budget smaller than you’d like? Here are a few hacks that can help you make the most of it without having to cut anyone off your list.

Here are four of the weirder ones you’ll come across that are still 100 percent legitimate.

Making cash from your couch certainly has a beautiful ring to it, which is why online gigs have exploded in popularity over the years. While filling out surveys is one gig you might be familiar with, here is a list of four that you’ve probably never heard of.

<h3>Share Your Purchases, Get Paid</h3>
Do you like sharing your purchases with friends in person or via social media? Share them with the National Consumer Panel, and you can get paid.

If you’ve heard of the Nielsen TV ratings, this is somewhat similar and tied to the company. Instead of sharing your watching habits, though, you share your buying habits.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Once you have the NPCMobile app, you can start scanning the barcodes on items you buy. In exchange, you’ll get points to redeem toys, electronics, household products, gift cards, and more.

As you participate, you can also enter into sweepstakes that have new cars and vacations among their grand prizes.

<h3>Convert Your Phone’s Pics into Payment</h3>
Does your cell phone get a workout from taking so many pictures? If so, you can turn that hobby into income with the Foap app.

Brands and agencies are always looking for photos to promote their products. If you’re particularly good at snapping them on your cell phone, you can sell them for a profit. Foap will split the proceeds with you 50/50.

For example, if someone wants to buy one of your pictures for $10, you’ll make $5. Sell enough images, and you can convert your smartphone into a mini moneymaking machine.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Each photo can be sold multiple times. The more pics you post, the more opportunities you have to sell and earn.

<h3>Watch Videos, Play Games, Make Money</h3>
Who doesn’t love to watch fun videos online? Instead of using that Internet pastime to unwind, you can use it to get paid via MyPoints.

With MyPoints, you get paid for your opinion. Choose from a variety of tasks, perform them, and you’ll earn points that can be converted to gift cards or PayPal Cash.

Besides watching videos, you can play games, read emails, and even shop to earn via MyPoints.

In short, you can put money in your pocket by playing around online, which sure beats having to work hours at a second job.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Make Bucks by Becoming an eJuror</h3>
Jury duty is something most of us would like to avoid, but becoming an eJuror is a different story. Why? Because you can get paid for it. And you can do it without having to leave your home or miss work if you’re currently employed.

How much can you make via eJury? Not a ton, as the payout is around $5 to $10 per case via PayPal. Still, if you do just one per week, you could use this easy gig to put money towards bills or groceries.

Beyond the profiting aspect, being an eJuror can be entertaining as well since you get to take part in actual cases before they go to trial.","A regular 9-to-5 isn’t the only way to make income, as the Internet has several avenues to help you stack cash.

715,"How To Get The Most Bang For Your Buck At The Grocery Store","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

There are plenty of ways to pay less for your food. The problem is, most of us don’t know they exist.

What do we often rely on instead? Coupons, and while they can secure some savings, there are many other ways to achieve that same end goal. Here they are:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>If It’s Prepped, Don’t Put It in Your Basket</h3>
You can make shopping at the grocery store super simple by making it your goal only to buy whole foods.

What’s the purpose of this? To avoid all of the added labor and convenience costs tossed into prepared foods.

For instance, let’s say you’re craving some fresh pineapple. Buying it in nicely chopped chunks may sound tempting, but you’ll pay a premium for being able to eat it in finished form.

Buy the pineapple whole, and you’ll still get all of those juicy chunks once you chop it yourself. And that holds for other forms of produce, cold sandwiches, and foods prepared so you can grab them on the go.

Is it okay to purchase prepared foods when you’re short on time? Sure, just know that making it a habit can get quite costly.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>Choose Frozen Over Fresh</h3>
While frozen foods may not sound as delicious as their fresh counterparts, you’ll enjoy them more once you start cutting costs.

Seafood, for example, ships to the store frozen. What do they do to make that fish “fresh”? They thaw it, and you can do the same at home by buying it frozen, paying less, and still enjoying that same great flavor.

Frozen produce can save you plenty of cash, too, while adding the benefit of a longer life in your kitchen.

Buy frozen, and you won’t have to worry about wasting fresh produce and other foods once they go bad. Instead, you can set out what you plan to eat, freeze the rest, and save it for a rainy day while keeping those costs down.

<h3>Cut Your Meat Costs</h3>
Want an easy way to save 25 percent or more on your meat costs? Only buy items that are on sale. And there’s always something on sale if you look closely enough.

Another quick tip to get the most bang for your meaty buck is to opt for lean cuts of meat. The leaner it is, the less fat. In other words, you’ll only be paying for the good stuff, and not fatty fillers that only add weight to your purchase (and possibly your waistline).

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Go Local</h3>
Do you always drive by a farmer’s market, but never stop to check it out? The next time you see it, stop and look at what they have to offer.

Not only will you notice high-quality produce and other foods at local stands and farmer’s markets, but you should also see lower prices than large grocery stores.

<h3>Save 25 Percent by Shopping Store Brands</h3>
Does your go-to grocery store have its own line of products? It probably does, and many of them will taste just as good as more expensive brand names.

By making this simple switch to the store brand, you can knock 25 percent or more off the price of the products you put in your cart.","Do you feel like you pay more than you should when shopping for groceries?

When it comes to everyday life, clothing is not optional. Unfortunately, you may wish it was if you barely have anything in the bank to buy a wardrobe.

While it may not be as fun as purchasing new threads at the mall, you can get free clothing online via several sources. In doing so, you’ll be able to save cash for other living expenses.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Craigslist</h3>
If there’s no room to budge in your budget, you’re going to want to bookmark the Craigslist free section. Yes, you can use it to find free clothing for you and your entire family, but it offers much more than that.

Just a quick look at the local free section brings up the following mix of complimentary stuff:
<ul>
 	<li>Office chair</li>
 	<li>Puppy</li>
 	<li>Antique wooden table</li>
 	<li>Queen bed</li>
 	<li>Desk with matching bookcase</li>
 	<li>Humidifier</li>
 	<li>Piano</li>
 	<li>Sofa</li>
 	<li>Entertainment center</li>
</ul>
As you can see, you can not only find outfits via Craiglist’s free section, but you can also use it to outfit your entire home.

If you already have everything you need but have a bit of storage space, here’s a money-making hack worth noting: Get free stuff of Craigslist and sell it for a profit. You can then use that to buy brand new clothes.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>2. Nextdoor</h3>
This handy website or app is the perfect tool for staying connected to your community. Visit its classified section and look for free items, and you’re bound to run into some clothing, among other things.

Beyond free clothing and other no-cost items, Nextdoor is also great for getting in touch with people near you who can give you advice.

[related_posts post=723 limit=5]<!-- Related Post-->


For instance, let’s say you need help with cutting childcare costs. Someone on the app can probably point you in the direction of a low-cost babysitter.

Or maybe you have a baby on the way and seek advice on where to find free diapers and wipes. A ""Nextdoor"" neighbor could give you some insider tips there too, such as which local church or charity provides such services.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>3. Facebook</h3>
You may use Facebook to stay in touch with friends and entertain yourself. But did you know you can use it to find free stuff too? You sure can, and there are a couple of ways to do it.

First, you can look for Facebook Groups in your area that carry a common interest or need.

For example, you may be a single mom looking to touch base with people in similar situations in your city. Look for a single mom group in your town, and you could find just that.

Once in a Facebook group, you can make a post stating that you need free clothing for your kids because you lost your job, just went through a divorce, etc. If the right person sees it, they can give you the complimentary clothing you need.

Beyond groups, the Facebook Marketplace offers another avenue to find free clothing. Do a search for free clothes, and you may find someone looking to unload their outfits at no cost.","There’s plenty of free clothing to be had, as long as you know where to look for it online.

One of the best ways to free up more money in your monthly budget is to use coupons. They can give you discounts on things you need, allowing you to grow your bottom line with a minimal amount of work.

While you’re probably familiar with standard coupons found in newspapers or online, you may not know how to get free product coupons that can save you even more.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Do you have to be part of some exclusive club to get access to these super money-savers? Not necessarily. You just have to follow the tips that we’re about to discuss in this article, and you’ll be good to go.

<h3>1. Become a word-of-mouth agent.</h3>
Word-of-mouth advertising has always been a powerful way to help businesses expand their reach minus massive marketing costs. Thanks to the Internet, however, this form of advertising has become even stronger.

If you’re active on social media, you could transform that part of your life into free products from big brands. Do you need to be a celebrity to become an influencer? No, but the bigger your following, the more opportunities you’ll get to snag freebies as companies try to use your influence to grow theirs.

One site you can sign up on to get big brand freebies is BzzAgent. All you have to do is tell them your interests, and they’ll send you products to give feedback on and share with the world.

The list of popular brands BzzAgent connects with is quite impressive and includes:

 	<li>Hershey’s</li>
 	<li>Nestle</li>
 	<li>Gillette</li>
 	<li>L’Oreal</li>
 	<li>Samsonite</li>

<h3>2. Redeem rebates.</h3>
You can get money back when shopping plus freebies via rebates. Here are some places where you can find them:
<ul>
 	<li>Apps like Ibotta or SavingStarOfficial store websites</li>
 	<li>Store advertisements</li>
 	<li>Manufacturer websites</li>
 	<li>In-store displays</li>
 	<li>Coupons in your local Sunday newspaper</li>
 	<li>In product packaging</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Talk to the brand.</h3>
Did you know that brands pay big bucks for feedback? Of course, they do, and it’s because feedback is what helps them make better products and build their reputation.

If you contact a brand directly, the time spent doing so could result in free products. Think of it as a thank you from the company for giving them feedback and advice.

Do you have to be positive when mentioning the brand or product? Not really, as many see any feedback as valuable in helping them improve their products.

When planning this approach, don’t just contact one company. Make a full list of products you frequently use and know well. Then make it your goal to pump out quick reviews for each so you can send them off and see surprises in the mail.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>4. Show some Facebook love.</h3>
Most large brands have a significant social media presence. Follow them on Facebook, for example, and you could earn chances at free products by doing nothing more than hitting the Like button.

To find such opportunities, make a Google Alert for “Facebook freebie.” Whenever a company ignites such a deal, you’ll be one of the first to know via email. You can then participate to get your freebies with ease.","What’s better than regular coupons?

The cost of owning or even renting housing can be too high for a family that’s living on a limited income. To help make the cost of housing more affordable, the government offers housing grants on the federal or state level that provide funding to those who need it most.

If you’re having money issues related to your family’s living situation, keep reading to see how a housing grant can save the day.
<h4>What Is a Housing Grant?</h4>
A housing grant gives low-income families another option to pay for their homes. It can come in handy if they’ve been rejected by a bank for a loan, have a poor credit history, or cannot come up with the money they need to keep a roof over their head.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Eligibility for Housing Grants</h4>
Are low-income families the only groups eligible to receive housing grants? No, as the government has a wide variety of programs to help others.

For instance, there are grants for minorities, women, or even families who have low to moderate-income, among others.

If you’re looking to buy your first home, you’ll be glad to know that many grants exist solely for first-time homebuyers.

If you have no credit, poor credit, or a financial past filled with mistakes, don’t be discouraged. Grants do not base eligibility on your credit score, as they aren’t set up like bank loans. You can also be married, single, or married with children.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Where to Find Housing Grants</h4>
To see which grants the federal government has to offer, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website.

As you browse the HUD’s site, you can see information on the various programs that exist, descriptions of who they serve, and how much funding is available per year.

Since this information is always changing, it’s best to check the site periodically.
<h4>The Main Benefit of a Housing Grant</h4>
While some government programs may offer low-interest loans or help families with down payments on homes, a grant is even better.

Unlike a loan, you do not have to pay a grant back. In short, it’s free money as long as you adhere to the corresponding rules and eligibility requirements.

Since getting a housing grant equals free money, it can truly be an event that could change your family’s future for generations to come.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>What Can a Housing Grant Be Used For?</h4>
Housing grants vary significantly in terms of who is eligible for them, where they can be used, and what they can be used for.

Some grants can be used for apartments in urban areas, while others can be used for new homes in rural settings. Some can be used for mobile homes, while others can be used to buy commercial property or land, and so on.

If you’re at risk of foreclosure, a housing grant can help you save your home. And if you want to renovate an existing property, a grant can help there too.

Since the list of grants is so massive and diverse, your best bet is once again to check the HUD’s website to see what’s available.","Do you need financial help when it comes to housing? See how government grants can help low-income families and others with a variety of home-related issues.

811,"5 Questions To Ask Yourself When Searching For Online Freebies","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Have you been a victim of fraudulent charges on your credit card or, even worse, identity theft? If not, then consider yourself lucky. And to keep it from happening in the future, you’ll need to be extra careful when hunting for freebies online.

Scammers use free offers to lure in people seeking no-cost bargains. If a person bites, the scammer can sell their stolen info, run up charges on their credit card, or steal their identity to make their life a living hell.

To keep such unfortunate events from happening to you, here are some questions you should ask yourself before submitting any info for a freebie you find online:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. “Is this really free?”</h4>
As its name suggests, a freebie should be free. In other words, it should have no cost attached to it.

As such, you shouldn’t have to pay anything upfront, like a processing fee, to receive it. You also shouldn’t have to pay anything in the future, which makes a request for your payment info a huge red flag.

If the answer to this question is no, it’s time to find a better, more legitimate online freebie that’s worth your time.
<h4>2. “Is it too good to be true?”</h4>
Don’t fill out a form offering you a free car or house. The same holds true with any offers for gift cards in large amounts.

Nobody is going to give you something like that with nothing in return. Give them your info, though, and they will give you a headache via excessive solicitation, charges to your card, or identity theft.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. “Am I comfortable with all of these questions?”</h4>
Some freebie offers will ask you questions because the company wants feedback or insight into their potential customers. This can help their marketing efforts.

Still, even though this is a legitimate reason to ask questions, you may not want to reveal all of your answers.

If you feel like questions are too personal or there’s info you don’t want to disclose, leave the freebie alone. Your peace of mind is worth more than some no-cost product that could lead to paranoia down the line.

Even if one question triggers your internal alarm, don’t hesitate to move on. And if two pieces of info should trigger anyone’s alarm, it’s requests to know your credit card information or your Social Security number.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. “Is this website trustworthy?”</h4>
Getting a freebie from a retail giant like Walmart should put you in the safe zone, as they have the resources to do so. The same holds for small local businesses with solid reputations.

If you’ve never heard of a site, however, stay away. The last thing you want to have happen is to have your information stolen.

To be extra safe, you could search for the website in question online. Look for any comments on its legitimacy. If you see people saying that it’s a scam, don’t touch it.
<h4>5. “Is it worth it?”</h4>
When in doubt, always trust your gut. If you feel unsure about something or don’t think the freebie is worth your trouble, don’t be afraid to leave it alone. Just because it’s free doesn’t mean you have to have it.","There’s no shortage of free stuff on the Internet. To keep yourself safe, however, you must ask yourself some questions, so that promise of a freebie doesn’t lead to lost money or stolen personal info.","2020-02-20 17:47:32",post,https://mammothawards.com/5-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-searching-for-online-freebies/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,shutterstock_712290157.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,273,shutterstock_712290157,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,"Financial Help","Quick Money",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,5-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-searching-for-online-freebies,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 18:19:13"
867,"3 iOS Apps to Reduce Repair Costs and Keep Your Car Running","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Emergency expenses can wreak instant havoc on any family’s finances. While unexpected medical bills may take the cake when it comes to causing bankruptcy, car repair bills can cause plenty of trouble too.

Luckily, you can use three apps on your iPhone or iPad to prevent those repairs from ever being needed, all of which have free versions that you can try.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Track Your Car’s Fuel Economy via Fuelly</h4>
Filling up at the gas station is an unavoidable expense. You can reduce it, though, as long as you keep an eye on how efficiently your vehicle is using that gas.

This may sound like something only an engineer or mechanic could do, but you can do it too thanks to the Fuelly app.

As its name suggests, Fuelly is all about fuel. It lets you track fuel efficiency, how much you’ve spent on gas, your best and most recent MPG, and more. In short, it gives you an overhead view of how efficient your car is, and whether or not you can increase that efficiency through preventative maintenance.

What type of maintenance can maximize your fuel efficiency? Simple tasks like getting routine oil changes and tire rotations. Fuelly allows you to stay on top of such tasks by letting you set scheduled reminders for when a trip to the shop is in order.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>Use Drivvo to Never Miss Maintenance</h4>
Your car is equipped with hundreds of parts that help you get from point A to point B. It’s impossible to remember every single bit of maintenance that’s needed to prevent costly repairs. As long as you have Drivvo, though, you don’t have to remember a thing.

Whether it’s when your next oil change is due or where you had your car serviced last, Drivvo will store all of your pertinent info. Scheduled reminders will tell you when it’s time for maintenance, and they’ll even tell you when your next car payment is due.

Besides acting like an assistant who reminds you of important events related to your car, Drivvo acts like a finance manager as well. It has detailed charts on car-related costs, which can come in handy when tax season rolls around.

As if that wasn’t enough, Drivvo will even tell you where the cheapest gas is in your area so that you can save even more pennies at the pump.

<h4>Get Repair Cost Estimates with myCARFAX</h4>
You may be familiar with CARFAX if you’ve recently purchased a car. It’s a service that lets you see a car’s accident history and more so you can make an informed buying decision. With the myCARFAX app, however, you can ensure your car’s resale value stays high by maintaining it properly.

You get scheduled reminders for oil changes, tire rotation, safety/emission inspections, and more with the myCARFAX app. Those alone are worth the download so you don’t miss a thing, but it can also save you money when repairs arise by letting you compare costs.

Need some transmission work? Let myCARFAX find the repair shop near you with the most affordable quotes.

Last, but not least, myCARFAX can keep you safe by alerting you to any open recalls for your vehicle. This is info you may never discover, which makes the app a must for keeping your family safe and your automobile investment protected.","Regularly scheduled maintenance can keep your car running in tip-top shape so you can avoid costly repairs.

871,"A One-Minute Guide to Understanding Your Credit Score","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

How important are those three digits that make up your credit score? Extremely important if you want to save money during your lifetime.

You’ll need good credit to become eligible for a mortgage to buy your dream home. You’ll also need it to secure credit cards with low interest rates and favorable auto loans. To have a good credit score, however, you need to understand how the system works. We’ll discuss just that in this quick guide.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>What Is a Good Credit Score?</h4>
Your credit score can run from anywhere between 300 to 850. A credit score that is 579 or lower is considered poor. A fair credit score ranges from 580 to 669. Once you sit in the 670 to 739 range, your score is considered to be good. 740 to 799 is very good, while the uppermost range of 800 to 850 is excellent.

What’s the good news if your credit score is currently low? You can always raise it.
<h4>The Five Basic Components of a Credit Score</h4>
Your credit score is calculated by considering five factors. The first fact is payment history, which makes up 35 percent of your score. Pay your bills on time to keep your payment history pristine, since any mistakes here can negatively affect your score for years.

The second credit score component is credit utilization. It makes up 30 percent of your score and describes the amount of your available credit you actually use. To calculate your credit utilization ratio, divide what you owe on your cards by the total limit on them.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

For example, let’s say you have one credit card. It has a limit of $2,000, and you’ve spent $1,000 of that so far. Your credit utilization ratio for this card is 50 percent.

Ideally, your credit utilization ratio should be 30 percent or lower. The lower your ratio, the higher your credit score. In short, maxing out your credit cards is a move that should be avoided.

You can lower this ratio by either paying your balances on time to reduce what you owe, or by increasing your available credit. Doing both can boost your credit score faster.

The third factor that determines your credit score is the length of credit history, which makes up 15 percent of your score. The lengthier it is, the better, since it gives creditors more to look at in terms of your behavior as a borrower.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

New credit is the fourth credit score factor. To keep your score from dropping, avoid getting several new credit cards at the same time.

The fifth and final factor that affects your credit score is credit mix. It accounts for the last 10 percent of your score.

How can you make your credit mix look better to boost your score? Take out a personal loan, for example, that contrasts a bit from a conventional credit card.

While this could improve your credit mix, proceed with caution. A personal loan comes with a cost, and it may not impact your score enough to warrant getting one.","Knowing your credit score can help you figure out where you stand when it comes to borrowing power. Knowing what your credit score means can help you figure out how to fix it.","2020-03-02 19:00:44",post,https://mammothawards.com/a-one-minute-guide-to-understanding-your-credit-score/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_420069268.jpg,shutterstock_420069268.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_420069268.jpg,207,shutterstock_420069268,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_420069268.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,a-one-minute-guide-to-understanding-your-credit-score,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 18:19:12"
877,"This Facebook Hack Could Kickstart Your Online Gig Career","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Working online is an entirely legitimate way to make money nowadays. Depending on how good you get, you could start making a ton of money from your couch.

While online work may get a bad rap, it’s much more than just doing scores of surveys to snag a couple of cents. Instead, you can now get Internet gigs from clients that will pay you to:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<ul>
 	<li>Write articles and emails</li>
 	<li>Design logos</li>
 	<li>Proofread text</li>
 	<li>Translate</li>
 	<li>Do voice work</li>
 	<li>Transcribe audio into text</li>
 	<li>Create videos</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
Although that list is a bit long, it’s just a tiny fraction of online work that’s available. Unfortunately, you will run into competition in your quest to land Internet gigs, since it’s an arena that’s open to the entire world.

That competition can be particularly stiff if you have no online experience and your resume is lacking. But don’t fret, we’ll teach you a little hack that can help you get that first gig, and many more after that.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>How to Use Facebook to Get Your First Online Gig</h4>
For this article, let’s say you use Photoshop as a hobby, and you’d like to make money designing logos for people and businesses. You’re pretty good at it, but you’ve never had an official client, so your paid portfolio is lacking.

This lack of a portfolio can make it hard to stand out on sites like Fiverr or Upwork. Many clients will visit those and other freelance sites to find people to complete tasks in exchange for payment. But they’ll often pay more attention to profiles with reviews or extensive history.

Instead of making a profile on such sites and waiting forever for your first paying fish to bite, go on Facebook to get noticed.

First, look at your friends list. Do you notice any business owners on there? You can message them offering to create a logo or some other design for free in exchange for a testimonial.

Will they say no? Probably not, since it’s free. And if you do a good job, you could get paid handsomely or get future work or referrals from them.

You could use a screenshot of their testimonial as a profile pic on a freelance site. Or, if that first client wants future work, ask them to hire you via the website you desire to get that track record going.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Why is a track record on sites like Fiverr or Upwork important? It builds trust with clients who don’t know you, and it gives you a solid reputation that will make it more likely to get hired.
<h4>How to Use Facebook Groups to Land Gigs</h4>
Besides using your friends list, you can use Facebook in another way to get clients via Groups.

Facebook Groups are great since they bring people with similar interests and needs together. By making a post in a group regarding your free offer for logo design, you could attract many interested parties at once.

What type of Group should you target to solicit your service? If it’s a logo, aim for groups where entrepreneurs gather.

Whether they’re starting local small businesses or online ones, they’ll need a logo. Instead of paying for one, they’ll gladly take your offer for a free design, and give you that much-needed testimonial to get your gig career going.

Before you post in any group, be sure to read the rules. Some may not allow you to post anything offering services. Others, meanwhile, will allow you to introduce your services on certain days.

You can skate around strict posting rules by engaging with others on their posts too. If someone makes a post asking for recommendations on logo design, pop in and give your offer. Or, to be super stealth, message the person privately.

The point is to make contact with people who need your service. Offer the first one for free, get that testimonial, and get on the fast track towards online cash.","Getting your first online gig can be tough if nobody knows you.

907,"Free Netflix? Here’s How","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Streaming movies and TV shows via Netflix is a great way to cut the cord so you can <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/save-time-and-money-by-getting-groceries-delivered-to-your-door/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">minimize your monthly expenses</a>. Just add a low-cost HD antenna to your TV for free local channels, and you can eliminate your cable bill.

Even though Netflix (depending on the plan) can only end up costing around $15 per month, this still may be too much for your budget.

Here are ways to greatly reduce that subscription fee or make it 100 percent free.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>Make the Most out of Free Trials</h4>
If you’ve never had a Netflix subscription before, you can get a free trial for a month to see what all the hype is about. As long as you cancel before that month is over, your credit card won’t be charged.

What happens if you never get a paid subscription? To gain you as a customer, Netflix will usually send out an offer email a few months later.

What will this email have? You guessed it – another free trial offer.

Depending on how many people are in your home, you could use this free trial hack to get several months of Netflix for free. You will need different credit cards, however.

You can get around this if any issues arise by either getting a virtual credit card number from your company or by buying Visa gift cards.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>Share With Someone Else</h4>
Since Netflix is so popular, there’s a good chance that a friend or a family member has an account. If they have the plan that lets them watch on four screens simultaneously, you can be one of those viewers for free.

Don’t request the Netflix ID and password from somebody you barely know. They probably won’t give it to you and may even scoff in the process. Instead, get it from a person who you’ve known for a long time and trusts you enough to hand over this information.

[related_posts post=907 limit=5]<!-- Related Post-->


To avoid filling their account with shows and movies they don’t like, make a separate profile that can hold your preferences. As long as you use it and not anybody else’s different households can share that account without worry.
<h4>Do a Group Buy</h4>
Similar to that first hack, you can do a group buy with other people to share the cost of a Netflix account.

Since it rounds out to around $15 a month, you can easily split that amongst four people to get tons of entertainment for a little over 10 cents per day.

If nobody you know is willing to go in on this group buy, you may want to head over to eBay to try something similar.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Some people sell Netflix accounts on eBay on the cheap. How do they do it? By signing up for free trials over and over again and reselling them via the site.

To ensure you get a trustworthy account, make sure the seller has been selling for over a year, and has positive feedback.

As for what type of savings you can snag, some sellers offer 12-month premium subscriptions for as little as $30.","If Netflix’s monthly cost has been holding you back, here are hacks to help you overcome that obstacle by getting it for free.

913,"Check Out These Low-Cost Alternatives To Highly-Overpriced Products","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you know how much some products’ prices were marked-up, you may never repurchase them.

Here are some products with notoriously high mark-ups, plus their lower-cost alternatives.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>Coffee</h4>
You may buy your daily cup of joe from the coffee shop for convenience. You surely don’t buy it from them for cost, because if so, you’re grossly overpaying.

A large coffee from a famous shop could cost as much as $4 when you add in all the fixings. Make it at home, and it could cost less than ten cents per cup.

Will you need to make some initial investments to brew low-cost coffee at home? Sure, since you’ll need to buy a coffee maker, the actual coffee, sugar, milk, and any other additions.

Still, you’ll come out on top and save money in the long run, and you won’t have to wait in long lines anymore either.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>Prescription Drugs</h4>
You may have certain medical conditions that make prescriptions an expense you cannot eliminate. You could lower that expense, however, which is excellent news if you’ve been paying a premium for name-brand prescriptions.

When you buy a drug from a big-name manufacturer, you’re not just paying for its ingredients that help you feel better. Instead, you’re also paying for all of the marketing costs involved with their advertisements, development costs, sales commissions, and more.

If you want an example, look at Prozac. This popular antidepressant can sell for $136 per bottle. Get the generic version called fluoxetine HCL, however, and you can pay as little as $3.
<h4>Why do doctors prescribe the name-brand versions?</h4>
They figure that your insurance will pay for the high cost.
They’re familiar with the name since they had a pharmaceutical sales rep pitch it in their office.

You can avoid paying more than you should by simply asking your doctor for the drug’s generic version when writing your prescription. This is especially helpful if you have a high deductible.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>Bottled Water</h4>
Buying bottled water at the store or gas station may seem convenient when you’re on the go. And while such water is undoubtedly the healthiest drink you can have, you’re probably paying too much for it.

Instead of buying bottled water, purchase a reusable bottle, and fill it up with tap water. Due to the Safe Water Drinking Act, tap water is labeled as legal for human consumption as long as it doesn’t come from a private well.

If the idea of taking water straight from the tap doesn’t tickle your fancy, buy a filter for that added peace of mind. It’ll cost you a bit up front, but you’ll save loads in the long term.
<h4>Printer Ink</h4>
Do you ever wonder why printer ink is so expensive? Some of it has to do with the fact that manufacturers typically sell printers at a loss.

How do they make up that lost money? By charging a ton for the ink you’ll need to make that printer useful.

Instead of buying brand new ink cartridges, buy ones that are refilled via the Costco Photo Center or online. You can save around 50 percent off the regular price of printer ink by using this method.","Some products you frequently need are probably highly overpriced.

916,"6 Factors That Can Lead To Cheaper Car Insurance","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As much as a pain as it may be to toss your hard-earned cash towards car insurance every month, it’s a necessity.

While you can’t legally avoid paying car insurance, there are ways to lower your premium so it makes less of a dent in your budget. Some are linked to the type of car you own, while others take some more personal factors into account.

Here are some factors that go into calculating how much you pay, plus how you can lower it:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>1. Your credit score</h4>
Want a good reason to make payments on time so you can enjoy a higher credit score? Doing so can lower your car insurance premium.
<h4>2. The size of your car</h4>
The bigger the car, the lower your premium can be. This is because many larger cars are safer in accidents than their smaller counterparts.

Keep this in mind when car shopping. You may want to go bigger next time.

[related_posts post=916 limit=5]<!-- Related Post-->

While all cars are not created equal when it comes to safety ratings, pure physics come into play here. Even a smaller car with a high safety rating may cost more to insure than a bigger one with a lower score.

Don’t think that a bigger engine makes a car “larger,” either. In fact, the bigger the engine and the smaller the car, the more you’ll pay. That’s why some sports cars are so expensive in the insurance department.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->
<h4>3. The age of your car</h4>
Newer cars are less likely to be “totaled” in an accident. Older cars, however, may cost more to repair than they’re worth, which leads to more frequent totaling.

What does this translate to? The newer the car, the higher its collision coverage rates, and the higher the premium.

If you have an old car that isn’t worth much, you may want to get rid of your collision coverage and put it towards a replacement instead.
<h4>4. Your car’s safety rating</h4>
Yes, bigger cars are often considered safer in accidents, which can lead to lower premiums than smaller cars. When comparing vehicles of the same size, however, their safety ratings can make a difference in insurance premiums.

Safer cars are more likely to protect the driver and passengers in an accident, resulting in lower medical bills. For this reason, cars with high safety ratings can have lower premiums.

What can increase a car’s safety rating? Features like airbags, traction control, automatic seat belts, and the like.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>5. How attractive your car is to thieves</h4>
If your car is on the most stolen list, that will increase the premium. You can combat this by installing anti-theft features like a car alarm or a GPS tracking device.
<h4>6. How often you drive your car</h4>
The more your car is on the road, the higher its risk of getting into an accident. When getting an auto insurance quote, be sure to know how much you really drive.

Don’t overestimate your miles driven. Doing so can raise your rate.

Lastly, if you have a garage, be sure to mention it. Keeping a car safely in a garage limits potential damage and can decrease your premium too.","Want to pay less for car insurance every month?

4719,"How Housing Grants Help Low-Income Families","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The cost of owning or even renting housing can be too high for a family that’s living on a limited income. To help make the cost of housing more affordable, the government offers housing grants on the federal or state level that provide funding to those who need it most.

If you’re having money issues related to your family’s living situation, keep reading to see how a housing grant can save the day.
<h4>What Is a Housing Grant?</h4>
A housing grant gives low-income families another option to pay for their homes. It can come in handy if they’ve been rejected by a bank for a loan, have a poor credit history, or cannot come up with the money they need to keep a roof over their head.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Eligibility for Housing Grants</h4>
Are low-income families the only groups eligible to receive housing grants? No, as the government has a wide variety of programs to help others.

For instance, there are grants for minorities, women, or even families who have low to moderate-income, among others.

If you’re looking to buy your first home, you’ll be glad to know that many grants exist solely for first-time homebuyers.

If you have no credit, poor credit, or a financial past filled with mistakes, don’t be discouraged. Grants do not base eligibility on your credit score, as they aren’t set up like bank loans. You can also be married, single, or married with children.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Where to Find Housing Grants</h4>
To see which grants the federal government has to offer, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website.

As you browse the HUD’s site, you can see information on the various programs that exist, descriptions of who they serve, and how much funding is available per year.

Since this information is always changing, it’s best to check the site periodically.
<h4>The Main Benefit of a Housing Grant</h4>
While some government programs may offer low-interest loans or help families with down payments on homes, a grant is even better.

Unlike a loan, you do not have to pay a grant back. In short, it’s free money as long as you adhere to the corresponding rules and eligibility requirements.

Since getting a housing grant equals free money, it can truly be an event that could change your family’s future for generations to come.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>What Can a Housing Grant Be Used For?</h4>
Housing grants vary significantly in terms of who is eligible for them, where they can be used, and what they can be used for.

Some grants can be used for apartments in urban areas, while others can be used for new homes in rural settings. Some can be used for mobile homes, while others can be used to buy commercial property or land, and so on.

If you’re at risk of foreclosure, a housing grant can help you save your home. And if you want to renovate an existing property, a grant can help there too.

Since the list of grants is so massive and diverse, your best bet is once again to check the HUD’s website to see what’s available.","Do you need financial help when it comes to housing? See how government grants can help low-income families and others with a variety of home-related issues.

4720,"5 Questions To Ask Yourself When Searching For Online Freebies","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Have you been a victim of fraudulent charges on your credit card or, even worse, identity theft? If not, then consider yourself lucky. And to keep it from happening in the future, you’ll need to be extra careful when hunting for freebies online.

Scammers use free offers to lure in people seeking no-cost bargains. If a person bites, the scammer can sell their stolen info, run up charges on their credit card, or steal their identity to make their life a living hell.

To keep such unfortunate events from happening to you, here are some questions you should ask yourself before submitting any info for a freebie you find online:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. “Is this really free?”</h4>
As its name suggests, a freebie should be free. In other words, it should have no cost attached to it.

As such, you shouldn’t have to pay anything upfront, like a processing fee, to receive it. You also shouldn’t have to pay anything in the future, which makes a request for your payment info a huge red flag.

If the answer to this question is no, it’s time to find a better, more legitimate online freebie that’s worth your time.
<h4>2. “Is it too good to be true?”</h4>
Don’t fill out a form offering you a free car or house. The same holds true with any offers for gift cards in large amounts.

Nobody is going to give you something like that with nothing in return. Give them your info, though, and they will give you a headache via excessive solicitation, charges to your card, or identity theft.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. “Am I comfortable with all of these questions?”</h4>
Some freebie offers will ask you questions because the company wants feedback or insight into their potential customers. This can help their marketing efforts.

Still, even though this is a legitimate reason to ask questions, you may not want to reveal all of your answers.

If you feel like questions are too personal or there’s info you don’t want to disclose, leave the freebie alone. Your peace of mind is worth more than some no-cost product that could lead to paranoia down the line.

Even if one question triggers your internal alarm, don’t hesitate to move on. And if two pieces of info should trigger anyone’s alarm, it’s requests to know your credit card information or your Social Security number.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. “Is this website trustworthy?”</h4>
Getting a freebie from a retail giant like Walmart should put you in the safe zone, as they have the resources to do so. The same holds for small local businesses with solid reputations.

If you’ve never heard of a site, however, stay away. The last thing you want to have happen is to have your information stolen.

To be extra safe, you could search for the website in question online. Look for any comments on its legitimacy. If you see people saying that it’s a scam, don’t touch it.
<h4>5. “Is it worth it?”</h4>
When in doubt, always trust your gut. If you feel unsure about something or don’t think the freebie is worth your trouble, don’t be afraid to leave it alone. Just because it’s free doesn’t mean you have to have it.","There’s no shortage of free stuff on the Internet. To keep yourself safe, however, you must ask yourself some questions, so that promise of a freebie doesn’t lead to lost money or stolen personal info.","2020-05-18 17:47:32",post,https://mammothawards.com/5-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-searching-for-online-freebies-2/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,shutterstock_712290157.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,273,shutterstock_712290157,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_712290157.jpg,_Uncategorized,,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,5-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-searching-for-online-freebies-2,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 18:19:11"
4721,"5 Money-Saving Tips To Cope With The Coronavirus Scare","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are some tips to help you in case COVID-19 leads to an isolation period where you’re stuck at home.

Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Avoid close contact with others and large groups. Stay at home if you’re sick.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What do all of those tips have in common? They’re suggestions for what to do as COVID-19 spreads across the globe.

While recent news about the coronavirus may lead to worry, it’s something we’ll all have to face. What’s one unfortunate move we may all have to make? Staying at home under quarantine to keep the virus under control.

This possibility has led many to start stocking up on supplies. You should do the same to ensure your family has everything it needs should they have to stay home, while also following these money-saving tips.

Since your budget may get smaller due to COVID-19’s economic impact, saving every penny you can will be a must.
<h4>1. Cut back on spending.</h4>
You may not be eating out as often or hitting the movies, but there are other forms of unnecessary spending that you’ll want to avoid as well.

For instance, the urge to buy every case of toilet paper you see (if you can even find any) may spike. The same holds for hand sanitizer.

As long as you have a sufficient supply, don’t go overboard spending money that should be saved for other necessities like healthcare.

Since we don’t know how long COVID-19 will last, it’s best to be as conservative as possible with your spending, even if it’s on necessities like TP and sanitizer.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Buy food that lasts.</h4>
Don’t buy fresh food in bulk that can spoil soon. Instead, stock up on canned goods that are affordable and have a long shelf life.

Food that can be frozen is a safe bet, but canned is the way to go just in case something causes your electricity to cut off.

Since COVID-19 is a virus, try to buy items that would make you feel better if you get ill, like canned soups.
<h4>3. Go generic.</h4>
Whether it’s canned goods or cough drops and cold medicine, there’s no need to opt for the name brand version if you’re trying to save as much money as possible.

Most large grocery stores have their own generic versions of products that contain the same essential ingredients.

Buy them to enjoy their discounts while also getting the same effect, especially when it comes to drugs like Tylenol or Advil that can charge a premium just for the recognizable name on the label.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Make shopping convenient and as non-contact as possible.</h4>
Some stores like Target, Walmart, and Publix offer curbside pickup. This allows you to shop for what you need online and pick it up without having to walk all over a store where disease could spread.

While you could opt for a food delivery service, curbside pickup is the cheaper option since some (Target and Walmart) are offering it for free. And beyond saving money, it’s also an obvious time-saver, which is huge with so many things on your to-do list.

Do this with your prescriptions too. You can get them delivered to your door, and some pharmacies, such as CVS, are now waiving delivery charges while we still learn more about the coronavirus.
<h4>5. Take advantage of more affordable telemedicine.</h4>
If you start to feel flu-like symptoms or require some other form of medical attention, you could talk to a doctor via phone or video chat to fix the issue. Thanks to telemedicine (telehealth), this is now an option that’s cheaper, safer, and more convenient than an in-person visit.

Since many insurers are waiving testing costs for coronavirus, getting diagnosed via telemedicine from the comfort of your home may be your best bet.","The coronavirus (COVID-19) scare has made many people worry about how they’ll handle it.

4722,"6 Reasons To Get Help With Your Tax Debt Now","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>1. You can get a team of professionals on your side.</h4>
Having to face the IRS alone can be complicated and stressful. By hiring a tax relief firm to help, you’ll have experts from different tax-related backgrounds to give you the guidance you need.

If this is your first time dealing with the IRS, you may not know what your options are when settling tax debt. CPA’s, attorneys, and other tax specialists, however, do know the best ways to deal with such issues, and you can have all of them on your side once you solicit the help of a relief firm.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. You can end up paying less than you owe.</h4>
Unpaid taxes may be just part of what you owe the IRS. Depending on periods involved, you may also owe penalties and interest that can spiral out of control over time.

A tax relief firm can take a look at your situation, see why you owe the debt, and try to have such penalties removed from the equation. In doing so, they make your debt much more manageable.
<h4>3. You can keep your property.</h4>
As a last resort, the IRS sometimes seizes homes and other property to pay tax debts. While it may seem like an extreme measure, it could happen to you if you ignore your debt and don’t find a solution quickly.

If you hire a tax resolution firm, they can negotiate with the IRS to reduce how much you owe so you can pay the debt and keep your property in the process.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>4. You can stop a bank levy.</h4>
Imagine waking up one morning and seeing that your bank account has been cleared out by the IRS. It’s a nightmare that can happen if they impose a bank levy to get a tax debt paid, but luckily, you can avoid it.

Don’t ignore warnings and written notices from the IRS out of fear. The problem will not go away by itself, and it can result in bank levy or property confiscation.

If you can’t tackle the issue on your own, getting a tax resolution firm to help before any severe action happens may be your best bet.
<h4>5. You can stop a wage garnishment.</h4>
While the IRS can take your property or empty your bank account, they may also garnish your wages to resolve tax debt. If they succeed, it could make it impossible for you to pay your monthly bills. This could result in damaging your credit, getting evicted, and more.

Instead of letting a wage garnishment complicate your situation, you may want to see if a tax resolution firm can soften the IRS’ collection efforts while you arrange a way to pay them back.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. You can gain peace of mind.</h4>
Dealing with the IRS can be intimidating. If you’ve reached the point where you're fearful of opening your mailbox every day, now may be the time to resolve your tax issues.

While you may have put it off in the past due to how complicated taxes can be, working with a tax resolution firm may finally give you some much-needed peace of mind so you can move on with your life.","Is your tax debt making it hard to sleep at night?

<h4>Help With Lost Income</h4>
Many businesses have been forced to close to help with social distancing and slow the spread of COVID-19. This has resulted in workers being laid off, furloughed, or losing income via reduced hours.

The federal government recently passed the CARES Act stimulus bill to fund households meeting income requirements. It includes one-time cash payments, extra unemployment assistance, and more.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

There are other ways to find similar assistance too. First, you can look to see what your state’s unemployment policies are. Second, you may find additional information by contacting your state’s public health office.

While lost income through job loss may be your primary issue, you may also know older adults or relatives who’ve been financially impacted by COVID-19 as well. Since the virus tends to affect older patients more severely, quarantines and other safety measures may limit them more than other age groups.

For this reason, doing a separate search for benefits for older adults may be helpful. You can do this by going here and looking for options on the state or local level through the National Council on Aging.
<h4>Help With Paying Your Bills</h4>
Although the coronavirus has made it impossible for some families to pay their bills, the good news is that some companies are freezing payments for the time being. If you have federally-held student loans, for example, you won’t have to make payments until September 30, 2020.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

What if you don’t have federal student loans, though? What if they’re held by a bank? Or what if you have other bills that haven’t been put on hold. What are your options then?

Regardless of the bill, your best bet is to contact the company directly to see what your options are. Some may offer reduced payments or put you on a payment plan to make your bills more manageable.

Others may let you change the payment date or request an extension. Since the coronavirus’s impact is so widespread, you may have a much easier time negotiating than ever before.

Before contacting a company, have some necessary information handy. They may ask what your current financial situation is or how much you can afford to pay. They may also want to know when you’ll be able to start making regular payments once again.

If you’re contacting your mortgage company, you may be asked questions regarding your expenses and income, as well as assets.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Speaking of mortgages and housing, <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/i_want_to/talk_to_a_housing_counselor"">counselors from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)</a> may be able to help you if you’re having trouble paying your loan. And if you can’t afford housing or rent, they may also be able to point you in the right direction for a Section 8 voucher that provides rental assistance.

Lastly, if credit card companies are hounding you for money you don’t have, you can speak with debt collectors to come up with a realistic repayment plan.

If that’s not an option, working with a credit counseling organization or debt settlement company may be your best bet. Stay away from any that ask for an upfront fee.
<h4>Watch for Coronavirus Scams</h4>
Since these are trying times, many scammers have decided to take advantage of people in need. As you search for assistance to help you stay afloat during the COVID-19 outbreak, you’ll need to beware of scams.

There are scams where people are trying to charge others to take tests to see if they have the coronavirus. Fake testing kits are making the rounds as well. You may even run into fake cures that promise to protect you from COVID-19. Another growing scam charges a fee to stop payments on your bills.

Whether it’s via phone calls texts, emails, social media, or websites, stay alert, and don’t disclose any personal information or pay fees that are not warranted.

You can find out more ways to protect yourself from scams by <a href=""https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/02/coronavirus-scammers-follow-headlines"">visiting the Federal Trade Commission’s website</a>.","Has the coronavirus outbreak negatively impacted your finances?

Habitat for Humanity can help you save via a safe, affordable home while providing other benefits as well. Let’s look at them now.
<h4>1. Safe Housing</h4>
Although community volunteers, including the eventual homeowners themselves, work together to build Habitat homes, each is constructed to meet strict safety standards. This is ensured by having professionals nearby to help with each project.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

While Habitat for Humanity homes are safe and sturdy, they also provide safety via neighborhoods where families can grow, and children can prosper.

Statistics show that Habitat homes achieve this goal, as children who grow up in them are twice as likely to attend college than other children with similar social backgrounds.

Some of this can be attributed to stability, as kids who grow up in a community-oriented neighborhood and a stable home won’t have to continually change schools, which can keep them from dropping out.

Additionally, Habitat homes eliminate unclean or hazardous environments that can lead to emotional or behavioral problems.
<h4>2. Affordable Housing</h4>
Despite low income, many families still face an uphill battle with high rents. With Habitat for Humanity, such families can pay affordable mortgages and become homeowners in the process.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Deposits for Habitat for Humanity housing are also lower than local averages, giving homeowners another way to cut costs.

The mortgages and associated costs aren’t the only affordable aspect of Habitat housing, though, as they are also built to be energy-efficient, which can result in lower monthly utility bills.

Combine all of these savings, and it’s no wonder why studies have shown that Habitat homeowners see success when it comes to finally becoming financially independent.
<h4>3. Free Financial Education</h4>
Becoming a homeowner involves much more than paying a mortgage. Habitat for Humanity knows this and supplies its new homeowners with all the education they need to make the most of their home and their money.

Since classes are a mandatory part of becoming a Habitat homeowner, all participants get valuable exposure to material in such topics as budgeting, credit repair, estate planning, maintenance, and more.

Knowledge taken from these classes can then be passed down among generations.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. A Feeling of Accomplishment and Belonging</h4>
Habitat for Humanity requires sweat equity from homeowners. This allows them to own homes, even if they don’t have a lot of savings, by investing time and effort.

Since sweat equity involves things like helping to construct homes, administrative work, classes, etc., homeowners get to actively participate with their community in the home building process.

In the end, this helps them feel like they’ve become part of something special, which can result in feelings of pride and accomplishment.
<h4>5. Quick Equity</h4>
While safe and up to code, Habitat homes are often built efficiently and at very low cost, which can lead to instant equity as soon as you’re handed over the keys.

For instance, your Habitat home may have cost just $100,000 to build. Once it officially hits the housing market, you may notice that it’s worth $150,000. That gives you $50,000 in instant equity.

Can you take advantage of this equity and quickly sell your home for a nice profit? Probably not, as many local Habitat offices may require you to live in the house for a period before selling it.

Still, it’s nice to know that your home is already positively affecting your financial future.

4819,"How To Minimize Section 8 Waiting Times","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Section 8, or the newly-named Housing Choice Voucher program, can help low-income households with rental assistance. Since so many people require such help, demand for the vouchers far exceeds the supply.

What does this translate to? Sitting on a long waiting list that could take months or even years to process your voucher, even after your application is approved.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

While the upcoming tips may not get you a Housing Choice Voucher tomorrow, they can speed up the process so you can get the funding you need sooner.
<h4>1. Make sure your application is accurate.</h4>
Before you can even make the Section 8 waiting list, you’ll have to get approved. And to get approved, you’ll have to make sure you meet the program’s prerequisites, and all of your information is correct and up to date.

One tiny error on your application could lead to a rejection by your local Public Housing Agency (PHA). For this reason, you want to be accurate and take your time while filling out your Section 8 application.

It’s equally important to update any changes in your information too. For instance, if any of the following change, you’ll need to note it in your application:
<ul>
 	<li>Address</li>
 	<li>Phone number</li>
 	<li>Email address</li>
 	<li>Income</li>
 	<li>Family composition</li>
 	<li>Waiting list preferences</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Your contact information is especially crucial. If the PHA needs to contact you and can’t due to outdated info, you may be taken off the waiting list.
<h4>2. Pay attention to the waiting time.</h4>
Since some waiting lists can take years to process, contact your PHA to find out where you stand. This can help you better plan your next moves.

Some PHAs will tell you how long you’ll have to wait, or they’ll reveal your placement on the list so you can see any progress.
<h4>3. Notify your PHA of any preferences that may apply to your situation.</h4>
Some situations can receive preferential treatment on the waiting list, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Victims of domestic violence.</li>
 	<li>Families affected by natural disasters.</li>
 	<li>Veterans.</li>
 	<li>Local residents.</li>
 	<li>The homeless.</li>
 	<li>Anyone paying over half their income in rent.</li>
 	<li>Anyone living in substandard housing.</li>
</ul>
If any of those apply, be sure to mention it to your PHA. It could reduce your Section 8 waiting time.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Search for other open waiting lists.</h4>
Your PHA can let you know of other open waiting lists you can sign up for. This strategy can accelerate your wait time by broadening your options.
<h4>5. Prepare yourself by looking at housing.</h4>
Look for Section 8 housing in your desired area while you wait. Even if you don’t have the Housing Choice Voucher yet, knowing what’s out there can keep you prepared for when your name is called.
<h4>6. Always check your status.</h4>
As mentioned, an application with inaccurate data could lead to removal from a waiting list. Unless you check your application’s status periodically, you may not know if you were removed, which could lengthen your waiting time even more as you’ll need to re-apply.

<h4>7. Sign up for notifications.</h4>
If possible, sign up for SMS or text message notifications from PHAs or property owners so you can be instantly notified of any news. The quicker you can respond, the faster you can get your voucher and Section 8 home.","The high demand for Section 8 vouchers can leave you waiting a long time to receive the money you need to move.

4823,"Know Your Rights When Using Your Section 8 Housing Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) runs the Housing Choice Voucher program. It helps low-income families with rental assistance, and while the HUD holds the federal funds, its local Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) that disburse them.

You’ll be dealing with a PHA if you make the move to secure a housing voucher. You can find your nearest PHA here to contact them and kickstart the Section 8 application process.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

If your application is approved, you will then be put on a waiting list, which may be lengthy. In the months or even years that you’ll be waiting for your housing voucher, you may decide to start looking at Section 8 rentals.

As you search for properties, you must know your rights as a Section 8 renter. What are they? Let’s have a look at them now.
<h4>Your Section 8 Rights Under the Fair Housing Act</h4>
Will your housing voucher be accepted at any property you desire? Not necessarily. But those who do accept Section 8 vouchers must adhere to specific rules. If they do not, you can contact your PHA or the HUD to complain.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Per the Fair Housing Act, it is illegal for property owners that accept low-income housing vouchers to:
<ul>
 	<li>Say that a property is unavailable when it is available.</li>
 	<li>Refuse to sell or rent housing to you.</li>
 	<li>Advertise housing to only certain groups of people.</li>
 	<li>Offer different housing facilities or services.</li>
 	<li>Create different conditions, privileges, or terms for the rental or sale of a property.</li>
 	<li>Discriminate when conducting property appraisals.</li>
 	<li>Refuse property insurance.</li>
</ul>
In addition to that list, a property owner must also let you modify the home if needed to make it fully functional. As long as you pay for the modifications and, in some instances, agree to restore the property to its original condition when you leave, they cannot deny you this right. It’s worth adding that the modifications must be “reasonable,” as well.

The house must be accessible, especially if a disabled person will be living there. Accessibility can refer to the design and construction of the home, as well as any rules or services.

Lastly, nobody can interfere, intimidate, coerce, or harass anyone helping you with your Fair Housing rights. If they do, contact your PHA so the proper action can be taken.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

If and when you do decide to move, it’s worth noting that you can take the Housing Choice Voucher with you. To get all of the specifics if you’re planning a move, be sure to contact your PHA first to be sure.

While the entire Section 8 application process may seem like a lot to swallow, it’s well worth it if you can get a housing voucher. By getting help with the rent, you won’t have to worry as much about putting a roof over your family’s head.","A Section 8 housing voucher can give you the assistance you need to live in a safe, affordable home.

4842,"Section 8 Rental Scams To Avoid","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What do most people do when they get curious about rental assistance? They search Section 8 online.

The Internet is loaded with information on everything under the sun, and Section 8 affordable housing is no exception. Since scammers know people often search for such info, they do their best to take advantage of unsuspecting customers.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What are the biggest Section 8 rental scams you need to watch for?
<h4>Application Fee Scams</h4>
If the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created the Section 8 program to help low-income families in need, does it make sense that they’d charge for an application? Of course not, which is why you should never pay to apply for Section 8.

Some sites will claim to hold tons of information on housing vouchers, or they’ll say you can apply through them for a program. To access these benefits, they’ll ask for money upfront and take you to a payment screen before you can see any info.

If you see such a site, don’t click the “Apply Now” button or something similar, unless you want to pay for what’s virtually worthless information.

According to HUD policy, application fees for its Housing Choice Voucher program (the new name for Section 8) are prohibited.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Data Collection Scams</h4>
Whenever you do an online search for Section 8 or Housing Choice Vouchers, you may instantly see ads on the topic. These paid ads are usually fronts for something else.

Instead of helping you apply for a housing voucher, they’ll take your information and sell it to someone else.

If a marketing company buys that information via massive lists and you’re on it, guess what? You’ll be hounded with spam offers via email, phone, or any other way they can contact you.

Can you legitimately apply online for a Housing Choice voucher? Sure, but that will only be via a Public Housing Agency (PHA) website.

If you really want to play it safe, ask them how you can fill out your application in person.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Voucher Scams</h4>
Just like you should never pay to apply for a voucher, you shouldn’t pay to get one either.

Beware of promises online that say they can accelerate your time on a voucher waiting list by paying a fee. If you pay it, not only will you still be stuck on the lengthy waiting list, but you’ll lose your money as well.

The best way to reduce your waiting time for a voucher once approved is to tell the housing agency that you’re homeless, paying over half your income in rent, or staying in substandard housing. You could also apply to more than one waiting list simultaneously.
<h4>Deposit Scams</h4>
You should never have to pay a deposit to visit a property or receive more information on it. Online classified sites are filled with such posts that require a deposit to see a property in person, know more about it, or reserve it.

Never send payment via Bitcoin, PayPal, credit card, or wire for such a service, as it’s almost 100 percent a scam. A real landlord would let you view a property or get information on it for free.","A Section 8 voucher can give you the rental assistance you need to keep a roof over your head.

4845,"How To Get Credit Card Debt Relief During COVID-19","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you have credit card debt, here’s what you can do to keep bill collectors at bay.

Paying credit card debt may have been difficult before. Paying it now, however, may be impossible if you’ve lost your job or income from the coronavirus shutdown.

Could stimulus checks or unemployment benefits from the government make it easier to pay your credit card bills? Sure, but you may not qualify for those benefits, or you may be waiting a while to collect them.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

For this reason, you’ll need to reach out to your creditors to keep your debt as manageable as possible, and to keep your credit score protected.
<h4>Why You Should Contact Creditors</h4>
Although some credit card companies may be more lenient right now, they probably won’t reach out to you to provide relief. Instead, you’ll have to initiate contact to explain any payment problems you’re having.

What happens if you ignore your bills? You could make your debt grow even larger via late fees, penalties, higher interest, and more.

Also, your credit score could take a hit, which would make your future expenses and the cost of securing any loans or credit even higher.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Relief Options Being Offered by Creditors in Response to COVID-19</h4>
Credit card issuers need to make money now more than ever. Since consumer spending is decreased due to loss of employment or income, it’s in an issuer’s best interest to negotiate with cardholders. How can they do this? By offering relief via:
<ul>
 	<li>Postponements or new payment dates</li>
 	<li>Skipped payments</li>
 	<li>Lower monthly payments</li>
 	<li>Higher credit limits</li>
 	<li>Lowering interest rates temporarily</li>
 	<li>Waiving interest charges or late fees</li>
</ul>
Is everyone eligible for these forms of credit card relief? No, as some companies are offering them on a case-by-case basis.

It’s also important to realize that some of these moves are temporary, and may only last for one to three months. In short, you’ll be expected to pay regularly as soon as everything gets back to normal.

<h4>Steps to Get Short-Term Credit Card Relief</h4>
As mentioned, you’ll need to contact the credit card issuer to get relief. And it’s best to do this before you miss any payments and they start contacting you.

Here are some simple steps to follow:
<ul>
 	<li>Figure out which form of relief would be most helpful to your situation (waived fees, new due dates, higher credit limits, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Have any documentation regarding job or income loss handy.</li>
 	<li>Call your issuer. You can find the phone number on the back of your credit card.</li>
 	<li>Be honest about your situation and ask what your options are.</li>
 	<li>If possible, get any agreement or changes to your bill in writing.</li>
</ul>
While making these moves may not cancel your debts, they should give you some breathing room to get your finances in order.

<h4>Credit Card Relief Scams</h4>
Con artists are using COVID-19 to their advantage. Beware of any phone calls, texts, or emails you receive from scammers pretending to be credit card companies.

The good news is that there are ways to negotiate with cable, Internet, and utility companies when it comes to your bills. And some have even eased up on their billing for the time being.

The last thing you need during a quarantine is to have your utilities, cable, or phone shut off. Unfortunately, a lack of money may make it hard to pay your bills, which could lead to a suspension of service.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Luckily, some companies have decided not to suspend services for non-payment while also waiving late fees, and you’ll find a list of them near the bottom of this article. Right now, let’s discuss what you should do if you can’t pay one of your bills.

The most obvious tip is not to ignore the bill. Not opening it or tossing it in the trash will only make your situation worse. And if you forget or refuse to pay, you could literally end up in the dark or be stuck inside without any Internet or phone service.

Contact the company in question immediately and speak to a representative. Tell them your situation and give them details as to why you cannot pay your bill.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Did the company you work for have to shut down due to the coronavirus outbreak? Were you laid off or furloughed? Are your hours reduced? Whatever the case may be, explain it in detail, so the representative knows the whole story.

Since COVID-19 has negatively affected almost every corner of the world, you’ll have a better chance of gaining some leeway with the company right now more than ever. As long as you’re polite, they may give you several options on how to handle your bill.

They may allow you to postpone your payment or get an extension. They may waive any expensive late fees or penalties that you owe. You may be able to set up a payment plan that better fits your budget. Or, in some cases, the company may refer you to services that can assist with paying your bills.

Should you succeed in getting a payment plan set up, ask to obtain confirmation of it in writing, so you have proof if you need it.

To prevent future issues with utility bills or get government assistance now, have a look at the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). It can help reduce your cooling and heating costs.
<h4>Companies With Temporarily Changes to Their Billing Procedures Due to COVID-19</h4>
Here’s a list of companies that have decided to make moves like waive late fees, suspend shutoffs for lack of payment, or provide free or upgraded services due to the coronavirus pandemic.

4923,"4 Reasons To Use A Government-Approved Housing Counselor","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are several reasons why consulting a counselor is a smart move.
<h4>1. Housing counselors make a complicated process easier to understand.</h4>
There are a ton of steps and paperwork involved in renting or purchasing housing. With a HUD-approved counselor, you can get one-on-one personal counseling to navigate you every step of the way. This can increase your chances of getting a home to fit your needs, while also saving you money in the short and long term.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Depending on your situation, you can get a housing counselor at a low cost or even free. They can then keep you well-informed via appointments, access to resources like informational videos, classes, workshops, and referrals.

Some of the most common topics covered by housing counselors include:
<ul>
 	<li>Making the most of your finances now and in the future.</li>
 	<li>How to rent like a pro.</li>
 	<li>The whole story behind homebuying.</li>
 	<li>How to deal with a default.</li>
 	<li>What to do to prevent foreclosure.</li>
 	<li>If a reverse mortgage is ideal for you.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Housing counselors can help with a wide variety of situations.</h4>
Regardless of your age or income status, a government-approved housing counselor in your area can help. It doesn’t matter if you want to rent or own, either.

Some situations where having a housing counselor comes in handy include when you’re:
<ul>
 	<li>Looking to buy your first home.</li>
 	<li>Already own a home, but want help with upgrading your situation.</li>
 	<li>Close to jumping into a reverse mortgage.</li>
 	<li>Homeless and without adequate housing.</li>
 	<li>The victim of a natural or human-made disaster.</li>
 	<li>At risk of foreclosure and financially distressed.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. You can save money.</h4>
As mentioned, a government-approved housing counselor can help you keep more money in your pocket. This is achieved not only by showing you affordable housing options, but also by helping you boost your credit score, teaching you how to budget, and more.

According to the HUD Office of Housing Counseling, hiring a counselor has made a significant difference in the following ways by advising over one million households per year:
<ul>
 	<li>Created 1.1 million budgets to help people manage their money.</li>
 	<li>Prevented 200,000 foreclosures to help people stay in their homes.</li>
 	<li>Improved the finances of over 541,000 households.</li>
</ul>
Saving money can be a particularly daunting task when buying your first home. With a counselor, you’ll know exactly how much home you can afford, what down payment you’ll need, how to budget for your mortgage payment, and more.

By having this helping hand, the HUD Office of Policy Development and Research reports that over half of those counseled were able to buy their home within a year.

A new bill also promises to deliver stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants that have contributed to the US tax system. This provision along with the removal of the $10k cap on deducting state and local income tax (SALT) on federal tax forms have been tough pills for the GOP to swallow.

<h4>The IRS’ Efforts</h4>
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reportedly paid out over $218 billion in stimulus checks already, including 110 million direct deposits and 20 million mailed paper checks. The tax agency began to issue payments on the 13th of April and still has roughly about another $70 billion left to distribute.

The financial relief is essential for the growing number of Americans that find themselves out of work due to prolonged business closures around the country. There’s also a large number of Americans who haven’t received the much needed help due to lack of a bank account or pending immigration status.

The ones who have received the check are complaining that it isn’t even enough to last them through the month.","Continued financial pressure from the pandemic has many Americans requesting a second round of stimulus checks.

4934,"5 Ways Current And Future COVID-19 Stimulus Assistance Can Help You","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act offers several ways to help you fill any financial gaps caused due to the coronavirus outbreak. We’ll discuss some of the highlights of the current package, and hint at what may be coming soon to help you even more.
<h4>1. $600 Weekly Unemployment Assistance</h4>
Although the CARES Act’s $1,200 stimulus checks may be its most commonly discussed or known benefit, unemployment assistance is worth mentioning first. Why? Because, if you qualify, you can get $600 per week for 13 weeks in unemployment benefits in addition to whatever your state offers.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Qualifying for such financial assistance can help greatly if you lost your job due to COVID-19, saw reduced income, or were furloughed. Unlike regular unemployment assistance, the CARES Act’s version offers help for independent contractors as well.

To get $600 weekly unemployment benefits from the CARES Act, apply through your state.
<h4>2. $1,200 Stimulus Checks</h4>
If you filed taxes in 2018 or 2019, there’s no need to apply to qualify for $1,200 stimulus checks from the CARES Act. The IRS will use your latest tax return to determine eligibility and disburse funds.

Here’s a basic overview of how these COVID-19 stimulus payments work in terms of eligibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Adults can get $1,200 if they make up to $75,000.</li>
 	<li>Couples who file jointly can get $2,400 if they make up to $150,000.</li>
 	<li>Each child who qualifies adds an extra $500 in benefits to the household.</li>
 	<li>Adults who make up to $99,000 can still qualify for a smaller amount, as can couples who make up to $198,000.</li>
</ul>
If you haven’t received your stimulus funds yet, go here to check their status.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Mortgage Assistance and Eviction Protection</h4>
Do you have a federally- backed mortgage? If so, you can enjoy these benefits from the CARES Act:
<ul>
 	<li>60-day forbearance on mortgage payments.</li>
 	<li>The ability to extend that forbearance by four more 30-day periods.</li>
 	<li>Lenders cannot charge you any penalties or fees during this time.</li>
</ul>
To receive these benefits that can give you some time to get your finances in order, communicate with your lender and tell them how your situation has changed as a result of the coronavirus.

Also, if the owners in your building have federally-backed mortgages, you can enjoy these benefits from the CARES Act:
<ul>
 	<li>No eviction for not paying rent for 120 days.</li>
 	<li>Zero penalties or fees during this time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Federal Student Loan Forbearance</h4>
Do you have student loans where the U.S. Department of Education is the lender? If so, you won’t have to make payments on them and there will be 0% interest until the end of September.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Possible Future Stimulus Benefits</h4>
Here are some possibilities as to what future stimulus packages may offer, with Congress possibly making decisions on them in June:
<ul>
 	<li>Another round of $1,200 stimulus checks.</li>
 	<li>$600 weekly unemployment benefits extended until January 2021.</li>
 	<li>Hazard pay or bonuses for essential workers during COVID-19.</li>

4944,"8 Reasons To Start Working From Home","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3>The Pros Of Working From Home</h3>
<h4>Cut Costs</h4>
A significant portion of your paycheck could be going to costs related to having to work in an office.

For instance, there are the transportation costs of getting to and from work, which could include wear and tear on your vehicle, plus gas. Eating out while at work can put a big dent in your budget as well.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you start working at home, you should be able to cut those transportation costs completely. You can cut food costs as well by eating what’s in your kitchen.

What about if you have children? Childcare can be insanely expensive to the point you may be better off quitting your job to take care of the kids yourself. By working at home, you can also cut childcare costs and keep more money in your pocket.
<h4>Save Time</h4>
Long commutes and having to fight through traffic could be considered as a couple of the worst aspects of going to work. When your home is your office, commutes and traffic disappear, as you can simply walk a few steps to work.

Depending on how far you live from the workplace, transitioning to a telecommuting setup could save you several hours each day that could be spent doing something else.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Flexible Schedule</h4>
In most work-at-home arrangements, your employer probably only cares that you get the job done. Provided you complete tasks on time, you can set up your work-at-home schedule as you wish.

Instead of being stuck in the office 9-5, you could mix in a morning trip to the gym, some errands, and a late afternoon lunch. Since everyone operates differently, this scheduling flexibility could make you more productive and help you accomplish more in terms of both work and personal tasks.
<h4>Pick Your Uniform</h4>
If the thought of wearing office clothing in a scorching summer scares you, that’s not a problem once you work from home. Even though some experts suggest you “dress up” to work at home, you can pick what you want to wear, including pajamas.

<h4>Fewer Distractions</h4>
Your mileage may vary here, especially if you have pets, partners, kids, or roommates seeking your attention at home. Provided you can control distractions, however, working at home should present fewer of them than a bustling workplace filled with employees and customers.
<h4>More Silence</h4>
Trying to get work done in an office can be a tough task, especially if your employer allows music to be played and there are no noise barriers present. At home, you should be able to enjoy more silence, which leads to more focus and productivity.
<h4>Less Stress</h4>
The aforementioned traffic, time wasted, coworkers, noise, and even figuring out what to wear can all make your stress levels skyrocket. Once you get into a remote work setup, several of those stressors should disappear.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Extra Time for Friends and Family</h4>
Manage your time wisely, and you should find more time in your schedule to spend with your loved ones. For some, this could be the most significant benefit of them all.","Should you join the masses who have made the move to start working from home?

Now that you know it’s possible to convert your unique skill set into income, let’s look at where some online opportunities may lie.

If one site requires experience, don’t give up. Some don’t require experience for individual gigs, and others will let you create your own class where you can teach anything from a language to how to garden.

The Internet isn’t the only way to get a tutoring job you can perform at home, either. Reach out to people you know and tell them your tutoring intentions. They may have children or relatives who need your services for a fee.
<h4>Social Media Management</h4>
You’ve probably used social media before, but did you know you could get paid to manage other people’s or business’s profiles? You sure can as a social media manager, where you’ll be asked to do things like come up with creatives, make posts and put up pics, and more.

You can find social media management jobs by creating profiles on sites like Upwork or Fiverr.

<h4>Virtual Assistant</h4>
You may think a virtual assistant gets paid to perform office-related work, but anyone who needs help completing everyday tasks could use your help. They’ll be willing to pay for it, too, if you’re good at organizing, are easy to reach, and can complete tasks on time.

5012,"Guide To A Life Free of Cable TV","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you think cable television is the only way to watch your favorite shows, think again. Today, new and cheaper options such as streaming have helped many households cut the cord and save money. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Streaming services have made it possible to watch shows at any time, for a much lower price than cable television. In this article, we explain which steps must be taken to cut the cord without losing access to live channels or your favorite shows.</span>

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3><b>HD Antenna</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The least expensive option is purchasing a high definition antenna. These devices are fairly cheap and can be used to watch live TV without having to subscribe to any services at all. HD antennas are modern versions of the old school   antennas which are likely no longer compatible with today’s televisions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An HD antenna is best when within range of a signal from local broadcast stations. The antenna will pick up news and sports stations. A good HD antenna can be purchased for less than $50. There are no subscription fees or fixed contracts. As soon as the antenna is plugged in, viewers will know what  channels are available in their area. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HD signals can travel over 20 miles without losing quality but that means you will have to live relatively close to broadcast towers. If you live close to the busy part of your city there likely are broadcast towers around. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Living further away may deteriorate the picture quality through an HD antenna. In such a case, purchasing a streaming device or a streaming subscription may be a better solution.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h3><b>Streaming Devices</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a wider selection of options, try a streaming service. Streaming works best on smart tv’s but even older units stream using a specially made device. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The market currently has many different options to choose from, including set-top boxes, game consoles, streaming sticks, and more. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Among these, the most popular devices are Roku Express, Google Chromecast, Amazon Firestick and Apple TV because their products are of higher quality. Buying a game console from Sony or Microsoft is also a choice, although they are more expensive. Sony’s PlayStation 4 costs between $250 and $400. The Xbox One, sold by Microsoft, can be purchased for a similar price.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before buying a device however, consider that in recent years, Smart TVs have become increasingly common and are much less expensive so it may be worth buying a brand new “smart TV” equipped with internet and apps that can stream.</span>

<h3><b>Streaming Services</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many streaming services to choose from, including Netflix, Amazon Prime and <strong><a href=""http://c.mammothaward.com/clk.ashx?cid=58278&amp;provider_id=[pid]&amp;cqs=idx&amp;md5=[md5]"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hulu</a></strong>. Netflix costs between $9 and $16 per month, while customers can subscribe to Amazon Prime for $120 per year. Both streaming services include access to movies and TV shows. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, some content is not available on these platforms. Companies like Disney have developed their own streaming solutions for customers who are only seeking content from specific producers. Also, the basic streaming plans do not include access to live TV. This service is offered in more comprehensive plans, though they are also more expensive.</span>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3><b>Cable-Replacement Services</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Standard streaming services are not meant to replace cable television. However, there are online solutions good enough to replace cable. The most popular cable replacement services are <a href=""http://c.mammothaward.com/clk.ashx?cid=58278&amp;provider_id=[pid]&amp;cqs=idx&amp;md5=[md5]"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Hulu TV</strong></a>, DirecTV Now and Youtube TV. Other services, such as Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, are also available.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cable replacement streaming plans work just like having cable at home. The main difference is that live channels as streamed over the internet rather than coming through an analog wire. The number of available channels will depend on which streaming company is chosen, though they all carry the most watched channels such as ESPN, NBC, CBS and CNN.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong><a href=""http://c.mammothaward.com/clk.ashx?cid=58278&amp;provider_id=[pid]&amp;cqs=idx&amp;md5=[md5]"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hulu TV</a></strong> for example offers access to many popular shows. It also includes a original movies and series across a wide variety of genres. Customers can also buy access to more channels, such as HBO, for an additional monthly fee. A comprehensive package, which costs about $45 will include all other content.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hulu is owned by Disney and NBCUniversal. As a result, movies and shows produced by these companies are often available first on the platform. Customers who want to try the service can take advantage of a trial offered to new subscribers. The first month is given for free. New customers also gain access to seven-day trials of premium channels such as HBO.</span>


<h3><b>Other Services</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The streaming market has thousands of channels, movies and TV shows to watch. Viewers can organize their library with services like Plex, which allows them to manage content from their computers and then stream it to the television, mobile device or other computer. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plex can also be used to watch and record live TV, which makes it a useful tool for people who have an HD antenna or pay for services like DirecTV Now and Hulu TV. Plex is also useful to keep track of live shows that are not available yet in streaming platforms.</span>",,"2019-09-10 18:07:40",post,https://mammothawards.com/guide-to-a-life-free-of-cable-tv/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_762987127.jpg,shutterstock_762987127.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_762987127.jpg,86,shutterstock_762987127,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_762987127.jpg,"Financial Help","Quick Money",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,guide-to-a-life-free-of-cable-tv,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-09 18:41:01"

It may sound super-simple, but never shopping when your hungry is a major money-saving tip you should follow. If you stick to your list, it shouldn’t be as much of an issue, but avoid the temptation anyway.

Should you regret not participating in Black Friday or Cyber Monday? No, because even though there may be some deals to be had, the rest of the year can offer great discounts too.

While there are ways to get price alerts to see instant deals year-round, we won’t talk about that today. Instead, we’ll discuss why Black Friday and Cyber Monday may not be as great as they seem due to a couple of pricing tricks.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Price Manipulation Before Big Sales</h3>
Do you ever wonder how stores can offer such huge discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday? Sometimes the discounts are so deep, it seems like they’re giving items away.

The truth is, some of those price cuts you see aren’t that deep since stores can inflate prices beforehand. This can create the illusion that you’re snagging significant savings when you’re really not.

Artificial price inflation can be quite common in the days leading up to colossal shopping holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If a store sees that its competitors have extremely low prices on a product, they can meet those prices quickly. If the original price wasn’t too high, though, that discount won’t seem as impressive.

How will a store even the playing field if this is the case? They’ll inflate the original price of the item, even if they never sold it at that amount.

By listing a higher original price, they can now display a significant discount to entice people to buy. And even though the original price is fake, most consumers won’t notice, which results in an easy win for the retailer.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>Fake Prices from the Start</h3>
Manufacturers make some products with one thing in mind: To sell at a low price.

Are such products high quality? No, and they’re not meant to be. They’re simply meant to have a low price as soon as they hit the shelves so they can garner easy sales.

What do some retailers do with these products before putting them on display? They artificially inflate their original price tags. Even though the manufacturer never suggested such a high price, the store displays it anyway.

How does this help the store? It makes it much easier for them to display a significant discount. Once a consumer sees that supposedly huge discount, they’ll get tricked into thinking they must buy the item since it’s such a good deal.

If a store can list an inflated original price from the outset, it will also make their Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals look much juicier than they really are.

Keep this in mind when others try to entice you to spend on these highly popular retail holidays.

<h3>How to Stay on Top of Price Manipulation</h3>
Before the Internet appeared, it was incredibly easy for stores to manipulate prices without anyone knowing any better. Now, however, you can avoid such price manipulation by doing your research online.

If you see an advertisement for a deeply discounted item, look it up online to see what other stores are offering.

Do they all have the same original prices? Is one store’s original price much higher than others? If so, that store’s sale may not be so great.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Simple searches can yield the information you’re looking for whenever you need it. And if you want to get even more tech-savvy, try downloading a price comparison app.

ShopSavvy is one of the better ones out there. It will show you price comparisons for products online and in stores so you can make an informed decision minus the manipulation.","Retailers use tons of tricks during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and beyond to get you to spend more.

5059,"3 Things Every Late Rent Hardship Letter Should Include","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

When you can’t pay your rent on time, you have two main options. The first is to avoid the issue, which won’t go away on its own and will only make the problem worse.

The second is to confront the issue head-on, which means communicating with your landlord to come up with a temporary agreement until you get your finances in order.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the best way to convey the bad news that you can’t pay the rent? Writing a late rent hardship letter, which should include the following elements to get your landlord to give you some leeway.
<h4>Crucial Elements of a Late Rent Hardship Letter</h4>
When writing to your landlord, you can’t just say that the rent will be late and you have no idea when it will be paid. Instead, you have to make a convincing argument to make them agree to your request.

To make your argument persuasive, here are some things you should include in your letter:
<h4>1. A detailed explanation of why the rent will be late.</h4>
Chances are, this will not be the first late rent hardship letter your landlord will read, so don’t feel ashamed when writing it. Rent is a significant monthly expense, and when income disappears, making that payment can become impossible.

Here is where you’ll have to explain why your income disappeared. When doing so, it’s best to include details such as dates and monetary amounts.

For example, did you lose your job, or were you furloughed due to COVID-19 or some other disaster? Was your employer forced to close down?

Either would be completely understandable reasons for having difficulties paying the rent. Other common reasons that some tenants run into are unexpected medical expenses, accidents, divorce, etc.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Regardless of the reason, list it in detail and be honest about your situation. Provided you haven’t had payment issues in the past, your landlord should understand your predicament.
<h4>2. A list of things you are doing to fix the situation.</h4>
Now that your landlord sees why you’ll be late paying the rent, they need to know how you’re going to fix the problem.

Simply explaining that you lost your job or income isn’t enough. You have to now give them peace of mind that you will be making a payment, as they have expenses themselves.

If you lost your job, are you looking for another? If so, how many interviews have you had? Are you applying for loans to help you in the meantime?

Whatever you’ve been doing to replace your income, list it in your hardship letter. To beef it up, add in details on when you had interviews, where you applied for a loan, etc.
<h4>3. A promise to pay.</h4>
As mentioned, your landlord has expenses of their own. If you can’t pay the rent, you can cause cash flow issues for them. This is why you must also include a date when you plan to pay the rent.

If possible, make a partial payment. Then promise to have the rest by a specific date so your landlord can plan accordingly.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

As simple as those three elements are, they are vital to making a convincing argument. To put them all together without having to come up with something on the fly, search for a late rent hardship letter template.

Plug in your information and details, print it out, and send it off to your landlord as soon as possible.","If you’re contemplating writing a late rent hardship letter because money’s tight this month, don’t forget to include these key elements to support your argument.","2021-05-26 05:20:22",post,https://mammothawards.com/3-things-every-late-rent-hardship-letter-should-include/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_380712985.jpg,shutterstock_380712985.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_380712985.jpg,318,shutterstock_380712985,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_380712985.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","Rental Assistance",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,3-things-every-late-rent-hardship-letter-should-include,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-17 14:13:24"
5061,"How To Apply For WIC Food Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

With COVID-19 causing so much economic destruction, you can use all the help you can get, especially when it comes to food. And while food stamps may be an option, why stop there? Should you qualify, you can get even more food assistance via the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The WIC Application Process</h4>
To qualify for WIC food assistance, you’ll have to meet four essential requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Categorical</li>
 	<li>Income</li>
 	<li>Residency</li>
 	<li>Nutritional risk</li>
</ul>
Although that may seem like a lot of requirements, they really aren’t. And you can see if you meet those requirements in a matter of minutes by using the WIC Prescreening Tool online.

This handy tool won’t guarantee that you qualify for WIC benefits, as you’ll have to do that officially via your local WIC agency, which can be found here. What the tool will help you do is see if you could be eligible for food assistance, which can help you take the next steps to get those benefits.

Your best bet is to start with the Prescreening Tool and answering a few quick questions. You’ll be asked if you or anyone in your household is pregnant, has recently had a baby, etc. to determine general eligibility.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

You’ll also be asked where you live, and if you or anyone in your household, including children, is enrolled in any other benefits programs, such as SNAP (food stamps), TANF, or Medicaid. As you continue answering questions, the tool may find that you’re eligible.

At that point, you will be given a link to find your local agency. This is so you can make an appointment to begin your WIC application process officially.

Several documents will need to be present at your appointment so that your eligibility can be confirmed. While these documents may vary according to your location, here is a list of examples of what you’ll need to bring:

Proof of income:
<ul>
 	<li>Recent paycheck stubs</li>
 	<li>SSI or Social Security</li>
 	<li>Recent income tax return</li>
 	<li>Unemployment benefits</li>
 	<li>Proof of child support or alimony</li>
</ul>
Proof of enrollment in current benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, etc.:
<ul>
 	<li>Notice of program eligibility</li>
 	<li>Program ID card</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Proof of identity (for applicable household members):
<ul>
 	<li>Photo ID</li>
 	<li>Social Security card</li>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Voter registration</li>
 	<li>Medical records</li>
 	<li>Immunization records</li>
</ul>
Proof of residency:
<ul>
 	<li>Receipt of rent/mortgage</li>
 	<li>Lease agreement</li>
 	<li>Current utility bill</li>
</ul>
Proof of pregnancy (if applicable):
<ul>
 	<li>Sonogram</li>
 	<li>Estimated date of conception statement</li>
 	<li>Expected date of delivery statement</li>
 	<li>Positive pregnancy test statement</li>
</ul>
Will you need to bring every single document above with you? No, as each local agency has its own set of requirements. For this reason, it’s best to contact yours beforehand to make sure.

It’s best to kickstart this process as quickly as possible so you can receive your benefits quickly. The WIC Prescreening tool is straightforward to use, so go here to begin now. At the very least, you can find out if WIC may be a food assistance option within the next few minutes.","If you think that getting WIC food assistance is too complicated or time-consuming, keep reading, as we’ll show you how simple it can be.","2020-10-06 17:25:27",post,https://mammothawards.com/how-to-apply-for-wic-food-assistance/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_573819535.jpg,shutterstock_573819535.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_573819535.jpg,323,shutterstock_573819535,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_573819535.jpg,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,how-to-apply-for-wic-food-assistance,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:58:52"

5065,"How To Get Down Payment Assistance When Buying A Home","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What’s usually needed to buy a home? Things like a <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/a-one-minute-guide-to-understanding-your-credit-score/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">solid credit score</a> and a significant down payment so you can secure a loan.

Putting together a down payment can be tough if you don’t make much income, and most of your money goes to bills. With down payment assistance (DPA), though, you can get that cash you need to get a home without having to wait years to accumulate savings.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

How does down payment assistance work? Let’s have a look so you can start seeing what opportunities are out there.
<h4>Down Payment Assistance (DPA) Programs</h4>
There are four main types of DPAs. The most common is a grant, which carries the benefit of never having to be repaid. In this sense, you could look at it as a gift or free money.

The next type of DPA is a loan that acts like a second mortgage and must be paid down with your primary mortgage.

Another DPA is a loan (second mortgage) that has deferred payments. You can put off making them until you decide to refinance, move, or sell the home.

The fourth and final type of DPA is a loan (second mortgage) that is forgiven for a specific number of years. This period can range from 5-20 years. Such DPAs only need to be repaid if you refinance, move, or sell.

The interest rates on these DPA loans vary. Some may have no interest, while others will be lower, equal, or higher than your first mortgage.
<h4>DPA Requirements</h4>
Each down payment assistance program has its requirements. Most exist to help first-time homebuyers. If you haven’t owned a home within the last three years, you could still classify as a first-time homebuyer.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Here are some other requirements that come with most DPAs:
<ul>
 	<li>The home must be in a qualified area or “targeted” census tract.</li>
 	<li>The buyer falls into either the low or moderate-income category.</li>
 	<li>The house must be used as the primary residence.</li>
 	<li>An approved mortgage lender must be used.</li>
 	<li>An approved mortgage program must be used.</li>
</ul>
Mortgages That Work With Down Payment Assistance

As mentioned, you may have to use an approved lender and participate in a particular mortgage program to qualify for DPA. Again, this depends on where you live.

Typically, you can use DPA with popular loan programs such as FHA, USDA, and VA loans. Conventional loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commonly work with DPA too.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Find Down Payment Assistance</h4>
It may take a while to find the perfect DPA, as funding can come from a variety of sources, such as charitable funds, the federal level, and cities, counties, and states.

The most direct way to find these programs is to search online for “down payment assistance grants in _____.” You can fill in the blank with the desired city, county, or state.","Government housing assistance doesn’t just come in the form of Section 8 vouchers for rent, as you can get help with the down payment on a home too.

If you’re like most, here’s what’s probably on your mind right now:
<ul>
 	<li>Staying safe by quarantining and wearing a mask.</li>
 	<li>Figuring out how to pay your bills.</li>
 	<li>Wondering how you’ll keep buying food when your funds get low.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

All of those are essential worries, but since we are human, the last one may be the most important for survival.

How can you survive if you can barely buy food due to a lack of work and income? By getting food assistance from the government, which is much better than having to scrounge up extra cash, buy canned goods, and starve yourself until things get back to normal.

How can you find food assistance from the government? By heading to USA.gov and seeing all of the benefits it could potentially offer you and your family.
<h3>USA.gov’s Food Assistance Options</h3>
A quick trip to USA.gov’s home page makes it rather evident that this is a humongous website filled with money-saving resources. For the purpose of this article, though, we’ll take a closer look at its food assistance section.

Here are the various ways to get food assistance during COVID-19 from this one page:

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>1. Immediate Food Aid</h4>
What can you do when your family is hungry now, and the refrigerator is empty? Besides asking a neighbor or family member for some extra food, you can call the USDA National Hunger Hotline by dialing 1-866-3-HUNGRY on your phone.

From 7 am to 10 pm, Monday through Friday, you can get information in English or Spanish on how to find food assistance quickly.

Calling the National Hunger Hotline isn’t the only way to get immediate food aid, though, as you can also dial 211 to see if there are any community or religious organizations in your city that can help.
<h4>2. Food Stamps</h4>
You’ve probably heard of these before, but if you’ve never applied for food stamps, USA.gov’s food assistance page will help you do so.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the more formal name for this benefit, which can give you a bigger food budget when times get tough.

Should you qualify, you could get funds deposited on a card that can be used at participating stores. Swipe it, and you can get the food you need even if your bank account is depleted due to COVID-19.
<h4>3. WIC</h4>
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) can help you fill your kitchen with healthy food. As its name suggests, this program specifically helps women and younger children.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

It’s worth noting that the government has eased restrictions and made getting SNAP and WIC benefits easier due to the coronavirus outbreak. Applying for these programs may be simpler, and you may enjoy more lucrative benefits than before.

4. Food Schoolkids and Senior Citizens

Kids can get school meals even if they’re not attending in-person classes due to COVID-19. Seniors may qualify for free food as well. You can find out more about food assistance for either unique situation by looking near the bottom of the USA.gov food assistance page.","Where’s the best place to find food assistance during COVID-19?

5174,"Going Back To School? Here Are Some Tips To Keep In Mind","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>Tips To Keep Your School Costs Low</h4>
Yes, advanced education can be costly nowadays, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to make it more affordable.

For starters, you can choose to attend community college over a four-year university. While you may not get the whole “college experience” that comes with being on a big campus, a local community college can significantly cut tuition costs. Get your standard classes and credits out of the way while you save some cash and maybe work a job on the side, and you can transfer to a more prominent college or university later on.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Speaking of jobs, if you’re currently working, ask your employer about tuition assistance. Some have such programs that can chip in and help reduce some of your college expenses. And since you pay taxes on income from that job, read the Tax Benefits for Education <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PDF</a> from the IRS. It explains the variety of tax credits available for students.

If you’re working full time and are very busy as it is, you may want to consider being a part-time student. Taking fewer credits will obviously lower your tuition costs, and that can take a load off as you get acclimated to going back to school. Before you make the move to become a part-time student, however, keep in mind that it could negatively impact your federal student aid eligibility.

Not only is choosing your status as a full or part-time student important, so are the classes you’ll take. If money is tight, you don’t want to take courses that don’t count towards your certificate or degree. Be extra careful when picking your semester schedule, so every class and every dollar spent counts.

What’s one of the most obvious ways to keep school costs low? Apply for scholarships. If you already have a school picked out, contact the financial aid office and ask what scholarships are available. You’ll also find tons of scholarships <a href=""https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> at the Department of Labor’s CareerOneStop website.
<h3>Other Tips for Adult Students</h3>
Here are some other things to keep in mind if you’re going back to school on a budget:
<h4>1. Transfer your old credits.</h4>
You may have attended classes several years (or even decades) ago. Don’t let those credits go to waste without first contacting your prospective school’s registrar’s office. Ask if the credits are transferable, so you don’t have to take and pay for such classes all over again.
<h4>2. Make sure the school accepts your student aid.</h4>
If you qualify for federal student aid, you want to pick a school that participates in the program. If not, that money will go to waste. You can find this out by contacting the school’s financial aid office.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Convert experience into credits.</h4>
So you haven’t stepped foot on campus in years. So what?
Some schools offer credits for work or life experience that can give you a nice head-start with your restart.

4. Make the most out of military experience.

Many adult students go back to school with military experience under their belts. Military personnel have scholarships and loan repayment assistance at their disposal, which you can find by going <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/military"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

Before making the move, here are some things you should do first to ensure smooth sailing later on.

Have you realized that where you are isn’t where you want to be? If so, there is one move that can change that: Get training to pick up a new skill and start a new career. And contrary to popular belief, there is no age limit to accomplishing this goal.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

How do you transform your dream of starting a new career into reality? Information can help, as it’ll give you clarity. Use the following information to gain that clarity and discover resources that can help you define what you really want to do.
<h4>Look at Different Careers</h4>
You may know which career you want to jump into, or it could be a complete mystery. Either way, there’s a tool from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that can give you greater insight into what each career has to offer: The Occupational Outlook Handbook.

You’ll find a wealth of information at that link. You can go into it completely green if you have no idea what you want to pursue. Simply browse the different occupation groups, see what’s involved in each job and the requirements, and start making a list of potential careers.

If demand motivates you, there’s a section on the highest-paying and fastest-growing jobs.
Pick one of those if you want to ensure job security in the future.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

There’s another government website that’s quite handy for anyone seeking a new career. It comes from the U.S. Department of Education and can point you in the right direction.

You can browse among 900-plus career options in different industries. You can also start from scratch by simply entering some keywords of things you’d like to do, such as “build houses.”

Each career result will give you a wealth of information on what it involves and what it takes to get there. You can also see the average salary and future projections on expected demand.
<h4>What To Do Next</h4>
Both of those tools can help you define what you want to do. Once you figure that out, you can use their detailed information to see the path you’ll need to take to reach that position.

If you see that you’ll need a degree, start looking for schools that match your needs. Unless you have a ton of cash saved up, you’ll probably need financial aid to pay for school or training.

You can get student aid from the government via grants and other funding, which is usually accomplished by filling out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, for which there is no age limit.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Beyond government funding, you can also get help via scholarships. Don’t be afraid to talk to your employer, either, if you’re currently working. They may have a tuition assistance program to help you out.

Even if you have no idea what you want to do, start using the tools listed above. They’re so filled with information, they just might be the spark you need to figure out your future so you can move on to bigger and better things.","Starting a new career can be intimidating and exciting at the same time.

5181,"Common Questions Adult Students May Have About Financial Aid","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If the former describes you, here are some questions you may have regarding financial aid.

You finally decided to go back to school. Whether this is your first time taking college classes or you’re returning to finish up your degree, federal student aid could help cut some of the high costs of getting an education. You may not know how student aid from the government works, though, and as an adult student, you may feel as if you could get left out in the cold. 

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Let’s clear up some questions many in your situation tend to have right now:

<h4>1. How can you get federal student aid?</h4>

Getting student aid from the government is pretty straightforward. It all begins with completing your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which is what many simply call the “FAFSA.”

What’s so special about the FAFSA? The fact that it determines whether or not you have the financial need required to get student aid. If you do, it opens up opportunities from colleges that can send you letters with offers for free money for school.

<h4>2. What’s the age limit for federal student aid?</h4>

The great news is that there is no limit to get federal student aid. In other words, as you fill out your FAFSA, it’s as if you’re a high school student going off to college for the very first time.

Speaking of time, it’s of the essence when it comes to FAFSA submission. In other words, pay attention to those deadlines so you don’t miss them, as tardiness, not age, will keep you from getting federal financial help.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Will a bad credit score keep you from getting federal student aid?</h4>

One thing many adult students have that younger ones don’t is credit history. For some, they’d rather keep that history private if it’s filled with late payments and other damaging marks.

Luckily, most federal student aid programs do not consider credit history. So, complete that FAFSA form, and forget about any bad credit standing in your way.

<h4>4. Can you get federal student aid if you have loans in default?</h4>

They may not care about your credit history too much, but the federal government will see that any student loans you have with them are in order. Since getting out of default can take up to nine months unless you pay off the outstanding amount, you’ll want to fix any federal student loan issues before sending off your FAFSA.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Is there special student aid for single parents?</h4>

As far as the federal government is concerned, no. You could find grants or scholarships for single parents from organizations, however.

If you qualify for federal student aid, you may be able to use some of those funds to help pay for child care. To know for sure, contact your school’s financial aid office. In doing so, they may be able to tell you of other child care opportunities to help you cut costs. For instance, some institutions have on-campus daycare.","Going back to school as an adult can be different from heading to college fresh out of high school.

5184,"Do This To Find Funding For Your Tech School Degree","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Many people get to a point in their lives when they decide it’s time to aim for bigger and better things. They may feel as if there’s no upward movement in their job, causing them to rethink their plans.

They may want to reach higher heights in their field, causing them to seek advanced education. Or, they may simply want to learn a new skill to take a different career path and become a chef, nurse, dental hygienist, mechanic, plumber, etc.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Regardless of the trigger for change, a great way to make it happen is by attending a technical school. Doing so can help you get focused training for the job of your dreams without the general studies that accompany a standard college curriculum. This not only enables you to graduate quicker so you can enter the workforce, but it can also help you save money.

Speaking of money, you may have your sights set on going to tech school, but your budget may not have enough room for those extra expenses. If that’s the case, don’t fret, as you can get funding towards your tech school degree by following these tips:
<h4>Talk To Your Employer</h4>
If you’re happy with the field you're in, but you’d like to move up and get promoted, tech school training could help. Let your employer know your intentions. Ask if the company has a tuition assistance program.

They may see your ambition as a solid investment, and they could help pay for some of your studies so you can become an even more valuable part of the company.

If your employer was the military, the GI Bill could pay for your studies.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Fill Out Your FAFSA</h4>
If you’re not working or your employer doesn’t offer tuition assistance, don’t fret. There is plenty of free money out there, and the best place to start looking for it is with the federal government.

Believe it or not, you don’t have to attend college to qualify for government grants. You don’t have to be a certain age, either. All you have to do is complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to show that you have a financial need.

Filling out this form can open the floodgates for funding your trade school journey. First, it shows the federal government what you qualify for according to financial need. This could make you eligible for the Pell Grant, which offers $6,000-plus per year towards your schooling.

Qualify for a Pell Grant, and you could automatically be eligible for other federal grants, plus offerings from your state.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Does the free money for school end there? No, because once your federal and state options are determined, you can still look for grants and scholarships from the school you’ll attend. Just get in touch with the school’s financial aid office to see what’s at your disposal.

Next up are grants and scholarships from trade organizations and unions. With technical skills in demand, these groups are willing to dish out free money to students looking to jump into the industry. You can find such funding by searching for national organizations in your desired field. Most have websites with sections dedicated to grants and scholarships for tech school students.","You can graduate from a trade school in half the time compared to a traditional college.

Here are some better ways to fund your dream of furthering your education.

You figure now’s the perfect time to go to college or a trade school to get your degree or certificate. Doing so will give you more earning power and the flexibility and freedom that comes with having more money in your pocket.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

There’s just one little problem, though: You’re short on money right now. In other words, paying for any schooling when you’re having trouble paying regular monthly bills seems like a pipe dream.

What do some prospective students see as a quick way out? Getting a personal loan since they’re advertised everywhere and seem easy to get approved for. Since personal loans are usually for lower amounts and carry high interest rates, however, they’re not a reliable solution for funding your education. These options, on the other hand, are not only reliable, but they’re also plentiful:
<h4>1. Aid From the Federal Government</h4>
Uncle Sam can help you pay for some or possibly all of your education. Best of all, you can receive government funding regardless of your age, and even if you’re going to a trade or tech school to become a massage therapist, dental hygienist, electrician, etc.

Where can you find federal student aid? It all begins with completing your <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

The FAFSA form is free to fill out and tell the federal government, state, and schools if you have sufficient financial need. This opens up a wave of opportunities in the form of grants, which are awards that you do not have to pay back.

While completing your FAFSA form is a good start on the grant side of things, you may also want to take a look at federal student loans. Most are easy to qualify for, carry low interest rates, and have flexible repayment options.

The Federal Work-Study program is another way to pay for college with help from the government. You get to gain experience in your field of study while also getting paid so you can pay for your college expenses.
<h4>2. Aid From Your State</h4>
As mentioned, your FAFSA form can help you qualify for college grants from your state. Go <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> to see other funding options to help you get your degree, depending on where you live.
<h4>3. Other Grants and Scholarships</h4>
Are federal and state governments the only way to pay for college without spending your own money? Nope, as you can also search for grants and scholarships from nonprofits, individuals, professional organizations, and more.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Emergency Aid</h4>
A personal loan is often seen as a form of emergency financial aid since it can result in quick cash. But again, it’s not ideal for a college student due to the associated costs.

What’s an alternative? Emergency financial aid for students, which can be found by connecting with your school’s financial aid office. Tell them your situation, and they can point you in the right direction to study without delay.
<h4>5. Employer Tuition Assistance</h4>
Want to move up in your company? Tell your employer you’re looking to advance your education. They may have a program that will help you pay for it to earn that promotion later on.","A personal loan can give you money in a pinch, but high interest rates make it anything but ideal when you need cash for college.

But if you’re close to signing up for school, is going entirely online worth it, or should you do all you can to get on campus? We’ll break it down for you.

As COVID-19 still lingers, many college students find themselves taking classes on the couch instead of the classroom. While they’ll eventually shift back onto campus once everything goes back to normal, some students are opting for the full online route.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Online degrees are nothing new, as they give students the freedom to study while working, taking care of their kids, and more. This flexibility makes them an attractive option for nontraditional students, but are online degrees the same as traditional ones? In other words, would you just be wasting your time and money in trying to get one? Let’s take a closer look.
<h4>Can You Find Work With an Online Degree?</h4>
Why do the great majority of students sign up for school? It’s not just to get a piece of paper that says they graduated. Instead, it’s to get a job that can earn them income and stability in the future.

If a degree can’t get you a job, it’s probably not worth the investment. Earning a degree, whether online or on-campus, however, is never a guarantee of employment.

With that being said, yes, you can get a job with an online degree, just as you can get one if you spent four years on a college campus. It all depends on the industry, the job market, and more. 

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Don’t think that just because a degree is online, however, that you’ll be out of luck when you graduate. That’s a myth, especially now since the entire world is shifting online due to COVID-19.

<h4>Do Online Degrees Garner Respect?</h4>
One reason why some believe you cannot get a job with an online degree is the respect factor. They think that simply because you attended a traditional four-year institution in person, an employer respects that more than online learning. This is not necessarily the case.

Again, online degrees are becoming more mainstream, especially among nontraditional adult students. You can also enroll in an online program from a traditional university, as many have made the virtual shift to meet demand and the changing marketplace.
<h4>Are Online Degrees More Expensive?</h4>
The costs of your studies depend on a variety of factors. Generally, studying online helps you cut some costs associated with traditional college life.

You can reduce transportation costs. Where you live may cost less than housing near or on a college campus. If you have kids, you don’t have to worry about paying a sitter while you go to class, as the course comes to you. You can also continue to work a full-time job and do your online courses wherever they fit into your schedule.

For those reasons, you could say that getting an online degree is a more affordable route than going on campus.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Is Getting an Online Degree Easier Than a Traditional One?</h4>
One could say that an online degree's convenience makes it easier, as it removes stressors like having to go to class and adhering to a schedule. However, when it comes to the actual work, you’ll likely have to invest the same amount of time studying, completing assignments, and virtually participating in activities.","COVID-19 caused many classes, from kindergarten to college, to move online.","2021-07-28 16:49:34",post,https://mammothawards.com/is-an-online-degree-worth-your-time-and-money/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1127449910.jpg,shutterstock_1127449910.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1127449910.jpg,5191,shutterstock_1127449910,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1127449910.jpg,"Work From Home",Education,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,is-an-online-degree-worth-your-time-and-money,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-07-29 14:55:14"

Recent reports state that many people don’t plan on celebrating this holiday season like they usually do. Why?

First, many are trying to play it safe with COVID-19 floating around. Second, many saw their finances ruined by the coronavirus shutdowns. And third, plenty of people are simply tired due to the pandemic, and they want to take it slow into the next year.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Regardless of which group you belong to, it can’t hurt to have extra spending cash for the holidays. But with money so tight, where’s a good place to find it?

Luckily, you don’t have to look very far, as your monthly expenses present plenty of opportunities for savings. Once you see how easy it is to cut costs, you can get that extra cash for Christmas and other holiday celebrations.

Who knows? You may even continue these newfound cost-cutting ways well into the future.’
<h3>The Easiest Costs To Cut for Christmas Cash</h3>
Before we jump into where you can save each month, it’s worth noting we won’t discuss how to cut costs related to big items like your car, rent, or mortgage. The whole goal is to keep it simple so you can see results fast.

With that out of the way, let’s look at where you can easily score some savings without much effort:
<h4>1. Splurging on brand name items.</h4>
Household supplies, certain types of clothes, and groceries all have one thing in common: You can opt for their generic alternatives to get the same effect without spending as much money.

As you start shopping for general items, pick their generic options. You may not get the rush you get from buying that fancy brand name, but you’ll probably see they taste/feel/work the same at a much lower cost.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Buying prepared food.</h4>
Do you hate to cook? You may want to start doing it more often in this quest for extra Christmas cash.

Cooking at home saves a ton of money per meal, so give up restaurants, drive-thrus, delivery, and even prepared food at the store and see how much you save. You’ll be surprised at how much money you’ve been wasting in the name of convenience.
<h4>3. Entertaining yourself.</h4>
Do you have the premium cable lineup? Are your devices filled with subscriptions to every movie and TV service around? Is your mailbox filled with magazine subscriptions, monthly meat delivery, and more? And lastly, do you have a gym membership at a place where you haven’t entered in months?

If so, it’s time to cut back on those entertainment costs to free up some money for the holidays.
You don’t have to eliminate every form of entertainment from your life, but be more selective. In the end, you’ll likely realize you haven’t missed much.

<h4>4. Your cell phone bill.</h4>
When’s the last time you shopped around for cell phone service? The marketplace is continuously changing, and new competitors can bring the same service to the table on the cheap.

Most of us overpay for such service, so don’t feel guilty about leaving your old provider in the dust. The monthly savings will be well worth making the switch.
<h4>5. Being wasteful with utilities.</h4>
It may take a bit of discipline, but you can score substantial savings by being more mindful of how you use utilities in your home. Making simple moves like taking quicker showers, shutting off devices when you’re not using them, and turning off the AC when you leave can make a significant difference.","Where can you find extra cash for Christmas?

Is it President Donald Trump or his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden? We’ll take a look at each candidate’s plans and let you make that decision before it’s time to fill out your ballot.

It seemed like an eternity, but the 2020 presidential election is finally right around the corner. You may have picked your candidate already, or you’re still waiting until the last minute for one to sway your mind.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

When it comes to topics, one crucial point could be housing. Even if you had no issues paying your rent or mortgage before, the COVID-19 pandemic could have changed it all. And now, if you’re facing eventual eviction, you could see housing as that topic that puts one candidate over the top.

Who has your best housing interests at heart? We’ll list each candidate’s plans and let you make the call.
<h4>The Challenger: Joe Biden</h4>
The Biden camp has wasted no time issuing a detailed housing plan, much of which focuses on discrimination, inequities, and accessibility.

The proposed funding in Joe Biden’s housing plans is quite large. It starts with a $640 billion investment, scheduled over 10 years, that would make sure all Americans have access to housing that is safe, energy-efficient, close to schools and jobs, and most importantly, affordable.

One aspect of housing that isn’t affordable for many is a down payment on a new home. Biden would address this with a $15,000 tax credit to eliminate that out-of-pocket obstacle for first-time homebuyers. Service workers, such as first responders, teachers, etc., would also get down payment assistance and discounts on home prices.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

High-cost loans and predatory lenders would be tackled by a new Homeowner and Renter Bill of Rights. Credit scoring would be tweaked to include utility and rent payments to address racial gaps. Also, the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation from the Obama administration, which Trump shut down, would be reinstated.

Other highlights of Biden’s housing proposal include a $100 billion investment in affordable housing development, a $10 billion investment to increase home energy efficiency, and a $13 billion investment in the fight against homelessness.

<h4>The Incumbent: Donald Trump</h4>
President Trump’s housing plan relies less on future proposals and more on his record. As mentioned, he eliminated the AFFH, which addressed housing discrimination, as a way to keep suburbs as-is without injecting affordable housing into existing communities.

While that move could be seen as a negative mark against Trump for some, he did use the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2017 to create “opportunity zones.” These zones were his way of increasing affordable housing and creating employment opportunities.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) lost its ability to go after lenders for discrimination under Trump. This, combined with ending the AFFH, make some question his commitment to affordable housing.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

COVID-19 made affordable housing an issue for those who had never been affected by it. To address this, President Trump moved to ban evictions during the pandemic through an executive order. He also urged the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help those unable to pay their rent or mortgage due to the coronavirus shutdowns' financial difficulties.","On the topic of housing, who deserves your vote more?","2020-10-22 16:21:56",post,https://mammothawards.com/?p=5196,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1766199932.jpg,shutterstock_1766199932.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1766199932.jpg,5197,shutterstock_1766199932,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1766199932.jpg,Housing,,draft,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,trump-or-biden-who-has-your-housing-interests-at-heart,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 18:19:14"

Think of your options when you can’t pay the rent. In other words, what can you do to make sure this rent gets paid, and you avoid being late in the months to come?

For most people, here’s a list of solutions they’ll come up with:
<ul>
 	<li>Ask for more hours at work.</li>
 	<li>Get a second job.</li>
 	<li>Work a side gig.</li>
 	<li>Sell your stuff for quick cash.</li>
 	<li>Write a late rent hardship letter to the landlord.</li>
 	<li>Get a loan.</li>
 	<li>Ask for help from friends and family.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Can all of those moves help you pay the rent? Sure, but many are temporary fixes, or they may not be available to you at all.

What’s a solution that’s not on that list? Getting rent assistance via the government, and there are many ways to do so, which we’ll discuss now.
<h4>1. Contact your state’s housing finance agency.</h4>
You may be able to get local rent help from your state. Each has its own housing finance agency, and you can find yours by going <a href=""https://www.ncsha.org/housing-help/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.
<h4>2. Contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA).</h4>
If you’ve finally had enough and want a long-term solution to your rent-paying problem, touching base with <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">your nearest PHA</a> may be your best bet.

A PHA can help you apply for a Section 8 housing voucher, which can greatly reduce your rent and let you move into an affordable townhome, apartment, or single-family home.
They can also help you find public housing that’s cheap and safe as well.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

While these rent assistance programs are usually long-term solutions that can take a while to put into action, you can ask your PHA if they know of any forms of immediate help too.
<h4>3. Contact your state social service agency.</h4>
This agency type can help you with housing and many other types of assistance that you may need due to a lack of income. It may be your best option for emergency rent assistance, as they should know what’s available locally for people who are close to eviction.

To find your closest state social service agency, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">go here</a>.

It’s worth noting that if any of these options cannot help you directly, you should always ask if they can connect you to someone who can. Many are experts in rent assistance and know of local nonprofit organizations that can chip in to lend a helping hand.

5206,"What You Need To Know When Applying For Section 8","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You can greatly reduce how much you pay in rent if you qualify for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. With it, you’ll only have to pay a certain amount of your income towards rent each month, allowing you to start putting away cash for a rainy day.

Are Section 8 vouchers available to everyone? Unfortunately, the answer is no, as the program was created to help low-income families in need. To see if you may qualify, keep reading, as we’ll explain the application process and what will be expected of you.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How a Section 8 Voucher Helps</h4>
Before you apply for a Housing Choice Voucher, you’re probably wondering how it can help you. As stated, it limits how much you’ll have to pay out of pocket for rent, with the government picking up the rest of the tab.

This is ideal if you have problems paying your rent on time every month and if you feel like you’re constantly on the brink of eviction. Besides the peace of mind that a housing voucher provides, it can also allow you to start saving your money until you can become completely independent of any assistance.

Even though Section 8 assistance comes from the government, it won’t limit your housing options. As long as the property participates in the Section 8 program, you can choose between a single-family home, apartment, or townhome.
<h4>How To Become Eligible for Section 8</h4>
In an ideal world, we all could qualify for a housing voucher to make rent more affordable. However, that’s not the case, as several factors will be used to determine whether or not you can get Section 8 help.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) will be in charge of your application and granting any vouchers. To see if you are eligible, they will look at the following:
<ul>
 	<li>The size of your family.</li>
 	<li>The status of your citizenship.</li>
 	<li>Your status as a senior citizen, someone with a disability, or as a low-income family.</li>
 	<li>How much you make each year (gross annual income).</li>
 	<li>Other factors, depending on the PHA.</li>
</ul>
As a general rule, the income of everyone in your household will have to be less than 50 percent of the median income where you live. If you make much more than that, you probably will not be eligible for Section 8, as it’s mostly based on financial need.
<h4>How To Apply for Section 8</h4>
It’s a good idea to get started with your Section 8 application now. Wait times for vouchers can be quite long due to demand, so the sooner you start, the better.

To get started, contact your PHA. They will tell you what’s needed to apply for Section 8, including any documents and information regarding your family size, citizenship, income, etc.

You can fill out your Section 8 application or have a PHA counselor help with the process. Know that the PHA will check any information on your application to verify that it’s true. The information, such as income and family size, will also be used to determine how much your potential voucher could be worth.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

If you qualify for a voucher, you will be moved to a waiting list. Once your spot in the list comes up, you can get a voucher to help pay the rent of a property that meets Section 8’s health and safety standards.

The property will be inspected, and if it’s approved, you can move in. Your voucher will be paid straight to the landlord every month, and you’ll have to pay your portion on time.","A Section 8 housing voucher can make it much easier to manage your expenses. Not everyone can get a voucher, though, so you’ll need to keep a few things in mind when you apply.","2020-12-11 15:32:04",post,https://mammothawards.com/what-you-need-to-know-when-applying-for-section-8/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_649365181.jpg,shutterstock_649365181.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_649365181.jpg,5207,shutterstock_649365181,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_649365181.jpg,Housing,,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,what-you-need-to-know-when-applying-for-section-8,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-11 16:59:11"
5209,"How Much Rent Must You Pay For Section 8 Housing?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

We’ll answer that and provide more insight into how Section 8 works so you can begin the application process soon.

If you cut your rent costs, think of what you could do with those extra savings. You could use them to pay down credit cards and other debt.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

You could save up and build your emergency fund, so you don’t go into deep debt if something unexpected happens. You could also start saving for a new car or home.

Unfortunately, many feel that cutting rent costs involves downgrading where you live or having roommates.

That’s simply not the case, though, as the Section 8 program can reduce your rent so you can start working towards goals like those listed above.
<h4>What You’ll Pay for Rent Under the Section 8 Program</h4>
Section 8 housing vouchers may make rent less costly, but they won’t necessarily make it free. The amount of rent you’ll pay will be based on your income.

This usually amounts to 30 percent of your monthly income, with the government picking up the rest of the tab.

As an example, let’s say you make $2,000 per month. The apartment you want to rent costs $1,000 per month.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

With a Section 8 voucher, you’ll pay $600 per month in rent (30 percent of $2,000). The government, meanwhile, will pay the remaining $400 each month directly to your landlord.

Keep in mind that the property you want to rent must fall in line with the “Fair Market Rent” established by the HUD.

In other words, it must be considered affordable for the area, so you won’t be able to pick a luxury apartment with the hopes of the government paying for any excess rent costs.

In the example above, you can count on your voucher paying that $400 remainder of the rent, provided that the Fair Market Rent for the area is equal to or greater than $1,000.

What happens if the property you pick is more expensive? You’ll be responsible for paying the difference, in addition to the 30 percent of your income.

As you can see, Section 8 can provide quite the rent relief if you’re used to paying half of your income to your landlord every month. What’s the downside of the program? Its demand, which is quite high since it’s so beneficial.

It’s not unusual for a Section 8 waiting list to last years. This is why you should apply for Section 8 now if you’ve been seeking rental assistance, as your wait may be very long.

To begin the application process, contact your local Public Housing Agency. If you need affordable rent soon, ask them how to get it.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

For example, they may suggest you seek Section 8 housing in a different area than where you currently live due to lower demand.

You can also ask about any preferences that can move you up a waiting list faster, such as being homeless, living in substandard housing, or being disabled.","Section 8 offers vouchers that can certainly make housing more affordable, but how much will you end up paying out of pocket?

5213,"How To Prep For Homelessness (And Get Out Of It ASAP)","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Nobody ever imagines themselves living on the streets, but it’s a reality for many. What’s most important if you become homeless is to figure your way out of it as quickly as possible, which is what this quick guide will help you do.
<h3>Prepping for Homelessness</h3>
You lost your job. While looking for another one, your savings ran out. Paying rent became impossible, and although you talked to your landlord, they’re no longer letting you stay on their property for free.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What comes next? Unless you can pay your landlord quickly, it’s eviction. And once you’re formally evicted, the streets may become your new home.

Just thinking about the prospects of being homeless is enough to make anyone feel sick. But you can make it less daunting and dreadful if you prepare for the transition. Here are some steps to do just that:
<h4>1. Get your ID in order.</h4>
Believe it or not, many people lack ID or have a license or some other form of identification that’s expired. Why is this a no-no if you’re about to become homeless? Because many homeless shelters and assistance programs require proper ID. Without it, you may be literally left out in the cold.

Instead of getting rejected when you show up at a shelter, get your ID or have it renewed before it’s too late.
<h4>2. Find a place to put all of your stuff.</h4>
If you think a homeless shelter will let you move in with all of your belongings, think again. Most have limited space, which means they’ll limit what you can bring.

Unless you want to lose your possessions, arrange with friends or family to store them for a while. You could also get a storage unit, although that will come with a cost.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Pack a bag.</h4>
You and each family member should have their own bag with necessities like any essential documents and medications.
<h4>4. Don’t forget your mail.</h4>
Becoming homeless doesn’t mean your mail will stop coming. You’ll want to ask your post office to forward it elsewhere, or see if they have a program for the homeless that’ll keep your mail in a safe spot.
<h3>Once You’re Homeless</h3>
As soon as homelessness becomes a reality, your next step is to do everything you can to end it. Your best bet for doing so temporarily is to find a homeless shelter, which you can do by visiting <a href=""https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this massive online directory</a>.

Your local social services agency may help, so contact them as well by going <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>. Lastly, you may <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/topics/homelessness/localassist"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">find local homeless assistance</a> through the HUD.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

As for what to expect from a homeless shelter, many will be free, but some may charge a minimal fee. If you need rehab services, be sure to ask beforehand. You can get help paying for those services via Medicaid or payment plans according to income.

While a shelter will help you once you become homeless, don’t forget about making this move to get back on your feet: Apply for low-income housing assistance from the government. You can do so by <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/finding-home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">going here</a> and applying for Section 8 or other assistance programs.","If you’re close to being homeless, fear and confusion may be clouding your mind.

You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who wouldn’t want to pay less for rent each month, as doing so would free up money for other expenses.

What’s one way to pay less rent? Besides downgrading where you live or sharing your payment with a roommate, it’s getting a Section 8 housing voucher.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

With a voucher in place, you can lower your rental cost and get that much-needed wiggle room in your budget. But is Section 8 for everyone?
No, and we’ll take a look at if it’s right for you now.
<h4>1. Do you make too much income?</h4>
In an ideal world, everyone would get a Section 8 voucher to reduce their rent. Such is not the case, however, as the program was made with low-income households in mind.

If you make too much money, which is usually more than 50 percent of the area median income, then Section 8 is not right for you, as you will not qualify.
<h4>2. Do you have proper citizenship?</h4>
Besides meeting the income requirements, Section 8 requires that you be a citizen or a non-citizen with legal immigration status. You may qualify, however, if some people in your household meet the citizenship requirement.

In such a case, you can receive a prorated amount for your housing voucher.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Do you want flexibility in picking your home?</h4>
Here’s where Section 8 meets many people’s needs, as it’s more flexible than other housing assistance programs. With Section 8, you can pick where you live as long as the property is in line with the Fair Market Rent for the area, and it meets certain safety standards.

What does this mean for you? That you can look around for affordable housing in the form of a townhome, apartment, or single-family home. If the landlord accepts Section 8 vouchers and the rent isn’t excessively high, you should be good to go.
<h4>4. Do you have time to wait?</h4>
Some people need help with getting affordable housing right away. Is Section 8 a form of emergency rent assistance? Unfortunately, no, and that’s due to its extremely high demand.

Simply put, more people need Section 8 than there are available vouchers. Even if you qualify for Section 8, you will be put on a waiting list. Depending on where you want to live, you could be sitting on that waiting list for years.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

If your housing situation is suitable now, but you want to make it more affordable in the future, then Section 8 could be just what the doctor ordered. If you’ve just been evicted and are living on the streets, however, you may want to look for emergency housing assistance via shelters. Then, once you get situated, you can apply for Section 8 to make your housing future more certain.

5226,"4 Sites That Help You Find The Best Online Deals","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Is it easier to save money when shopping on the Internet versus in person? Yes, and you can attribute that to the power of online search.

In a matter of seconds, you can easily search for the exact item you want. You can then use the search results to see which retailer offers it at the lowest price.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Is this form of manual searching the only way to find the best online deals? No, as there are now many sites, apps, and extensions that will do the legwork for you, so you can sit back and save.

Here are some of the best of the bunch that you should start using before you make your next online purchase:
<h4>1. Honey</h4>
Do you frequently shop on Amazon.com? If so, the Honey app can help you track when an item drops to its lowest price and send you an alert so you can snag it.

This feature is great if you have the patience to wait for the lowest price on a product, but if you want to make a purchase now, Honey can also help.

When you check out, Honey will scan the Internet for any coupon codes that could be applied to your product. It will test to find one that works, and they apply those savings, so you don’t pay the full price.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Slickdeals</h4>
While finding online deals via digital coupon codes is rather simple, there is one problem: Many coupon codes don’t work, and some could be scams. How can you overcome this? By finding coupon codes via the Slickdeals site.

Slickdeals has a huge following, and its members chime in on which coupon codes and deals are legit and aren’t. This can help you avoid scams and see all of the deals that are out there to save with ease.

If you don’t have much time to participate in the online chatter, you can also use Slickdeals to set up alerts for items that may interest you. When a deal comes through, you’ll be notified so you can take advantage of it before it’s too late.
<h4>3. CouponCabin</h4>
Coupon codes and online sales aren’t the only ways to save money when shopping online, as cash back is another method. With CouponCabin, you can still find coupon codes, discounts, and the like, but you can also get cash back on purchases to start stacking savings.

Cash back is a great way to cut your costs, as it basically pays you to shop. With CouponCabin, you can see which retailers are offering the biggest cash back bonuses so you can get them while they’re still good.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. CouponFollow</h4>
Do you want to see if your favorite store is offering any coupons? You can do so by searching via CouponFollow. And if you want an easier way to find deals, download the site’s Cently app. It works on the Chrome browser and applies coupon codes at checkout, so you don’t have to do a thing.","There’s no need to search manually for the best online deals, as here are four sites that will do all of the work for you.","2020-12-17 19:09:22",post,https://mammothawards.com/4-sites-that-help-you-find-the-best-online-deals/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_520843114.jpg,shutterstock_520843114.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_520843114.jpg,5227,shutterstock_520843114,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_520843114.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,4-sites-that-help-you-find-the-best-online-deals,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-27 21:53:08"

<h4>PriceBlink</h4>
The days of spending hours or days hunting for deals are now over, thanks to the Internet. And if you want one of the best extensions to find the lowest prices, it’s tough to beat PriceBlink. Why? Because it scans over 11,000 sites to pinpoint the best deals.

The savings don’t stop there, though, as you can also use PriceBlink to find digital coupons to lower the price of that desired product even more.
<h4>Capital One Shopping</h4>
While Honey is tough to top when it comes to offering multiple ways to save, Capital One Shopping isn’t far behind. Formerly called Wikibuy, this app is ideal for frequent Amazon shoppers.

If you’re browsing an item on Amazon, Capital One Shopping will instantly search for the best prices among Amazon sellers and other online retailers. To help you make your buying decision, it will also display reviews of the product from multiple sources.

After picking the product at its lowest price, the browser extension helps you save yet again by searching for coupon codes. Once you make your purchase, you can accumulate rewards credits that can be redeemed later on for gift cards either for yourself or your loved ones.

Does Capital One Shopping only work when making a purchase? No, as it’ll notify you when a product’s price drops in the future, even if you don’t decide to buy just yet.

<h4>CouponCabin Sidekick</h4>
When it comes to saving money when shopping on the Internet, coupon codes are extremely popular. Not only are they easy to use, but they usually result in significant savings.

5232,"5 Sites To Sell Your Used Stuff Online","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The holidays are almost upon us, and that likely means one thing: You wish you had more money in your bank account to buy gifts, decorate, travel, etc.

Such a wish is even more likely to be true in 2020 since COVID-19 wiped out many people’s finances. But instead of waiting on another stimulus, do this: Sell your used stuff for cash.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

In the past, many relied on garage sales or word of mouth to make a profit. And while you can still use that old fashioned method, here’s an even better way to get money in your hands quickly: Sell your things online.

Some people make a full-time income selling things online. The money is there; you just have to know where to look. And even if you don’t need a full-time income since you’re working, it’s good to know your holiday budget can get a boost by merely decluttering your house.

Here are some of the best sites for selling used stuff online:
<h4>1. Craigslist</h4>
This massive online classifieds site is where many local people turn to get great deals on used stuff. Under the “for sale” section, you’ll find tons of categories, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Antiques</li>
 	<li>Appliances</li>
 	<li>Bikes</li>
 	<li>Books</li>
 	<li>Cell phones</li>
 	<li>Computers</li>
 	<li>Jewelry</li>
 	<li>Tools</li>
 	<li>Toys</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
With so much traffic, the chances of someone seeing your item and wanting to buy it are high. For safety reasons, make sure you meet in a public area when making the sale.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Facebook Marketplace</h4>
A “new age” way to sell your used items via word of mouth is through your Facebook profile. But did you know that Facebook has an online marketplace too?

It sure does, and many use it to unload their items quickly to local sellers. As with Craigslist or any other site where you post things online and meet up to sell them, pick a safe spot to make the transaction.
<h4>3. eBay</h4>
If you want to expand your reach and sell to buyers worldwide, eBay is a solid choice. The site gets loads of traffic due to its popularity over the years, and you can find buyers rather quickly, no matter what the item.
<h4>4. OfferUp</h4>
This app just merged with another popular one in the e-commerce space called LetGo. You can post items in as little as 30 seconds and see if you get any bites from buyers nearby.

Don’t be shy about what you post, either. A quick look at the Miami OfferUp shows recent listings for an old car hood, a used food chopper, used headphones, and even wigs.

While these sites work wonders at getting quick cash for your clutter, be sure to read their policies on restricted or prohibited items. You don’t want to get banned for selling something that’s not permitted, which will hinder your ability to earn extra income.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Decluttr</h4>
What’s one thing that could keep you from selling used items online? Not wanting to list everything separately and having to deal with buyers.

If this is the case, try Decluttr. Just box up all your unwanted stuff, Decluttr will send you an offer, and, if you accept, you ship it to them and get paid once it arrives.","A quick way to come up with cash for Christmas is to sell things collecting dust around your home.

5235,"See When And How To Make The Most Of Medicare Open Enrollment","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What’s most important to you? During your earlier years, things like your looks and making money may have been at the top of the list. As time passed, family probably became your priority. And now, as you age, your health may have become king.

Having sufficient healthcare coverage is essential regardless of age, but if you have a disability or are a senior, it becomes even more crucial. Medicare can provide that coverage you need, but health doesn’t tend to stay the same.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

For instance, this year, you may have found that you need to see new doctors or specialists. You may need new treatments. Or you may need new prescriptions to fix issues that have appeared in 2020. Before 2021 rolls around, you want to ensure your Medicare plan matches those new needs, and the current Open Enrollment Period (OEP) is the perfect time to complete that task.

If open enrollment is new to you, keep reading so you can learn how it works, and take advantage of it before the period ends.
<h4>Open Enrollment’s Primary Purpose</h4>
We have Medicare Open Enrollment for one major reason: To give enrollees a chance to review and revamp their plans.

If you’re enrolled in Medicare, you should have received an Annual Notice of Change. In it, you can see what 2021 has in store for your plan in terms of any differences. If those differences don’t affect you much, you can keep your plan. Or you can use open enrollment to look around and find a better fit.
<h4>How Open Enrollment Functions</h4>
You have between October 15 to December 7 each year to participate in the OEP. This means that before December 7 hits, you’ll need to:
<ol>
 	<li>Review your current plan.</li>
 	<li>Determine that it fits your needs in terms of providers, services, costs, drugs, etc.</li>
 	<li>Shop for and compare new plans.</li>
 	<li>Pick your new plan.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

You can shop for new plans using the <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">official Medicare website</a>. If you find one that seems ideal, you can join it during open enrollment. By joining the new plan, any old plan gets dropped. Once January 1 of the next year hits, that new plan you picked becomes active.
<h4>The Benefits of Using Open Enrollment</h4>
As mentioned, your healthcare needs may have changed, making your current Medicare plan less than ideal. With open enrollment, you can change it to:
<ul>
 	<li>Better cover prescription costs.</li>
 	<li>Fit your budget.</li>
 	<li>Add convenience via more in-network providers.</li>
 	<li>And so on.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ways to Use Open Enrollment</h4>
You’ll have numerous options at your disposal for ensuring your coverage fits your needs, as the OEP allows you to:
<ul>
 	<li>Enroll in Medicare Advantage or a Part D plan for your very first time.</li>
 	<li>Switch from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare Parts A and B, and vice versa.</li>
 	<li>Switch between or drop Part D plans.</li>
 	<li>Switch between Advantage plans.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

The OEP will not, however, allow you to make any moves with Medigap plans. The optimal time for getting one of those is within six months of first becoming eligible for Medicare. During that time, you can get the best price and get approved with ease instead of later on when Medigap prices increase, and acceptance becomes trickier.","If you have Medicare, now’s the time to take a closer look at your plan. Open enrollment is here, and we’ll tell you how to make the most of it.","2020-12-18 17:48:25",post,https://mammothawards.com/see-when-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-medicare-open-enrollment/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_556142068.jpg,shutterstock_556142068.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_556142068.jpg,5236,shutterstock_556142068,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_556142068.jpg,Uncategorized,"Health Care",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,see-when-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-medicare-open-enrollment,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:58:10"

Section 8 is an option, but if you don’t know how it works, you may never take advantage of its helpful vouchers. We’ll explain the application process so you can make affordable rent a reality soon.

When it comes to reducing your rent so you can finally start saving money for an emergency fund or other purposes, your options may seem slim. You may feel like you’re all alone and that the only ways to make things better are to:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Get a higher-paying job.</li>
 	<li>Work extra hours.</li>
 	<li>Get a second job.</li>
 	<li>Work a side gig.</li>
 	<li>Sell some of your stuff.</li>
 	<li>Get a loan from friends or family.</li>
 	<li>Downgrade to a less desirable living situation.</li>
</ul>
None of those options are necessarily easy, and the last one may be downright dangerous, especially if you have a family to protect.

What’s an option not listed above that could be your best bet for cheaper rent? A housing voucher from the Section 8 program. How can it reduce your rent? By paying a portion of it every month, so you only have to pay the remainder.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

If this sounds too good to be true, it’s not, as Section 8 is a popular government assistance program that’s been around for years. To help you see how it works so you can hopefully participate, here are some Section 8 basics worth knowing:
<h4>1. You have to qualify for a voucher based on several factors.</h4>
Section 8 was created to help low-income applicants meet their housing needs. As such, several factors are used to determine who is approved for a voucher, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Citizenship</li>
 	<li>Income</li>
 	<li>Family size</li>
</ul>
Your household can only bring in a certain amount of income to qualify for Section 8. This is often less than 50 percent of the median income for the area.
<h4>2. A Public Housing Agency (PHA) will analyze your eligibility.</h4>
The PHA is who you’ll apply through, and they’ll also verify your information to decide on your eligibility for a voucher.

For this reason, it’s a good idea to discover your PHA now by going <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and contacting them as soon as possible to begin your Section 8 application.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Section 8 vouchers take time.</h4>
If you need extra motivation to contact your PHA now, let it be this: A voucher may take years to process.

Section 8 is extremely popular since it makes rent so affordable. That’s why it’s not uncommon for a waiting list to take years to complete. Keep this in mind if you’ve been putting off your Section 8 application for a while now. The sooner you start, the quicker you can enjoy reduced rent.
<h4>4. Section 8 vouchers offer flexibility.</h4>
Have you avoided Section 8 because you think it forces you to live in a government building? If so, know that such is not the case.

In fact, you can pick the property, which can result in you moving into an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. As long as it meets Section 8 standards, you’ll be good to go.","You’d love to pay less rent each month, but you’re probably unsure of how to make it happen.","2020-12-22 20:10:13",post,https://mammothawards.com/unsure-about-section-8-heres-how-it-works/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1711639381.jpg,shutterstock_1711639381.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1711639381.jpg,5241,shutterstock_1711639381,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1711639381.jpg,Housing,,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,unsure-about-section-8-heres-how-it-works,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-27 21:52:59"

We’ll reveal some overlooked money-making methods that could give your bank account the big boost it needs.

How hard is it to <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/the-5-best-places-to-find-data-entry-work/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">make an additional income</a> without getting a second job? Not very hard, as the Internet can connect you with potential clients almost instantly. Plus, you can use it to find some rather unusual money-making opportunities that may have never crossed your mind.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

While you’re probably familiar with standard side gigs like driving for Uber, tutoring, or babysitting, here are some odd jobs that may interest you a lot more:
<h4>1. Buy low, sell high.</h4>
An easy and quick way to earn extra cash is to sell your used stuff online. But what if you have nothing you want to sell? If that’s the case, you can sell other people’s stuff that you find for free to earn a nice profit.

Some call this money-making method “Craigslist Arbitrage.” It involves going on the Craigslist website and browsing their free section. You pick up items that people are giving away for free, and you repost them with a price. Once it sells to another Craigslist user, you pocket the difference.

If you get really good at this side gig, it could become so profitable that you decide to do it full time. All you need is some space to store the stuff, and you’re good to go.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Turn your car into a moving billboard.</h4>
Have you ever seen standard-sized cars on the road that are coated in advertisements? You may think the drivers are the actual business owners, but they could be people using their cars to make a bit of extra money.

Wrapify is a company that hires people to wrap their cars in business ads. In return, they pay them to showcase the ads around town.

How much can you make by doing this? Wrapify claims the average user brings in just under $500 per month, which is a decent chunk of change for doing little work.
<h4>3. Make the most of unused space in your home.</h4>
Do you have empty closets in your home, or maybe a spare room? Are one of your parking spaces unoccupied? Is your garage doing nothing but collecting dust? If you answered yes to any of those questions, you could put that unused space to use by renting it out to others who need to store their stuff.

Neighbor is one website that offers this money-making capability, and they claim you can make around $2,500 per year by doing it.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Rent out baby supplies you no longer use.</h4>
Raising a baby can be quite expensive, which is why many parents have started renting baby supplies instead of buying them brand new. They don’t necessarily rent them from stores, either, as everyday people are now becoming their suppliers.

Take the site BabyQuip, for example. It lets you rent and deliver baby gear to other parents for a price. Once they’re done, you pick up your stuff and rent it to someone else, all while earning extra money for your time.","There are so many ways to make extra income that it’s easy to overlook some of them.

What do many people do as soon as they win the lottery? They buy a house to stop throwing away money on rent and finally have a roof over their heads that they can call their own.

Does this mean you’ll need to win the lottery to do the same? Not at all. In fact, thanks to programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, you can buy a home with little savings and a low income. Let’s take a look at some of those programs now.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Homeownership Voucher Program</h4>
If you want proof that you can even live in public housing and soon own a home, look no further than the Homeownership Voucher Program. If it sounds similar to the HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher Program or Section 8, the money-saving concept is the same. But instead of helping you pay the rent, a voucher, in this case, will help you pay some of your mortgage and other housing costs.
<h4>FHA Loans</h4>
Have you been rejected for a home loan before? If so, look into an FHA loan from the Federal Housing Administration. It may give you the financing you need if your credit score is low and you don’t have significant savings for a down payment or closing costs.
<h4>HUD Homes</h4>
Did you know that the HUD buys homes? It does whenever a person defaults on an FHA loan. By paying the remainder of the loan, the HUD takes ownership of that property.
Once complete, the property becomes a HUD home.

Instead of sitting on the home as an investment, the HUD puts it on the market at a low price.
This alone makes owning a home more affordable, but HUD homes can also feature low down payments and inexpensive closing costs through some of the programs we’re about to discuss.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>One Dollar Program</h4>
Imagine being able to buy a home for $1. If it sounds too good to be true, know that it’s an actual HUD program.

If you qualify as a family with low or moderate income, you could buy a HUD home for $1, provided it’s been on the market for at least six months.
<h4>HUD $100 Down Program</h4>
Expensive down payments are major obstacles for many aspiring homeowners. With this program, you could end up with a down payment of only $100, which is a far cry from 3.5 percent or more of the purchase price that’s usually required.
<h4>Non-Profit Program</h4>
Non-profit organizations sometimes buy HUD homes at a 30 percent discount under this program. This allows them to repair the homes and sell them at an affordable price to families in need.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Good Neighbor Next Door Program</h4>
Would you like to buy a home at a 50 percent discount? Through this program, it’s a possibility if you are a teacher, firefighter, police officer, or some other form of a public servant.","You don’t have to be sitting on a ton of cash to buy a home, as the HUD has several programs that can make your home-buying dreams come true.","2021-05-26 05:25:46",post,https://mammothawards.com/lack-money-to-buy-a-home-let-these-hud-programs-help-you/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1699379344.jpg,shutterstock_1699379344.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1699379344.jpg,5247,shutterstock_1699379344,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1699379344.jpg,Resources,,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,lack-money-to-buy-a-home-let-these-hud-programs-help-you,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:02:25"
5249,"5 Discounts That Can Save You A Ton On Car Insurance","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Are you satisfied with your monthly car payment? You may be, even if it’s a bit more than you can afford. Why? Because cars are often forms of enjoyment and entertainment that you sometimes can’t put a price on.

What about your car insurance, though? You’re probably not satisfied with it, as you don’t get to “enjoy” insurance every day. And in many cases, insurance may never get used if you don’t get into an accident.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Even if you never use it, you’ll still need to have insurance to keep your beloved vehicle on the road. And while that monthly premium that takes cash out of your bank account may be a bummer, these discounts can make it more manageable:
<h4>1. Paying ahead of time.</h4>
Did you know that your insurance company could reward you for paying your premiums ahead of time? They definitely can, which is why you should do so if you can afford it.

It may not feel great dishing out six months or a year’s worth of car insurance payments at once, but doing so could lead to 15 percent savings, depending on the carrier.
<h4>2. Buying a safe and secure car.</h4>
When you shop for a car, you may look for a certain color or model. But if you overlook the car’s safety features, it could end up in a higher insurance payment.

The safer your car, the better. And if you need an example of how much of a difference safety features can make, have a look: Geico has offered 40 percent discounts for full-front-seat airbags in the past.

If you own an older car, look into what improvements you can make to boost its safety rating or security. Something as simple as adding an alarm could slash your premium.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Becoming a better driver.</h4>
Taking a defensive driving course should be at the top of your list if you’re looking to pay less for insurance. It doesn’t cost a lot nor take a lot of time, and your insurance company can reward you for your work by reducing your premium.

Will any class suffice? Not necessarily, which is why confirming which classes your insurance company approves is a must. You can do this by giving your agent a call before signing up for anything.
<h4>4. Being a good student.</h4>
Are you worried about excessively high car insurance rates for your teens? If so, tell them to do their best at school, as they could be of big help. How?
By getting discounts for good grades.

State Farm has a 25 percent discount for good grades, which translates into huge savings when you consider how expensive it can be to insure young drivers.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Bundle your coverage.</h4>
You can save time and money by bundling coverage for your home, car, etc., with one company. Farmers has offered a 22 percent bundling discount, which can save you a nice chunk of change.","A lower car insurance payment means more money for other expenses.

Many people have opened their eyes to the benefits of working from home, especially this year, when many were forced to do so. What benefits does working at home offer versus a traditional job?

First, you get more control over your schedule. Second, you can cut transportation and food costs since you’ll be in the comfort of your home. And third, you can save a ton on childcare costs if you have kids, while also having more time to spend with them.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you’ve never worked at home before and are looking for online work, you may be wondering how to find a job if you have no experience. And while there are plenty of routes you can take to start working online, one of the best for beginners is data entry.

Can data entry be dull work? Sure, as you may find it repetitive. But if you’re looking to build an online work resume so you can move up the ladder, it’s not a bad place to start.

Where can you find data entry opportunities? Here are some of the bigger names in the business that you can contact to see what they’re looking for:
<h4>1. Lionbridge</h4>
We begin the list with one of the most trusted names around, as Lionbridge has been in the data entry business for 20-plus years.

Some of the tasks Lionbridge workers complete include the transcription of audio and images and converting written documents into digital formats. How much can you earn for doing such work? If you work with Lionbridge, you could reach $14 per hour.

<h4>2. Working Solutions</h4>
Speaking of hourly wages, Working Solutions boasts some impressive numbers there, as their top agents bring in 30 bucks per hour.

This is not to say that you’ll make the same as soon as you start, as you’ll probably need experience to reach that point. With Working Solutions, you can get that experience while working on projects for Microsoft, T-Mobile, TurboTax, and others.
<h4>3. Appen</h4>
The basic requirements to work for Appen are as follows: 1. Be at least 18 years of age. 2. Have a computer with antivirus protection.

If you meet those two requirements, you could start gaining data entry experience with Appen via social media evaluation, transcription, and more.

4. DionData Solutions

If you’re a fast typer and know your way around the Internet, DionData may be your best bet. They don’t necessarily require data entry experience if you have those aforementioned skills.

<h4>5. Clickworker</h4>
While some of the companies in this list may look for a bit of experience from applicants, you could get hired by Clickworker without any. Before reaching that point, you’ll have to show you have basic data entry skills by completing tests. Pass those tests, and you could start your data entry career sooner than you imagined.","If you’d like to start working at home, data entry might be a good place to begin your online journey.

5260,"3 Easy Tips To Get More Scholarships","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

With the power of the Internet at the tip of your fingers, it’s easier than ever to find scholarships that can help you pay for school. But as you begin your search, you may realize something: There are a lot of scholarships out there, which can make your quest for free money rather daunting.

Can searching for scholarships be a time-consuming process? Of course, but you should see that as a good thing, as it means there are plenty of opportunities to reduce your costs. Keeping this in mind, here are three tips to make the most out of your search and ensure you don’t miss out on anything good.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Never stop searching.</h4>
Some people make the mistake of only looking for scholarships before they start school.
And after they get a few, they feel satisfied. While you’re free to do the same, this is not how you max out your scholarship money.

Scholarships vary in terms of when you can use them. Some are intended for seniors coming out of high school. Others are made specifically for adult students. And they even have some scholarships that kids in kindergarten can get many years before they’ll step foot on a college campus.

What’s the moral of the story? Never stop searching for scholarships until you graduate and have that degree in your hands. Make it a habit to search for scholarships every semester so you can see what’s out there. You’d be surprised at how much free money you can pick up to make each year of schooling more affordable.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Look for scholarships beyond your specific field.</h4>
When you first start looking for college scholarships, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. They have scholarships for everything under the sun, meaning that you could take a ton of time to sift through them all.

How can you filter out your results? By searching for scholarships in your field. For example, you could search for “marketing scholarships” with the hopes of getting fewer results but more relevant options to look over. While that’s fine, doing so could limit your opportunities, which is why you should look for awards linked to your field of study.

So, if you’re planning on getting your marketing degree, also search for “business scholarships” or any other term that could relate to marketing. Doing so will increase your chances of finding free money for school.
<h4>3. Read the fine print.</h4>
Scholarship names can sometimes be deceiving. If you only look at an award’s title, you could be missing out.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

A perfect example is the AES Engineering Scholarship. On the surface, it looks like a scholarship for someone in the engineering field. A closer look, however, shows that this scholarship is open to all majors.

In short, read the eligibility requirements for scholarships. No matter how specialized their title may be, you could still be in the running for that college cash.","Want to max out how much free cash you can get for college? Then keep reading, as we’ll offer up three simple tips that can ensure you get the most scholarships possible.

5266,"3 Signs You’re Searching For Scholarships The Wrong Way","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you’re doing the following, the answer is no, and you could be leaving thousands of dollars on the table that could keep you out of student loan debt.

The thought of going back to school to get your degree can be exciting, as it can open new doors for you while giving you a secure financial future. What’s not so exciting? Having to pay for your education, which could cost you several thousands of dollars at the very least.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

As you look for ways to pay for your education, offers for student loans may hit you from every angle. And while loans can help you go to school now without paying anything out of pocket, you will have to pay them back. In other words, taking out loans could put you into deep debt, which may lead to regrets down the line.

What’s a better option to pay for school? If you can get them, scholarships, as you won’t have to pay them back. Unfortunately, many students make mistakes when searching for scholarships that limit their opportunities. But if you keep reading, you won’t have to make those same mistakes to find the free funding you need.
<h4>Mistake #1 – Only looking for specific scholarships.</h4>
Is it a good idea to search for scholarships in your field? Of course, as it can help you filter out all of the available funding to find what you’re looking for quickly. This can backfire, however, if that’s the only way you search for scholarships.

For instance, let’s say you’re majoring in accounting. You begin your scholarship search by looking for “accounting scholarships” online. This helps you find several forms of aid rather quickly, but what about other opportunities?

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

If you continue, you could search for “business scholarships” and “finance scholarships.” By not limiting yourself, you’ll find a lot more opportunities. This is crucial since you’re not likely to win every single scholarship you apply for.
<h4>Mistake #2 – Quickly skimming scholarships.</h4>
It may seem like a pain, but you should invest as much time as possible into your scholarship search. Sure, it’s not fun reading over eligibility requirements, but think of the possible reward. For every scholarship you apply to, you could get thousands of dollars towards your education. Keeping this in mind, you should dive deep into the eligibility requirements for all scholarships you see, as you never know what you could find.

For example, we’ll assume you’re majoring in accounting once again. During your search, you stumble across the AES Engineering Scholarship. Since its title has nothing to do with accounting, business, or finance, you may move on to the next scholarship without knowing this: The AES Engineering Scholarship is open to all fields, so you could get it, even if you’re studying accounting.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Remember this example, as the names of some scholarships could be deceiving and could actually be right up your alley.
<h4>Mistake #3 – Not searching for scholarships throughout your college career.</h4>
They have scholarships for students at every step of their journeys. Just because you’re a sophomore in college, for example, doesn’t mean you should stop looking for additional financial aid. Until that degree is in your hand, keep searching for scholarships that can bolster your bottom line.","Is your scholarship search the best it can be?

5269,"New To Financial Aid? Read This First","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are some basics to get you up to speed before you sign up for any aid that could leave you in debt.

Getting a degree can help you work in your desired field, increase your income, and improve your family’s financial future. To get that degree, though, you’ll probably have a significant investment, as college can be quite expensive nowadays.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

How can you pay for college? You could work a full-time job and go to school at night or online, work a second job, or do side gigs to stack up some savings. You could also talk to people you know and ask for a loan, although that may be a long shot. Lastly, you could apply for various forms of financial aid, which is probably your best bet and the most common route used by many.

Searching for financial aid can be exciting, as you can see what type of funding is out there to make your college dreams a reality. Not all financial aid is created equal, though, as some of it can put you into debt that could turn into a nightmare later on.

To make your financial aid journey as problem-free as possible so you can find the funding you desire, have a look at these basics on the topic. They can give you a simple understanding of how financial aid works, so you can start searching for it today and get the ball rolling.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>1. Know what’s free and what isn’t.</h4>
When searching for financial aid, you’ll come across three main types of funding: Grants, scholarships, and loans. The first two are the most ideal, as you usually do not need to pay back grants or scholarships. A loan, on the other hand, must be paid back with interest.

Minimize the number of loans you take out, if possible. Search and apply for as many grants and scholarships as you can, as they’ll truly take a financial load off of your shoulders.
<h4>2. You can negotiate aid that doesn’t fit your needs.</h4>
Many people make the mistake of thinking financial aid offers are final. You can negotiate them in certain cases, so give the financial aid office a call so you can start an appeal, if necessary. Doing so could give you a better offer that fits your needs.

As a side note, you can also reject aid if you don’t need it. An offer doesn’t bind you to accept the aid.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. You may have some out of pocket expenses, even with aid.</h4>
Let’s say you get several grants and scholarships to help pay for school. You may even get a loan to cover some other costs as well. Does this mean you’ll have no out of pocket expenses? Not necessarily, as financial aid is there to help. It’s not a guarantee, however, that it will cover all of your costs.
<h4>4. Read all of the requirements that come with financial aid.</h4>
Getting financial aid offers are just part of the equation. Grants and scholarships, for example, may have requirements to keep that aid.

You may have to get good grades. You may be limited to using the funds for certain expenses or study purposes. And so on. Be fully aware of all the requirements, so you don’t end up losing any of your aid.","Financial aid can be beneficial to funding your college dreams, but it can also be confusing to navigate.

President Biden hasn’t been in office for long, but he’s already tackled the huge problem of food insecurity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Here is a quick recap of moves he’s made in his first few days when it comes to food assistance:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ol>
 	<li>Signed an order to increase food stamp funding to states by 15 percent.</li>
 	<li>Requested that the Thrifty Food Plan that determines food stamp eligibility be revamped so that more people can qualify for benefits.</li>
 	<li>Aims to extend the 15 percent increase in food stamp funding for as long as possible.</li>
 	<li>Increases Pandemic-EBT benefits by 15 percent, so kids from low-income homes can eat even though many schools are closed.</li>
 	<li>Hopes for $3 billion in additional funding for the WIC program that helps pregnant women and young children.</li>
 	<li>Asks for $1 billion in additional food assistance for U.S. territories.</li>
 	<li>Vows to include restaurants in the food supply chain so they can remain in business while also employing their workers and feeding their families.</li>
</ol>
Speaking of food assistance, here’s a list of several programs (with links) from the USDA that could offer the nutritional help your family needs:

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h4>
If you haven’t signed up for SNAP yet, now may be the time to do so. As mentioned, Biden is looking to make it easier to qualify for food stamps, while also upping the funding by 15 percent now and into the future.
<h4>Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</h4>
With Biden pledging an additional $3 billion in funding for this program, you could be able to buy baby formula and other nutritional necessities for your newborn or young children.
<h4>Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP)</h4>
As if COVID-19 wasn’t scary enough for seniors, some have found it hard to stay fed during these tough times. This program helps increase access to fruits, vegetables, and herbs grown locally, which can help boost immunity and strengthen a senior’s defenses.
<h4>Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)</h4>
Here’s another assistance program for seniors that offers free, nutritious foods.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)</h4>
As its name suggests, this program comes in handy when you’re in an emergency and have basically emptied your kitchen.
<h4>National School Lunch Program (NSLP)</h4>
It looks as if schools will start to open with President Biden in control. This program can give your children lunches that are extremely affordable or even free, so they’re never hungry in class.
<h4>School Breakfast Program (SBP)</h4>
Many kids skip out on breakfast due to a lack of money at home. The SBP can prevent this and give them the most important meal of the day at no cost.
<h4>Special Milk Program (SMP)</h4>
Your kids can use milk’s nutrients to grow strong bones, and the SMP can give them that nutritious drink for free.","If you have barely any money for food, President Biden has made several announcements that should be music to your ears.

5275,"How To Lower Your Rent By Relocating","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you feel like your rent is too expensive, you’re not alone. According to MSN Money, over 25 percent of renters spend at least half of their income on housing. With so much cash out the window for rent, it’s no wonder why so many go into deep debt and ruin their credit by not being able to pay other bills.

What’s the best move to make when you can no longer afford your rent? You could try to negotiate a lower rent with your landlord or increase your income, but sometimes, moving to a new place may be your best bet.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

When making your move, consider these factors, as they can help you make your rent more affordable, so you don’t run into a similar issue in the future:
<h4>1. Downgrade your living space.</h4>
You may need to move to a new property but still stay in the same area for work, your children’s school, and other purposes. If this is the case, try to rent a smaller property.

Beyond often offering cheaper rent, a smaller property can also provide other money-saving benefits. You could spend less on utilities, for instance. Or it could need less furniture, allowing you to sell some of your belongings for extra cash.
<h4>2. Move closer to work.</h4>
Speaking of needing to stay in the same area for work, moving closer to your place of employment could save you money on transportation costs. While it won’t lower your actual monthly rent payment, a shorter commute to work will keep more money in your pocket, which is your end goal anyway.

If your new home is close enough to your workplace, you may be able to ditch transportation costs altogether by walking or biking. Not only can this save you money, but it can save time as well if you’re used to a very long commute.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Move to a cheaper area.</h4>
Do you live in a big city that’s close to everything? You’ll pay a premium for that, which is why relocating to a cheaper, less populated area could save you serious cash on your rent.

Think of places where you’d like to live. Then go online to a real estate site and search for properties in those areas. You may find significant rent savings that make moving worth it.
<h4>4. Move in with family.</h4>
This may not be the ideal move to make, but it could be necessary if you just lost your job or have no savings. By moving in with family, you can use that time to save on rent and stack cash so you can move into another place later on.
<h4>5. Move in with other people.</h4>
Depending on your living situation, it may make sense to move into a place with roommates. By splitting the rent, you’ll pay less out of pocket. And while the sacrifice in privacy may not be ideal, you can use this time to save up for the future.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Become a house sitter.</h4>
House sitting has become popular since it helps people have someone look after their home while also providing lodging at no cost. If you’re the adventurous type who’s looking to save money, you can avoid rent altogether by using a site like TrustedHousesitters to find gigs.

In exchange for living in another person’s home for free, you may be asked to complete chores, provide security, or take care of pets, which isn’t too bad when considering the savings involved.","You may need to move if you can no longer afford where you’re living.

5296,"Is The Way You Drive Wasting Money?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What can you do to cut your transportation costs, especially since gas is going up? You could walk or ride a bike, but that’s probably inconvenient.

You could downgrade your car, but that’s a big hassle. You could also take public transportation, but being around other people in close quarters isn’t a great idea in times like these.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What cost-cutting options are left on the table? You could change the way you drive, which is easier than you think and can result in significant savings when it comes to gas consumption.

To change how you drive, you first have to see what mistakes you’re making. Here are some driving habits that waste gas, as well as recommendations on how you can fix them.
<h3>Driving Habits That Waste Gas</h3>
<h4>Accelerating Too Hard</h4>
Is it fun to floor it when you’re stopped at an intersection? Yes, but it’s also very wasteful, and it can make you use more gas than you should. Instead of flooring it and putting the pedal to the metal from a dead stop, accelerate gradually. This should cut down gas consumption since experts say 50 percent of your car’s energy is used to accelerate.
<h4>Speeding</h4>
The next time you speed past the posted limit, remember these statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy:
<ul>
 	<li>Driving 55 miles per hour versus 65 increases gas mileage by 15 percent.</li>
 	<li>For every five miles per hour you go past 50, it’s as if you’re paying 18 cents more per gallon of fuel.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h4>Constant Accelerating and Braking</h4>
Is your foot continually alternating between the gas pedal and brake? If so, that makes your fuel economy worse while also adding wear and tear to your brakes.

Learn to let your car glide instead of breaking and accelerating all the time. Anticipate red lights, stop signs, and turns, and let off the gas when they approach. This reduces gas-consuming acceleration and allows you to brake easier. By coasting/gliding, statistics show you can improve gas mileage by 40 percent.
<h4>Driving in Low Gear</h4>
Do you drive a stick shift? If so, you should make it a habit of getting into top gear as quickly as possible. If not, driving in low gear will waste gas.
<h4>Idling</h4>
Sitting in your parked car while it's running may seem harmless, but it’s incredibly wasteful when it comes to fuel. Studies show that just one hour of idling can waste half a gallon of gas, so keep your car turned off if you’re not driving it.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Driving on Underinflated Tires</h4>
Are your car’s tires inflated properly? They should be inflated according to your manufacturer’s recommendations. If not, you’ll get less than ideal fuel economy. And if they’re overinflated, you’ll wear out your tired treads prematurely and have to fork over cash for new ones.
<h4>Driving in a Packed Car</h4>
A car that’s weighed down will see its gas mileage suffer. Unless you need all of the stuff in it, clean out your car to make it lighter.","Are you making gas even more expensive by the way you drive? If the following driving habits seem familiar, then the answer is yes.","2021-02-22 20:12:01",post,https://mammothawards.com/is-the-way-you-drive-wasting-money/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_70407931.png,shutterstock_70407931.png,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_70407931.png,5297,shutterstock_70407931,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_70407931.png,"Financial Help",,publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,is-the-way-you-drive-wasting-money,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-27 21:52:39"
5308,"The 3 Primary Pieces Of A Section 8 Partnership","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you’re new to this government housing assistance program, we’ll provide some clarity by breaking down the three primary pieces of a Section 8 partnership.
<h3>The Section 8 Process</h3>
Section 8 may seem confusing if you’ve never really looked into it, but the process is rather straightforward when it comes to getting a housing voucher:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ol>
 	<li>You contact your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA). They help you learn more about Section 8, so you can begin your application.</li>
 	<li>Your application gets processed.</li>
 	<li>You’re either approved or rejected for a Housing Choice Voucher.</li>
 	<li>If approved, you get put on a waiting list to actually receive your voucher.</li>
 	<li>If rejected, you can appeal the decision.</li>
 	<li>Once your spot on the waiting list comes up, you can use your voucher to rent an apartment, townhome, or single-family home from a landlord.</li>
 	<li>The property you pick gets inspected to ensure it’s safe and meets Section 8 standards.</li>
 	<li>You move into the property.</li>
 	<li>You pay your portion of the rent to the landlord each month.</li>
 	<li>The rest of the rent gets paid directly to the landlord.</li>
</ol>
That’s the Section 8 process in a nutshell. And while your voucher journey may differ a bit, that’s basically what you can expect.

Why is it worth applying for Section 8 if you have to go through that process before you can move into your new place? Because with a voucher, you’ll only have to pay a certain amount of your monthly income (around 30 percent max) towards rent. In doing so, it becomes easier to avoid housing hassles, and you can finally start saving some money instead of wasting it all on rent.

To give you a better idea of who does what in a Section 8 partnership, let’s discuss the three primary roles.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

<h3>Section 8 Roles</h3>
<h4>Public Housing Agency</h4>
You could say it all starts at the top with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but the PHA administers the Section 8 program. What does the HUD do? They fund it.

The PHA is tasked with ensuring there’s no Section 8 fraud. It evaluates tenants to make sure they’re a good fit, and continues to do so to see that they’re eligible for the program.

Each month, your voucher goes from the PHA to the landlord, paying the Section 8 portion of the rent. The PHA also inspects properties every two years and offers customer service to both tenants and landlords to help the voucher process flow smoothly.
<h4>Landlord</h4>
Up next is the landlord, who is a private property owner that accepts Section 8 vouchers. Just as with a regular rental, the landlord manages the property, maintains it, collects rent and fees, and picks tenants.

The landlord must provide any utilities and services promised in the lease, all while not asking for side payments and extra fees, as they are not allowed.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Tenant</h4>
The final piece of the Section 8 puzzle is you, the tenant. You’ll have to obey the lease, pay your portion of the rent/utilities on time, and fix any damages you cause. You’ll also have to give 30-60 days notice if you’re going to terminate the lease or move.

While receiving a Section 8 voucher, you’ll need to provide any information requested by the PHA and HUD to ensure you remain eligible for the program. If not, you could lose your voucher.","How does Section 8 work? Who’s responsible for what? Keep reading to find out.","2021-03-05 08:18:59",post,https://mammothawards.com/the-3-primary-pieces-of-a-section-8-partnership/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1015072978.jpg,shutterstock_1015072978.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1015072978.jpg,5309,"Realtor,Agent,Giving,A,Key,Of,Apartment,To,New,Owner",,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1015072978.jpg,Housing,"Section 8",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,the-3-primary-pieces-of-a-section-8-partnership,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-05 08:18:59"
5311,"Do This, Or You Could Lose Your Section 8 Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Imagine drastically slashing how much you pay for rent while still getting to live in a place that’s safe, decent, and sanitary. That’s the whole goal of the government’s Section 8 program, and affordable rent combined with suitable housing is why it’s so popular.

Unfortunately, Section 8’s popularity comes with a price: Extremely long wait times. How long could you be waiting for a Section 8 voucher? Over a year, which is why you should apply now if you haven’t done so already by contacting your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA).

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since the demand for Section 8 vouchers is so high and the wait so long, holding onto yours is essential. What’s needed to keep your Section 8 voucher once you have it? Following certain rules that are expected of a Section 8 tenant. Here they are:
<h4>Section 8 Tenant Rules</h4>
Before we jump into this list, it’s worth noting that each PHA’s rules might vary slightly. Still, you can expect to become familiar with these during your housing voucher journey:
<h4>Finding Your Own Housing</h4>
There’s a misconception that Section 8 automatically equals living in some public housing projects. That couldn’t be further from the truth, as Section 8 puts you in control of where you live.

Are there some restrictions regarding the housing you can pick? Sure, but as long as the property fits these basic requirements, you should be good to go:
<ul>
 	<li>Located in the area approved by your PHA.</li>
 	<li>Apartment, townhome, or single-family home.</li>
 	<li>Charges reasonable rent.</li>
 	<li>Passes a Section 8 property inspection.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources-->

Once your voucher is approved, you will have a certain time limit to find housing. If time runs out, your voucher could be given to someone else.
<h4>Paying Fees Out of Your Own Pocket</h4>
Yes, your Section 8 voucher will help pay some of your rent each month, but it won’t help with these two common costs:
<ul>
 	<li>Application fees from landlords.</li>
 	<li>Security deposits.</li>
</ul>
You’ll have to pay for those yourself, so save up as much as you can to avoid any snags due to a lack of cash.
<h4>Following Your Landlord’s Rules</h4>
In a standard rental agreement, your landlord outlines rules you must follow as a tenant. The same will be expected of you with Section 8. If you get evicted for not following the rules, you can lose your voucher.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Paying the Rent on Time</h4>
You’ll have to pay some of the rent (around 30 percent of your income), even if you get approved for Section 8 assistance. The rent must be paid on time to keep your voucher.
<h4>Living On-Site</h4>
To receive Section 8 assistance, you will have to live on the property. You cannot lease it to someone else, as that is considered fraud.
<h4>Keeping in Touch With Your PHA and Landlord</h4>
If your household gains or loses income or family members, you’ll have to notify your PHA, as that can affect your voucher amount. And if you decide to move, you’ll have to give proper notice to your landlord and PHA.","A Section 8 voucher could be the key to fixing your finances.

5324,"How To Get Affordable Internet During The Pandemic","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Life as we know it has changed in so many ways since COVID-19 appeared. Depending on where you live, your kids may need to take online classes at home until classrooms open up again. And if you worked in an office, you may be working from home now.

What’s one thing that’s become a necessity in response to these significant life changes? The Internet, because without it, your kids can’t attend their virtual classes, and you can’t get your work done. But even though Internet may be a necessity, that doesn’t mean you can fit it in your already tight budget.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Luckily, there are ways to get the Internet service you need without paying a ton of money. We’ll discuss them now so you can get connected soon.
<h4>Verizon Lifeline Discount Program</h4>
We’ll start with the priciest of the bunch. Verizon’s Lifeline Discount Program offers Internet at a $20 discount off its regular price. This leads to a monthly payment of $19.99 plus equipment charges and taxes.

If that seems like it’s too much, keep in mind what you’re getting: 200Mbps speeds via fiber-optic technology. Why is this important? Because you may want faster speeds for other purposes beyond schoolwork and office tasks, such as streaming video or gaming.
<h4>Comcast Internet Essentials</h4>
For about half the price of Verizon’s service, you can get Internet from Comcast. The Internet Essentials program costs just $9.95 per month plus tax. With it, you don’t have to worry about a credit check or even a contract. Even better, you can get two free months of service due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Qualifying for Internet Essentials is as easy as being eligible for other forms of assistance, such as the National School Lunch Program, SNAP, SSI, or Medicaid.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>Access from AT&amp;T</h4>
The highlights of AT&amp;T’s Access program include free installation, no deposit, and no contract. For under $10 per month, you can get reliable speeds of up to 25Mbps, which should suffice for your children’s studies and your needs.

It’s worth noting that AT&amp;T has waived data overage fees in response to COVID-19, which is excellent news if you expect to be online a lot.
<h4>Mediacom Connect 2 Compete</h4>
This low-income Internet service caters especially to households with young students. If your child qualifies for the National School Lunch Program, you can get Mediacom’s Internet for $9.95 per month plus tax. No deposit or contract is required, and you won’t have to pay any installation or equipment rental fees either.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Your Current Internet Provider</h4>
You may have Internet service already. But since the pandemic has led to so much economic loss, you may have trouble paying your bill every month.

If this is the case, give your Internet provider a call. Let them know that you’re looking for ways to cut costs, and ask if they have any suggestions. They may have procedures in place for the pandemic that could lower your monthly bill. If not, they may be able to get you on a manageable payment plan or suggest something else so you can keep your Internet without feeling financially strained.","Here are places offering Internet service at incredibly affordable rates, so you can keep more money in your pocket during the pandemic.","2021-04-05 18:48:31",post,https://mammothawards.com/how-to-get-affordable-internet-during-the-pandemic/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1325579510.jpg,shutterstock_1325579510.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1325579510.jpg,5325,shutterstock_1325579510,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1325579510.jpg,Uncategorized,"Covid Relief",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,how-to-get-affordable-internet-during-the-pandemic,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:58:07"
5327,"Confused About COVID-19 Stimulus Checks? Read This","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Reaction to the Economic Impact Payments (aka coronavirus stimulus checks) has been mixed. Some people were relieved to hear that even a little bit of financial help was on the way. Others wished that the checks were bigger. And whether you’re okay with the payments or want more money, this is something that seems to be quite common: Confusion about it all.

How much will your checks be? When and how will you get them? What are the eligibility requirements? What do you need to do to get them? All of these questions are probably floating around in your mind as you try to stay afloat during the pandemic. We’ll do our best to answer them.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>When Were the Economic Impact Payments Announced?</h4>
We are now up to two sets of Economic Impact Payments. The first was authorized back in March of last year. The second was confirmed in December of last year, and it’s the one you have to keep your eye on, as many people still haven’t received that second payment yet.
<h4>What Must You Do to Get a Stimulus Payment?</h4>
There’s no application process for the COVID-19 stimulus payments, as it’s tied to your tax returns. As long as you filed your return and meet eligibility requirements which we’ll reveal in a minute, you should be good to go. If you haven’t filed your 2020 tax return, do so now with help from MyFreeTaxes at no cost.
<h4>What Are the Eligibility Requirements?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>You can’t be listed as a dependent on another person’s taxes.</li>
 	<li>Your Social Security number must be valid.</li>
 	<li>You must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien.</li>
 	<li>You must meet the income requirements.</li>
</ul>
As far as income is concerned, your adjusted gross income cannot exceed the following:
<ul>
 	<li>$75,000 for individuals</li>
 	<li>$112,500 for heads of households</li>
 	<li>$150,000 for married couples filing jointly</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

You can make more income than what’s listed. It will reduce your stimulus payment, though:
<ul>
 	<li>Individuals – up to $99,000</li>
 	<li>Heads of households – up to $136,500</li>
 	<li>Couples – up to $198,000</li>
</ul>
<h4>What Are the Stimulus Payouts?</h4>
The first stimulus had the following payouts:
<ul>
 	<li>$1,200 per eligible adult</li>
 	<li>$500 per dependent child</li>
</ul>
The second stimulus dropped overall to these amounts:
<ul>
 	<li>$600 per eligible adult</li>
 	<li>$600 per dependent child</li>
</ul>
So, if you have a family of five with two adults and three dependent children, your first payout would equal:

$1,200 + $1,200 + $500 + $500+ $500 = $3,900

And your second payout would equal:

$600 + $600 + $600 + $600 + $600 = $3,000

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>What Are the Methods of Payment?</h4>

Before you go hungry, have a look at this long list of coronavirus food assistance options that could save the day.

Many families are struggling to stay fed during the coronavirus pandemic. If you’re one of them, you’ll be happy to know that there are several options for food assistance that could hold you over until you get your finances in order.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here’s a list of food assistance solutions that are both short and long-term. Try as many as possible so that nutrition is no longer one of your worries.
<h4>211</h4>
Give 211 a call if your food situation is so bad that you’re near the point of starvation. A quick conversation with a local operator can give you all the info you need to find food today and keep deprivation at bay.

Since 211 offers all types of assistance, don’t forget to ask for help with other issues you’re having, such as housing, paying bills, healthcare, etc.
<h4>National Hunger Hotline</h4>
Similar to 211, this is a number you can call to find food assistance quickly. The hotline is open on Monday through Friday between 7 am and 10 pm. For help in English, call 866-3-HUNGRY. Spanish speakers should call 877-8-HAMBRE.

<h4>State Agencies</h4>
Every state has its own agency that handles food assistance programs. Give yours a call to see what’s available in your state. To find your agency, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">click here</a>.
<h4>FoodFinder</h4>
<a href=""https://foodfinder.us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">This easy-to-use online tool</a> can help you find food pantries in your area. All it takes is entering your zip code to find emergency food assistance within seconds.
<h4>Find Meals for Kids Tool</h4>
Here’s another handy online tool. Unlike FoodFinder, however, Find Meals for Kids is a tool that specializes in pinpointing nutrition assistance for children.

<h4>Food Stamps</h4>
The suggestions listed above can all help you find quick food assistance. What about long-term nutritional help, though? You may need it to avoid emergencies in the future, which is why applying for food stamps (aka SNAP) is a smart move.

With food stamps, you get funds to buy grocery store essentials that can fill your fridge and cupboard. Right now is the best time to apply, too, since many requirements for food stamps have been relaxed. Even better, the benefits have increased in response to the pandemic.
<h4>WIC</h4>
It’s a must that pregnant women and young children have their nutritional needs met. If you’re pregnant or have young kids, WIC can supply you with formula, baby food, and healthy items at no cost.","Has the pandemic depleted your bank account to the point that you can no longer afford food?

5338,"12 Things You Should Know About Homeless Hotel Vouchers","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may be surprised that something like a hotel or motel voucher exists, especially if you’re homeless and feel that your only housing options are staying with friends and family or at a shelter. However, these vouchers do exist, and here are some things you should know about them before pursuing one.
 
1. Hotel vouchers are a short-term solution for homelessness. You can typically count on using a voucher to stay in a hotel or motel for about three nights maximum.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
 
2. Motel vouchers are limited. Getting a hotel or motel room for free via a voucher is quite rare. For this reason, you should know that finding a hotel voucher may not be easy.
 
3. The primary purpose of a hotel voucher is to offer temporary housing for recently homeless people. Again, they are not long-term solutions.
 
4. Hotel vouchers are more common than motel vouchers. This is mainly because hotels are more expensive, and such assistance is costly enough as it is.
 
5. Places where you can look for hotel vouchers include Catholic Charities, the Salvation Army, the United Way, your local homeless shelter, or your local government.
 
6. Vouchers are sometimes given for use at a public housing unit or a local shelter. While not as ideal as a hotel or motel, these offers are still advantageous for someone looking to fix their housing situation after an eviction or disaster.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->
 
7. Some hotel voucher programs are seasonal and tend to pick up in the winter months when it’s freezing outside, and homeless shelters are at capacity. Large cities experiencing summer heat waves may also enact motel voucher programs so homeless people who are sick can stay out of extreme temperatures.
 
8. Motel voucher programs may focus on specific groups, depending on the location. For instance, some voucher programs may be limited to seniors. Others may focus on offering vouchers to single parents, those who are disabled, or even single men.
 
9. In some cases, your hotel voucher may also include transportation to your lodging.
 
10. Hotel and motel vouchers can be expensive to provide, which is why nonprofit agencies often hold fundraisers so they can offer them to the homeless.
 
11. Many motel vouchers come with rules and restrictions you’ll need to follow to keep that benefit. You may need to check in with the agency that gave you the voucher. A meeting with the agency may be necessary, so you can go over a plan to end your homelessness. You may also need to show proof that you are seeking employment or are working. Since hotel vouchers are very temporary, the goal of the agencies that provide them is to ensure you get out of the homeless cycle as quickly as possible.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->
 
12. Special situations where homeless hotel vouchers may be offered include to help those who suffered a disaster like a hurricane, flood, or fire. If you are fleeing an abusive environment or are a domestic violence victim, that may also give you access to a motel voucher.

5345,"3 Tips To Get The Best Deal On A Used Car","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Having reliable transportation is a must if you need to go to work, get your kids to school, or run errands. Contrary to popular belief, a car doesn’t have to be new to provide reliable transportation. There are many used cars on the market with low miles, warranties, and in excellent condition that can fill your transportation needs. They may present pitfalls, however, which the following tips should help you avoid.
<h4>1. Shop when used car deals are hot.</h4>
You can’t always plan when you need to buy a used car. Your old one may have broken down, triggering the need for an immediate replacement. But if you can be a bit strategic when making your purchase, these are the best times to snag a great used car deal:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Holidays like the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Memorial Day when dealerships hold massive sales events.</li>
 	<li>The end of months and quarters when dealerships’ sales teams need to meet their goals.</li>
 	<li>At the end of model years (near September and October) when dealerships need to clear out used stock to make space for new arrivals.</li>
 	<li>On weekdays when car lots are less crowded, and you can get more assistance from salespeople.</li>
</ul>
If you can wait to make your used car purchase, mark your calendar with those dates listed above.
<h4>2. Know the car’s value.</h4>
Unless you’re a car expert or work for a dealership, you probably don’t know what each car is worth. Luckily, you don’t have to, as several online services can handle that task for you.

You can gain some negotiating power by knowing a car’s value through sites like Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, and Carfax. At the very least, you’ll know whether you’re overpaying for a car so you can avoid getting ripped off.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Shop trusted sources.</h4>
You have plenty of options when it comes to buying a used car. You can visit local lots and do it the old fashioned way. You can go online to see what’s available and in your price range. You can also buy from private sellers.

What’s the best way to buy a used car? That depends on several factors. But if you’re looking for peace of mind, you may want to visit a large franchised dealership. Their vehicles may be in better condition. Buy one that’s certified pre-owned, and you can even get a warranty so you don’t have to worry about repairs that can come with a car’s age.

If you’re worried about lemons, steer clear of smaller independent lots. Even though they may offer lower prices, your risk of getting a not-so-great deal is higher. And if you finance through them, you could be looking at high interest rates.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Taking the private seller route can land you a lower-priced vehicle. If this is your preferred option, don’t forget to do the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Get a Carfax report.</li>
 	<li>Ask about the car’s history and maintenance.</li>
 	<li>Make sure the title is clear.</li>
 	<li>Have your mechanic inspect the vehicle.</li>
</ul>","Are you in the market for a used car?

You may have had it tough lately during the coronavirus pandemic. But no matter how hard these times have been on you, there’s probably someone else you worry about even more: Your child.

You want to make sure they get fed every day, so their nutrition doesn’t falter to avoid health issues. And you want them to have the chance to get an education to have a prosperous future.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

As fundamental as those desires may be, they can be tough to fulfill if your income is limited and you haven’t had the opportunities to advance. With the American Families Plan, though, your income may not matter, especially when it comes to providing top-notch nutrition and education for your child.

While it hasn’t been officially approved as of yet, there’s hope that the American Families Plan will go live. And if it does, here’s how it could positively impact your child’s nutrition and education.
<h4>Nutrition Benefits</h4>
Are you familiar with the Summer Pandemic-EBT program? It was created in response to the coronavirus. Since schools had to close for safety reasons, many parents wondered how they would replace free or reduced-price meals that their kids enjoyed when classes were in session. With Summer Pandemic-EBT, they received funds to buy food to replace those meals.

The American Families Plan aims to make Summer Pandemic-EBT permanent, so you’ll never have to worry about your child’s nutrition during the summer.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

Not all schools have access to free meals for their students. To increase accessibility, President Biden wants to ease eligibility requirements for free meals at high-poverty schools. If successful, this would put food in the mouths of 9.3 million more children.

While having free school meals is excellent, you want them to be nutritious. The chances of that happening will improve since the American Families Plan will incentivize schools to exceed nutritional standards with their meals.
<h4>Education Benefits</h4>
You don’t want your child to get a late start on their education. With the American Families Plan, children as young as three and four would be able to enjoy free preschool. It’s estimated that five million children would benefit from free pre-school, and their parents would save an average of $13,000 in child care costs.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Child care doesn’t end when a child passes four years of age, though. That’s why the American Families Plan wants to make child care more affordable. The most vulnerable families would enjoy free child care, while others would only have to pay a certain percentage of income for those services.

What about college? Biden’s plan would make community college free. This is excellent news for anyone looking to earn a degree or certification to solidify their financial future. But since four-year colleges can be costly, the American Families Plan also wants to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $1,400.","The world can be a scary place nowadays.

The next time you hear the American Families Plan mentioned on the news, you may want to pay closer attention. Why? Because President Biden’s newest plan is loaded with benefits for families. And if it gets approved and signed into law, this plan could positively impact you and your family’s well-being in more ways than one.

Here are some reasons why you should be rooting for this ambitious plan’s approval:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. You could take leave from work without worry.</h4>
Imagine having to worry about work and income when one of the following happens:
<ul>
 	<li>You have a baby.</li>
 	<li>A loved one passes.</li>
 	<li>Your military family member has to deploy overseas.</li>
 	<li>You get sick.</li>
 	<li>You have to take care of a loved one who’s sick.</li>
</ul>
With the American Families Plan, you wouldn’t have to worry about taking off work for one of those reasons. The plan would create a national leave program for family and medical reasons, and it would offer twelve weeks of benefits up to $4,0000 per month.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Health care would be cheaper.</h4>
Do you ever worry that you or a loved one could get sick and you have no way to pay for medical care? The American Families Plan would make health insurance more affordable so you could make that worry disappear. If approved, health insurance rebates from the American Families Plans could help you save $50 monthly per family member.
<h4>3. Your tax situation would improve.</h4>
A Child Tax Credit of $3,600 for kids under six and $3,000 for kids over six. Getting up to half of your child care expenses refunded as a tax credit. Plus, a permanent Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers. All are included in the American Families Plan and would help many struggling families push past poverty.
<h4>4. Child care would be cheaper.</h4>
Kids ages three and four would get free, high-quality pre-school. Families struggling the most financially could get free child care. And those not eligible for free child care would only pay a small percentage of their income towards such services. If you have young children, these are all reasons to hope that the American Families Plan becomes official.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Your children’s nutrition wouldn’t falter.</h4>
When schools shut due to COVID-19, did you panic? You may have if your children received free or reduced-price meals. But once the Summer Pandemic-EBT hit, you probably felt relief, as the program gave you money for food while schools were closed.

Under the American Families Plan, this pandemic-linked program would become permanent, so your kids’ summer nutrition would no longer be an issue.
<h4>6. You or your kids could go to college at no cost.</h4>
Do you have teens getting ready to graduate high school? Would you like to get your degree or certification to increase your earning potential? Regardless of who’s attending, community college would be free with the American Families Plan.","If you think the American Families Plan can’t affect you, think again.

Are you concerned about losing housing stability due to the COVID-19 pandemic? If so, you’re certainly not alone, as many have had trouble paying their landlords due to job and income loss.

While not being able to pay your rent right now is bad news, here’s a bit of good news: You may be protected against eviction, at least into the near future, thanks to the CDC Eviction Moratorium.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Eviction Protection From the CDC</h3>
Even though it’s been a year since the coronavirus appeared, the risk remains. You can still spread the virus by being in close quarters with others, which is why the CDC Eviction Moratorium.

The science behind the moratorium is simple: By preventing evictions, the risk of spreading the coronavirus is reduced. Why? Because families won’t be forced to live in homeless shelters or crowded housing with friends and family. Instead, they can stay where they are, remain safe, and maintain housing stability as a bonus.

Under the CDC Eviction Moratorium, those who qualify cannot be evicted for not paying the rent. This does not mean that rent payments are waived, though. Once the moratorium expires, any back rent will be due, as well as fees and interest. In short, qualifying for eviction protection from the CDC does not equal free rent. And beyond that, you can still be evicted if you do not abide by other terms listed in your lease.
<h3>How to Qualify For the CDC Eviction Moratorium</h3>
Anyone interested in COVID-19 eviction protection must apply using <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this form</a>. Once complete, the form must be submitted to the person who has the power to evict you.

You will first have to qualify based on your income level. Then you will have to declare that you’ve tried to pay the rent and will pay what’s due once the moratorium is over.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

To see if you qualify based on income, ask yourself these questions:

Set 1:

1. Were you exempt from reporting income to the IRS last year?
2. Do you receive government assistance, such as SSI, SSDI, TANF, or SNAP?
3. Was your individual income below $99,000 in 2020/2021? Was your joint income below $198,000?
4. Did you receive a stimulus check?

Set 2:

These questions pertain to why you cannot pay the rent right now.

1. Did your income decrease?
2. Did your hours or wages decrease?
3. Did you lose your job?
4. Do you have a large number of medical expenses that you’re paying out of pocket?

To qualify, you need to answer yes to at least one question from each set. A side note worth mentioning is that all buildings are covered by the CDC Eviction Moratorium, such as:

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<ul>
 	<li>Apartments</li>
 	<li>Single-family homes</li>
 	<li>Mobile homes</li>
 	<li>Land leased for residential purposes</li>

Here’s a quick background on the program and how to apply for its money-saving benefits.

As you try to <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/4-sites-that-help-you-find-the-best-online-deals/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">hold on to every dollar you have</a>, you’ll have to get picky about how you spend your money. Unfortunately, there are some places where you can’t be picky, such as housing, food, and utilities.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

All are necessities that cannot be avoided, but when it comes to utilities like electricity, the good news is that some help may be on the way.

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, has been around for decades. The government instituted it to help low-income households pay for heating and cooling costs. It’s essential to keep this in mind, as qualifying for LIHEAP does not mean that your entire electricity bill will be taken care of.

Still, such assistance could make a significant difference in your monthly budget, especially in months where temperatures are particularly hot and cold. During these times, when your AC or furnace always runs, those energy bills can skyrocket. With LIHEAP paying for a portion of those bills, you can keep more money in your pocket.

While LIHEAP’s bill-paying assistance aspect is nice, its “weatherization” features may be even better, as they could cut your future heating and cooling costs via improvements to your home. If your local LIHEAP office offers weatherization, you could make your home more energy-efficient via added insulation, proper sealing, or repairs to an inefficient AC or furnace.

Now that you know how LIHEAP can help, let’s look at what you can do to receive these benefits.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h3>How to Get Energy Bill Assistance Through LIHEAP</h3>
Follow these steps to apply for LIHEAP:
<h4>1. Do a quick prescreen of yourself.</h4>
LIHEAP benefits are awarded according to need. Each local office has its own requirements, but here is what you can expect to qualify for the program:

Income – You may need to make less than 150% of the poverty level to qualify. There may be a state-specific requirement, as well.
Government assistance – Simply receiving benefits from other government programs could lead to automatic eligibility with LIHEAP.

Regarding government assistance, receiving benefits from any of the following could make you eligible for LIHEAP:
<ul>
 	<li>Veteran’s benefits</li>
 	<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li>
 	<li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</li>
 	<li>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</li>
</ul>
Also, if you reside in public/subsidized housing and are a renter, you could qualify for the program’s energy bill assistance.

Use this prescreen to get an idea of whether or not you’d be a candidate for the program. Don’t let it disqualify you, though, as the next step should be taken regardless.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>2. Get in touch with your local office.</h4>
Your nearest LIHEAP office will guide you through the application process. You can locate yours by clicking here.

5366,"How To Find The Best Laptop For Your Budget","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Buying a reliable laptop that’s also affordable is easier than ever. You can thank the Internet for that, as you can now <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/6-free-chrome-extensions-that-make-it-easy-to-find-bargains-online/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">comparison shop</a>, read reviews, and more from the comfort of your couch.

What if you’ve never bought a laptop before, though? What should you do to ensure you not only get what you need but also buy it without going broke in the process? The quick answer is to follow these tips, as they’ll lead you down the right path to purchasing the perfect laptop.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>Before You Buy</h4>
If you did a random search for laptops, you’d probably get overwhelmed by the variation in:
<ul>
 	<li>Price</li>
 	<li>Brands</li>
 	<li>Models</li>
 	<li>Hardware</li>
 	<li>Display size</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
For this reason, you have to narrow down what you’re looking for, which can be accomplished by:
<ul>
 	<li>Determining your budget – How much are you willing to spend while still being able to afford it?</li>
 	<li>Determining the laptop’s usage – What will you use it for? Work? School? Entertainment? Gaming? Basic Web browsing?</li>
 	<li>Picking out the best brands/models – Which brand has a solid reputation for quality and service? Which models have all of the specifications you’re looking for while being in your price range?</li>
</ul>
[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

With those three things figured out, your laptop search becomes more definite. Now you can really go online to find out more about your potential purchase.
<h4>While Searching</h4>
There’s no shortage of places either online or in person to find that perfect laptop. To play it safe, however, you may want to go with some of the more prominent names in the electronics industry to have some much-needed peace of mind throughout the process.

In-person retailers that are pretty popular for laptops and other electronics include places like Best Buy and Walmart. The benefit of using these options is that you can test the laptops to see how they look and feel, which cannot be done when shopping on the Internet.

Online, you may want to take a closer look at NewEgg, Amazon, or TigerDirect. All make it incredibly easy to pinpoint the type of laptop you want that fits your spec needs, price range, and more.

Best of all, shopping for a laptop online allows you to see reviews from previous buyers. They can let you know the pros and cons of each computer, so you know of potential issues before spending your hard-earned cash.

If you find that you’re not too impressed with any options at your pre-determined price point, you may want to consider buying refurbished. Laptops with this label can still function as desired, as they are put through tests to ensure they’re in tip-top shape. You can also get a warranty, so it can be like buying brand new, but at a lower cost.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

If you still aren’t finding great deals in your search, consider the time. If you’re close to any of the following periods that are loaded with great discounts, you may want to wait a bit to make your purchase:
<ul>
 	<li>June-September – Back to school sales</li>
 	<li>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</li>
 	<li>Near events for product launches – September for Apple, October for Microsoft</li>
</ul>","There’s no need to break the bank or get stuck with something you don’t like when buying a laptop.

5369,"Here Are Housing Choice Vouchers In A Nutshell","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>What are Housing Choice Vouchers?</h4>
In basic terms, you can think of a Housing Choice Voucher as a coupon for your rent. Just like you’d use a coupon in the grocery store to pay less for an item, you can use a voucher to <a href=""https://mammothawards.com/how-to-lower-your-rent-by-relocating/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pay less for your housing each month</a>.

Unlike a grocery coupon, however, you won’t be in possession of the voucher. Your local public housing agency (PHA) will control it, and each month they’ll pay that discounted portion of the rent directly to your landlord. Once the voucher is sent, and your landlord is partially paid by the PHA, you will have to pay whatever is leftover.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Who Gets Vouchers?</h4>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created the voucher program primarily to help people who make a low income, are elderly, or disabled. To officially qualify, things like your income, how many people live in your household, citizenship, etc. will be considered.
<h4>Where Can Vouchers Be Used?</h4>
While many think that Section 8 vouchers limit you to living in a subsidized housing project, that’s really not the case. In fact, you can have a decent range of housing choices, depending on where you’re looking to live. For instance, you could live in a traditional apartment using your housing voucher or enjoy cheap rent in a single-family home.

Can you pick whatever property you desire? No, as it will have to meet the program’s standards. The landlord will also have to be a Section 8 participant.

If you don’t want to move, but are having trouble paying rent where you currently live, there is a possibility that you can get a voucher while staying put. Again, as long as the housing is up to standard and your landlord agrees, Section 8 may be an option that keeps you stationary.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>Is the Voucher Process Quick?</h4>
As you can imagine, the demand for housing assistance from Section 8 is quite high. Certain areas with particularly high demand can have waiting lists that last years. Thus, applying to live in some locations may be a smarter move than choosing areas with extremely high demand.

After you apply for a housing voucher, you will have to wait for approval. If you qualify, you will be moved to a waiting list. Once your turn arrives, you can finally get the housing voucher to move into the home you chose.
<h4>How Do You Get a Voucher?</h4>
The HUD funds the entire Section 8 program. To apply, however, you will be working directly with your PHA. For this reason, it’s best to get acquainted with your PHA by contacting them now.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Your PHA will have information on how the program works, the income limits for the area where you want to live, and more. The sooner you contact them, the better, so you can get an ideal spot on the waiting list.","Do you want to learn a lot about Housing Choice Vouchers in a little time? Then keep reading, as we’ll give you the lowdown on how this previously named Section 8 program works.","2021-09-01 00:54:56",post,https://mammothawards.com/here-are-housing-choice-vouchers-in-a-nutshell/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_470165267.png,shutterstock_470165267.png,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_470165267.png,5370,shutterstock_470165267,,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_470165267.png,Housing,"Savings And Loans",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,here-are-housing-choice-vouchers-in-a-nutshell,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:01:36"
5386,"4 Federal Student Grant Programs At A Glance","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

So, you just got accepted to a local college, big-time university, or a career school. While the excitement of that accomplishment is great, it may be overshadowed by worry about something pretty significant: The cost of that schooling. After all, continuing education isn’t cheap, and unless you have hefty savings or help from family, you’ll need help with paying tuition and other expenses.

Can student loans swoop in to save the day? Sure, but they aren’t exactly gifts since you’ll have to pay them back. And this alone may make you dread paying for college.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s a better option? One that you do not have to worry about paying back, which is precisely what a federal student grant can provide.

While the number of college grants you’ll find is vast, here are four federal student grant programs worth focusing on, at least at the beginning of your search. Please remember that the award amounts can change every year:
<h4>1. Pell Grant</h4>
If you had to make a list of the top college grants, <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the Pell Grant</a> would probably sit at the top. It’s quite popular among students, and if you qualify for it in the current year, you can receive up to $6,345 in funding for school.

Qualifying for a Pell Grant is relatively simple. First, you must have a financial need that shows you’ll need help paying for your education. Second, you cannot have a degree, as this grant is mostly reserved for undergraduate students. If you are doing a teacher certification program, you may still qualify, but that’s pretty much the only exception.

Pell Grants last for 12 semesters. Once you use all 12 up or you graduate, your Pell Grant eligibility will end.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</h4>
<a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/fseog"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The FSEOG</a> can combine with your Pell Grant money to give your bank account a significant boost while completing your studies. If eligible for a Pell Grant – which you’ll know by <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">completing your FAFSA form</a> – you will receive priority for this grant that can give you up to $4,000 per year.

It’s worth noting that all schools do not participate in the FSEOG, and its funds may be limited, which is why you should complete your FAFSA form as soon as possible to get in line for these and other federal student benefits.
<h4>3. Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant (TEACH)</h4>
As you can tell by its name, this federal student grant is focused on those looking to work in the teaching field. Unlike the first two grants in the list, <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/teach"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TEACH is available to those who have already earned their degree</a> and are looking to further their education.

You can receive up to $3,764 through TEACH. Once again, that amount may change.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant</h4>
<a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/iraq-afghanistan-service"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">This grant</a> was initiated to help students who lost a parent or guardian through military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after 9/11. Should you qualify, you could receive up to $5,829.50.","You could get free money from the federal government to make your dream of going to college come true.

5390,"How To Get A Free Laptop","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Think of everything you could do with a laptop. Your child could use it to attend virtual classes, especially in a situation like we’ve had with the pandemic. You could use it to get your online degree. What about shopping? You could find the best deals online via your laptop, which would make shopping more convenient and cost-effective. And everyone in your household could use that laptop for entertainment and to stay connected with friends and family.

Now think about that laptop’s cost. Even if it’s not some high-end MacBook, the laptop will still cost you at least a few hundred dollars. And while that may not seem like a lot to some, it is if you’re barely making ends meet.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

Does a laptop’s cost mean you should go without one? Not necessarily, as there are now ways to get a laptop at no cost, provided you know where to look, and you qualify. Let’s look at those ways now.
<h4>Get a Free Laptop Through School</h4>
Perhaps the easiest way to get a free laptop is through a school. This can apply to your child’s school, as many kids received free laptops over the past year due to the pandemic. But since schools are opening their doors once again, you may be wondering if this is still an option.

Certain schools will allow parents to teach their children from home. If this is an option for your child, the school may offer a free laptop to aid in their studies. You will have to contact schools in your area to see if such a setup is available.

Besides your child’s school, you may also get a free laptop if you decide to pick the right online college to get your degree. The online college landscape is highly competitive nowadays, so many offer complimentary laptops with enrollment to attract students.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

Should you let a free laptop dictate where you go to college? Of course not. But it is good to know that this option is out there.

To see which online colleges offer free laptops for their students, <a href=""https://oedb.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">go here</a>.
<h4>Get a Free Laptop From a Non-Profit Organization</h4>
Some people donate their laptops when they upgrade to something new. Where do those laptops end up? Often, in the hands of non-profit organizations that give the laptops to those who need them most.

That last sentence is significant, as you will probably need to apply for a free laptop from a non-profit to show that you don’t surpass a certain income.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Here is a list of some non-profits that offer free laptops:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.computerswithcauses.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Computers With Causes</a> – Offers free laptops to military members and vets, low-income households, and underprivileged kids.</li>

5395,"Do You Qualify For A Free Phone From The Lifeline Program?","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You could even get a free phone from it. To see if you qualify for these money-saving benefits, keep reading.

Times are tough right now, and keeping your expenses low is a must if you hope to avoid financial issues. What’s one expense that can take a considerable chunk out of your monthly budget? Your telephone, which could be quite costly if you have both a landline and a cell phone.

How can you reduce your phone expense? Getting rid of your landline is a popular option. So is changing your cell phone provider or downgrading your plan to something with fewer bells and whistles. But another option that may be even better is to see if you <a href=""https://www.lifelinesupport.org/how-to-get-lifeline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">qualify for the Lifeline program</a>.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Is Lifeline?</h4>
Started by the FCC, this program helps low-income families and individuals enjoy affordable landline or cell phone service, and even a free phone in some cases. The program also offers discounted Internet service.
<h4>Lifeline Eligibility</h4>
To qualify for Lifeline, your income will need to be 135 percent or less of the federal poverty guidelines. You can also be eligible if you or someone in your household participates in a government program, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Section 8</li>
 	<li>Medicaid</li>
 	<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li>
 	<li>Head Start</li>
 	<li>SNAP (food stamps)</li>
</ul>
Receiving a federal veteran's pension or participating in tribal programs can also help you qualify.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>Applying for Lifeline</h4>
The first step in applying for the Lifeline program involves finding a participating company in your area. You can do this by <a href=""https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">clicking here</a> and entering your zip code or city and state in the fields near the bottom of the page.

Once you find a participating company, call them and ask for a Lifeline application. You will need several pieces of info handy to apply, such as your:
<ul>
 	<li>Full name</li>
 	<li>Date of birth</li>
 	<li>Last four digits of your Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Address</li>
</ul>
To prove your identity, you will need one of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Social Security card</li>
 	<li>Last year’s tax return</li>
 	<li>ID (cannot be expired)</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

Lastly, you will need to prove that you’re eligible for the program, which can be done via a tax return or three consecutive pay stubs if you’re using income to qualify. If not, you’ll need an award letter or card showing that you participate in one of the government programs listed above.

It’s worth noting that you’re limited to one Lifeline discount per household. This means that you can get either a phone or Internet discount, but not both. Discounts are not awarded on a per-person basis.

As for how much the Lifeline discount is worth, the answer is not much. If you qualify, you can expect to receive up to $9.25 towards your phone or Internet bill. While that obviously won’t fix all of your financial issues, every bit helps, so if you think you’re eligible for the Lifeline discount, <a href=""https://www.lifelinesupport.org/how-to-get-lifeline/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">apply today</a>.","Lifeline is a program from the FCC that can help pay for a portion of your landline or cell phone service.

If you’re like 12 million Americans, you’ve probably turned to a payday loan in the past to get quick financial assistance. And even though that payday loan may have filled your pockets temporarily, its high interest rate likely put you in a pinch later on.

Unfortunately, payday loans have been viewed as the only option for many who need fast financing. Even though they can put you in debt with ridiculous interest charges, the fact that such loans can pay bills or put food on the table has made them famous. Does this mean you should turn to a payday loan the next time you need cash quickly? No, as we’re about to discuss a different type of loan that can help while offering additional benefits.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Installment Loans</h4>
We mentioned that payday loans typically come with outrageous interest rates. But just how bad can they be? Go to your local check-cashing store, and one of its payday loans could cost you up to 400 percent in interest. So, while it may put a little money in your pocket for emergencies, that payday loan can obviously do a lot more harm than good.

What’s a better option than a 400 percent payday loan? An installment loan worth up to $500 that features lower interest rates. Where can you get such a loan? From Possible Finance.

Now, if you’ve never applied for a payday loan, you may be wondering why someone would opt for one when it can charge 400 percent interest. The answer is that it may have been the sole option if you have bad credit. That’s no longer the case, though, as Possible Finance does not check your credit, so bad credit is not an issue.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

Besides no credit check, another benefit of getting an installment loan from Possible Finance is the payment terms. Payday loans often expect payment in line with your next paycheck. A Possible Finance installment loan can usually be paid back in two months, which gives you a bit of breathing room.

Want another reason to opt for an installment loan? Think about your credit. If it’s bad and a low score is holding you back financially, you should do everything you can to increase your score and get good credit. When you get a Possible Finance installment loan and pay it back in four payments over a two-month period, you end up building your credit as well since it will be reported to the three credit bureaus. This helps you kill two birds with one stone by getting the cash you need and boosting your credit score.

As an aside, you may find that you need more than two weeks to make your first payment on the installment loan. If that’s the case, you can take up to 30 days without any fees or penalties.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Apply For a $500 Loan From Possible Finance</h4>
It only takes minutes to get approved for a possible $500 installment loan. You can start the process by <a href=""https://www.possiblefinance.com/installment-loans/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going to their official website</a> and downloading the app. Then, complete the steps that follow.

As with any financial move you make, be sure to read the fine print before making anything official. Since this is a loan, you will be charged interest, although you can look forward to it being less than a payday loan.","Do you need cash now?

Well, now’s the time to get going, and these tips will help make your travels a lot more affordable.
<h4>1. Save 25 cents per gallon on gas.</h4>
Do you cringe every time you fill up your car nowadays? If so, you’re certainly not alone, as gas prices have hit their highest level since 2014.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AdSense -->

While it looks like gas prices won’t be slowing down anytime soon, there is a way to pay less at the pump, and it involves downloading the GasBuddy app to your phone.

GasBuddy lets you find the nearest gas stations so you can fill up when you’re almost on E. More importantly, it lets you see who’s offering the lowest price, so you don’t overpay.

Even better, you can get a free gas card from GasBuddy.com to save up to 25 cents per gallon. Once you have the card, link it to your debit card and swipe it at the pump. The discount will then go directly to your bank account for immediate savings.

Want even more savings? If you have a fuel loyalty card from a gas station you frequent like Shell or Circle K, you can stack it with your GasBuddy card for an even deeper discount.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Pay zero for tolls.</h4>
Rising gas prices aren’t the only thing that’s making travel more expensive, as it seems as if tolls are going up too. Luckily, there are several ways to steer clear of tolls, making it easy to keep more money in your pocket.

If you want to take the old-fashioned route of creating your own driving route, head to TollGuru.com. It will show you where the tolls are in each state so you can go around them.

For a more hassle-free toll-avoiding approach, use the Waze app, MapQuest, or Google Maps on your phone. You can also use a GPS. Any one of those should have an option to avoid tolls in their settings, so you won’t have to fork over any cash on the way to your destination.
<h4>3. Save on food.</h4>
Unless you’re settled into a cozy Airbnb with a full kitchen, you probably won’t be doing any cooking during your road trip. And since eating out can be expensive, you should try to find deals and coupons to lower your food costs.

Netflix may be the king of streaming services, but Hulu is also making a name for itself. With over 40 million subscribers, Hulu is likely to go the way of Netflix soon. How? By not offering free access to its catalog for new customers, which is why you need to act now if you want to enjoy Hulu at no cost. Here are some tips to get it for free:

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>1. Sign up for a free trial.</h4>
Of all the ways to get free Hulu, this is the most common and straightforward. Why should you try it now? Because Netflix used to offer a free streaming trial. However, once it got overly popular, Netflix stopped offering trials, making it nearly impossible to enjoy what the service has without paying.

When you sign up for a free 30-day trial to Hulu, you’ll get access to its catalog for one month.
After one month, you will be charged for whatever subscription level you picked. It’s crucial to remember this if you just want the free month and have no intention of paying for Hulu in the future.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- AD03 -->

<h4>2. Ask for someone else’s login.</h4>
This tip is used by many to enjoy streaming services like Netflix and Hulu for free, or at the very least, at a reduced price. If you ask a friend or family member with a Hulu account for their login, you’ll be able to enjoy the service’s content either at no cost or by splitting the monthly subscription.

If you take this route, it’s vital to either make a watching schedule, so you don’t interfere, or select a more expensive plan. This is because the cheapest plan only allows for streaming on one device at a time.
<h4>3. Sign up for Sprint Unlimited.</h4>
Are you shopping for a new cell phone plan? Choose Sprint Unlimited, and you can get free Hulu as a perk for signing up.
<h4>4. Get Disney+.</h4>
If you have kids or want to relive your childhood, Disney+ is a streaming service that may be up your alley. While not free, getting a Disney+ bundle can give you access to that streaming service plus Hulu and ESPN+ for $12.99 per month. That’s not a bad price for content that should keep your entire family entertained.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>5. Search for Hulu coupons.</h4>
You may have luck finding coupons that’ll cut the cost of Hulu or land you a free trial. You can search for such coupons on sites like RetailMeNot.com, Coupons.com, or directly via Google.
<h4>6. Get a Hulu gift card.</h4>
Do you have a birthday coming up? Whether it’s yours or your kids’, be sure to let everyone know that you’d like to have Hulu in your home. In doing so, you can get a gift card on your special day and use it to pay for a Hulu subscription.","To enjoy what Hulu has to offer without paying, try these tips.","2021-09-01 00:57:07",post,https://mammothawards.com/want-free-hulu-do-this/,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1746746024.jpg,shutterstock_1746746024.jpg,/chroot/home/a5d2f909/mammothawards.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1746746024.jpg,5418,"Calgary,,Alberta.,Canada.,June,1,2020.,An,Ipad,With,The",,,,https://mammothawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1746746024.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,3,mawards,author@mammothsawards.com,Mammoth,Awards,want-free-hulu-do-this,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:00:49"
5420,"3 Ways To Get Cash Through Your Car","[the_ad_group id=""26""]<!-- AD01 -->

If you’ve been feeling down about your financial situation lately, look on the bright side: It’s never been easier to make money beyond a typical 9-5 job. Sure, you can make money on the Internet from the comfort of your couch by being a virtual assistant, filling out surveys, etc. But another sometimes overlooked avenue to earn extra cash is your car.

Although the list of ways to make cash with your car can be quite extensive, we’ve narrowed it down to three of the best methods that you can start implementing today to see more money in your bank account.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>1. Sell your car right now.</h4>
Okay, so selling your car at this moment may seem like it would put you in a bind. Here’s why we mention it, though: There’s never been a better time to sell a car.

New cars are having major issues getting to the lot due to a shortage of parts. With fewer new cars to choose from, people are turning to used cars as their vehicles of choice. What’s the problem there? The fact that the supply of used cars is limited. And when you get increased demand with a limited supply, you get high prices.

Statistics show that car dealers are paying a premium for pre-owned vehicles. Trade-ins are fetching twice the usual amount, and private buyers are paying 30 percent more for used cars. Combine those two stats, and you now see why it’s the perfect time to sell if you barely use your car, have a second vehicle, or have been looking to unload what you currently own for a while.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- AD03 -->

To get the ball rolling, give a local dealership a call. Tell them all the details about your car, such as the make, model, year, and condition. Then, say you’d like to sell it to the highest bidder.

If you’d rather sell on your own, there are plenty of ways to do so via sites like CarGurus.com, AutoTrader.com, Craigslist.org, Facebook Marketplace, etc.
<h4>2. Wrap your car in advertisements.</h4>
What do Wrapify.com and Carvertise.com have in common? Both are sites that pay people to drive around with advertisements on their cars.

You can earn up to $450 per month by signing up and having your car wrapped in ads. Depending on how much of your car is covered and the number of miles you’ll drive, you could make enough to pay off your car each month or take care of other bills.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>3. Rent out your car.</h4>
Studies show that travel is booming, with 60 percent more people hitting the road after being stuck inside for so long. This demand has led to a shortage in the rental car supply, which is why renting your car could be a lucrative way to make easy money.

Whether you have a sedan, SUV, or truck, you can list it on sites like Turo.com and Getaround.com to rent it out to others. You get to set the schedule, so it doesn’t interfere with your needs, plus you get to set the price. How much can you make by renting out your car? While you’re in charge of the fees, some people rent their vehicles out for as much as $100 per day.","Are you looking for ways to pad your income?

With the national eviction moratorium out the window, here’s what you should do to protect yourself.

Were you shocked when you found out that the Supreme Court voted to end the federal eviction moratorium? If so, you’re not alone, as it was estimated to protect nearly 90 percent of renters.

[the_ad id=""497""]<!-- AD02 -->

Joint filers who made less than $198,000 and single filers bringing in less than $99,000 enjoyed the protection the moratorium provided, as it helped them stay in their homes despite the negative financial impact caused by the pandemic. And even though the moratorium didn’t mean rent was free and late fees were erased, it’s tough to beat the peace of mind that comes from knowing you won’t end up on the streets.

With the eviction moratorium gone, you may be facing a significant problem with your landlord. And whether they’re requesting back rent or threatening to put you on the street, here are several resources that can lend a helping hand.
<h4>If You’re Facing Eviction:</h4>
Receiving an eviction notice at any time is difficult, but in the middle of a pandemic, it’s even worse. If your landlord has hit you with an eviction notice, your first step should be to check with your local government. Despite the ending of the national moratorium, some local governments have instituted eviction protections of their own during the pandemic.

[the_ad_group id=""27""] <!-- AD03 -->

For example, if you live in Los Angeles County, you know that a local moratorium banned commercial and residential evictions for a certain time. If your local government has something similar in place, you could get some much-needed breathing room to get that landlord off your back.

If you have no idea what the eviction laws are in your area, finding expert legal assistance may be your best move. <a href=""https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Legal Aid</a> may give you a free attorney if you haven’t paid rent in a long time and face eviction. DoNotPay.com’s online legal services chatbot can tell you what your rights are in terms of eviction right now. And if you want local help, JustShelter.org can connect you with nearby organizations that offer eviction assistance. With their help, you may be able to stay in your home or at least find emergency housing.

Those resources can help, as can a talk with your landlord. Even though they may be threatening you with legal action, asking for more affordable rent or paying past-due rent throughout next year could keep you in your home. If you think there’s no way they’d accept such offers, they might since evictions can be expensive and time-consuming.

[the_ad id=""506""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>If You Need Rent Assistance:</h4>
The Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program can clear up your housing situation by paying past rent, making future rent payments, and even paying utility bills and moving expenses. You can also find rent assistance from the National Low Income Housing Association. And lastly, if you fear that you’re about to be homeless, give 211 a call or <a href=""https://www.hudexchange.info/housing-and-homeless-assistance/homeless-help/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">look at this link from the HUD</a> that showcases emergency housing and shelters.","Millions could be facing eviction right now after falling behind on their rent payments.
