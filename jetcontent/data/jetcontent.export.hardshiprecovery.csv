35,"How To Open Your First Bank Account","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
If you’re tired of keeping your cash stashed in a box or under your mattress, a bank account may come in handy. Not only can it secure your money, but a bank account can make it easier to make purchases via a debit card as well.

While opening an account may sound intimidating if you’ve never done it before, it’s quite simple as long as you follow the tips in this article.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Basic Requirements to Open a Bank Account</h3>
Each bank will have its own set of requirements to screen applicants. There are specific laws, however, that lay out minimum requirements that must be met by most banks, such as:
<h4>1. You must be at least 18 years old.</h4>
To have a personal bank account, you’ll need to be 18 or older. If you are younger, you still have options, though.

Your bank may have accounts designated explicitly for minors as a way for youths to learn money management and secure them as customers down the line.

If your bank doesn’t have this option, you might be able to use a parent or legal guardian to open a joint account.
<h4>2. You must be a U.S. citizen.</h4>
Some banks will require that you have U.S. citizenship to open an account. Again, this may vary between banks, so do your research beforehand to figure out if you are a good fit.

With so many financial institutions out there, it’s never a good idea to quit looking if one can’t serve your needs.
<h4>3. Your financial history will be checked.</h4>
If you’ve had issues with banks before, it could affect your current application.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
For instance, a history of overdrafts could negatively impact your ability to get a new bank account. If a bank has closed one of your accounts in the past, that could make it tougher to open a new account as well.
<h3>Where to Open a Bank Account</h3>
You can walk into your local bank branch to open an account, or you can search for institutions that will let you complete the process online.
<h3>What to Bring When Opening Your Account</h3>
Bring these documents on your trip, and you should walk out with a brand new bank account as long as you meet the requirements:

Photo identification – A state-issued driver’s license is the most common form of ID used to open a new account. A passport will also suffice. If you have neither, use your state ID, which you can get from your local DMV.

Proof of address – Bring paperwork that has your address on it, such as a utility bill, lease agreement, or mortgage statement.

Social Security card – Bringing your SSN card is sometimes required. If you don’t have an SSN, you’ll need to get an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the IRS.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Initial deposit – Once your application is accepted, many banks will require that you leave a minimum deposit to make it all official. Call the bank or look online to see what their minimum deposit is beforehand.","How do you open a bank account? What type of documents do you need to bring to complete the process?

38,"5 Dying Jobs You Can Convert Into A New Career","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
While a doctor seems like a job that will stay important into perpetuity, other professions are not so lucky. Lamplighters, bowling alley pinsetters, and ice cutters are a few examples of tasks that no longer exist, and that list is sure to grow as technology takes over.

If you find yourself in a job that’s set to be phased out soon, know that it’s not the end of the world. You have specific skills that you use to do that job, and those skills can be transferred to something else.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are some examples of dying jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that can lead to other forms of employment:
<h4>1. Executive Assistants</h4>
This position is expected to decline in demand over the next ten years. At the same time, similar positions are expected to experience job growth. In other words, losing your executive assistant post could lead to something better.

You could become a billing or posting clerk. You could also become a legal assistant or paralegal, as all of these posts will need to be filled to meet their growing demand.
<h4>2. Mail Carriers</h4>
Have you noticed fewer letters in your mailbox? As companies transition to online billing, you’ll see even less physical mail in the years to come, provided you don’t order from Amazon daily.

While Amazon will almost inevitably grow, fewer letters and similar mailbox clutter will lead to a decline in postal service carriers.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
The good news in this realm is that similar jobs will grow. Examples are messengers and couriers, plus delivery drivers.
<h4>3. Bank Tellers</h4>
Online banking makes financial transactions more convenient for consumers. On the flip side, the move to online banking lessens the need for in-person bank tellers.

If you are currently a bank teller who’s worried about the future, you could transition into work as an information clerk or receptionist. Both carry similar average salaries than tellers and are expected to grow steadily over the next ten years.

You could also work as a health information technician or in medical records. While those jobs are in a different field, they require similar skill sets and come with an average pay that’s around $10,000 higher than tellers.
<h4>4. Typists</h4>
Typing is a skill that translates across many industries, so if you’re a typist or word processor, don’t fret. Yes, those jobs are expected to experience a deep decline in demand, but the skills can still translate into other work with similar pay.

Become an insurance claims clerk, or look into medical records jobs. Both will need workers in the coming years, so keep an eye out.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Travel Agents</h4>
The Internet makes it incredibly easy to book hotels, flights, and other travel-related services. As such, being a travel agent in the near future isn’t ideal in terms of job security.

While you may not help people book trips anymore, you can use your travel agent skills for two higher-paying jobs: loan officer and customs broker. Both will see growth in the next decade, and you can nearly double your travel agent income with either post.","Are you at a “dying” job that has you worried about your future?

41,"4 Things To Consider Before Choosing A New Bank","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
Maybe you’re fed up with your current bank’s poor customer service, high fees, or lack of available ATMs. Or perhaps you’re <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/how-to-open-your-first-bank-account/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">looking for a place to stash your cash</a> instead of under the mattress. Regardless of why you need a new bank, you’ll need to research your options before sticking to one.

What should you look for in a financial institution? Here are some of the basics:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Banks versus credit unions.</h4>
Banks are for-profit, while credit unions are nonprofit. While you may not be too worried about that distinction, you’d probably like to know how each stacks up to one another.

In terms of interest, credit unions often offer higher rates on checking and savings accounts, so you can earn more on keeping your money in one versus a bank.

Credit unions also tend to offer lower fees than banks. Some may have free checking and savings accounts, while banks may charge a monthly maintenance fee for the same services.

Beyond maintenance fees, you’ll have to consider the possibility of overdraft fees. Banks tend to charge higher in this regard, so when it comes to fees in general, credit unions may be the more attractive option.

If you’re going to need a loan from your financial institution, a credit union could be the better option. Many credit unions offer lower interest rates on personal loans, car loans, and home loans than banks do. You could find it easier to get a credit card from a bank, however.

Are you looking for rewards when making purchases with your money? Banks often win this department, so if you’re seeking cash-back perks, keep them in mind.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
In terms of convenience, banks tend to be more widespread, while credit unions are local. This could be an issue if you travel a lot and need nationwide access to your cash via ATMs or branches.

Since credit unions are more local, their customer service often beats banks. Your mileage may vary here, however, especially if you’re looking at a small bank that’s strong in customer service.

Lastly, a bank may be easier to join, as credit unions can sometimes limit membership to specific employers, locations, and the like.
<h4>2. Online versus brick and mortar.</h4>
Do you want more face-to-face time with the people holding your money? If so, a bank or credit union with actual locations you can visit may be your best bet.

If you don’t mind talking to customer service reps over the phone, however, an online bank may suffice.

Such banks may incur ATM fees due to a lack of locations, though, so keep that in mind. You can check beforehand if an online bank reimburses ATM fees to play it safe.
<h4>3. Compare perks.</h4>
As stated above, banks and credit unions bring different benefits to the table. You’ll want to weigh the advantages and disadvantages each prospective institution has before deciding on one.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Personal opinions and online reviews.</h4>
Ask friends, family, and coworkers if they can recommend any banks or credit unions. Personal recommendations are great for gaining insight into how an institution works and treats its customers.

You can also look for reviews online. If you notice plenty of bad reviews for a particular institution, stay away. Doing so will help you prevent a future financial headache.","Are you unsatisfied with your current bank or looking to open your very first account?

44,"How To Switch To A New Bank","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
Moving your cash to a new bank could be a smart move if the one you currently use isn’t cutting it.

Maybe you’re tired of the lack of ATM locations that make it almost impossible to access your money when you need it. Perhaps your current bank gouges you with ultra-high overdraft and maintenance fees. Or maybe you want to earn more interest on your savings.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Regardless of why you’re changing banks, there are some steps you’ll have to follow to complete the task. Luckily, they’re not too difficult in this day and age, so let’s jump into them now:
<h4>1. Open the new account ahead of time.</h4>
If you’re dependent on your current bank account for several payments, opening the new one a few weeks before you’ll have to use it is a good idea.

Each bank is different, so it may take some time for you to get acquainted with the new institution’s procedures. By opening your new account with some time to spare, you can learn how to use it and get everything set up without feeling rushed. If not, you could start on the wrong foot by getting hit with overdraft fees or not paying specific bills on time.

Whether opening your bank account online or in person, know that you’ll need specific documents to complete the process, such as your government-issued ID.
<h4>2. Transfer your automatic payments.</h4>
Auto pay makes it easy to avoid missing payments and damaging your credit score. If your current account has automatic payments, you’ll need to review them and transfer each over to your new account once it is up and running.

To ensure you don’t miss any payments, look over the past year of bank statements and mark off each instance of existing auto pays that must be transferred.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Here are some examples of auto pays you may find:
<ul>
 	<li>Rent/mortgage</li>
 	<li>Car payment/car insurance</li>
 	<li>Utilities such as electric, water, and gas</li>
 	<li>Student or other loan payments</li>
 	<li>Gym or other memberships</li>
 	<li>Online subscriptions</li>
 	<li>Cable bill</li>
 	<li>Internet bill</li>
 	<li>Cell phone bill</li>
 	<li>Credit card payments</li>
</ul>
When updating auto pay information, try to get an email confirmation for each move. It could help if you run into any trouble later on and need evidence to avoid or remove negative reports on your credit history.
<h4>3. Update your direct deposit information.</h4>
The last thing you need when switching banks is to lack access to your paycheck. If your employer pays you via direct deposit, you’ll need to contact them to update the bank account info they have on file.

Paychecks aren’t the only direct deposits you’ll need to update. If you receive child support or any other form of payment in this way, be sure to update it as well.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Move your money.</h4>
With your new account open and all of the auto pay and direct deposit info updated, it’s now time to transfer your money.

Some banks allow you to transfer money to a new account for free. Others, however, may not be so accommodating.

To avoid any convenience fees, ask your old bank for a check that you can use to transfer the money.
<h4>5. Close your old bank account – but not immediately.</h4>
Wait at least one to two months to close your old bank account. As long as your automatic payments and direct deposits go through without error, you’ll be good to go.

To avoid any issues with opening new accounts in the future, make sure your old account is free of any outstanding balances.","Are you ready to move your money to a new bank? Follow these five steps to streamline the process.","2020-08-13 04:41:06",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/how-to-switch-to-a-new-bank/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_394804099.jpg,shutterstock_394804099.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_394804099.jpg,45,shutterstock_394804099,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_394804099.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,how-to-switch-to-a-new-bank,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-09 13:28:45"
47,"Why Direct Deposit Is A Must If You Want To Start Saving","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
The more automated your savings are, the more likely they are to grow. Why? Well, manually putting away money for an emergency fund or down the road takes loads of discipline, especially with so many ways to spend it.

How can you automate savings? On a small scale, you can use apps that will transfer change debit purchases to a savings account. You can schedule monthly transfers from your checking to savings, too, if you’re looking to put away more.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While those options certainly work, there’s another option that takes less time and takes the responsibility of saving out of your hands: Direct deposit from your employer.

The company you work for may have a direct deposit feature that you’re not taking advantage of. According to a 2015 NACHA survey of 2,000 workers, 82 percent used direct deposit. Of that group, however, only 24 percent divided their direct deposit between multiple accounts. In other words, nearly three out of four failed to use it to save.
<h4>The Purpose of a Split Deposit</h4>
What can you use a split deposit for? The most common use is to build an emergency fund, which is a good idea in case you have a loss of income or unexpected medical bills one day.

You could also use a split deposit to grow a savings account for a specific purpose slowly. For instance, you may want to buy a new home in the next few years or purchase a car. You could add to that savings account via a split direct deposit through your employer.

Does a split deposit have to go to a savings account? No, as you could redirect some of your paycheck to another checking account for spending purposes.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
If you think a direct deposit isn’t necessary to save, you may be right if you have strong financial discipline. What if you don’t, however? By eliminating the need to choose what to do with your money, direct deposit instills the discipline for you.
<h4>How to Set up Direct Deposit with Your Employer</h4>
When you’re ready for direct deposit to start stacking your savings, contact your company’s human resources department. You may be able to set it up online, or you’ll have to fill out some forms.

You’ll probably need to have certain pieces of information handy when making the switch. Your account and routing numbers will be required, and some cases may require a voided check to complete the process.

If your pay varies from time to time, you can ask for a percentage of it to be used for direct deposit instead of an exact amount. Doing so will ensure you have enough left in your checking for bills and other necessities if a period pays less than usual.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

To help you reach your savings goals, here’s a little trick that seems to help many people: Naming your savings account.

For example, you may have a savings account saved up for a special vacation with your partner. Name it “Vacation Fund” to give it an actual purpose and identity. In doing so, you’ll label it with a goal you’d like to reach, which may motivate you to save even more.","It takes a lot of discipline to stash away cash and save instead of spending it. Thanks to direct deposit, such control isn’t necessary.","2020-08-13 00:41:59",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/why-direct-deposit-is-a-must-if-you-want-to-start-saving/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1114534085.jpg,shutterstock_1114534085.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1114534085.jpg,48,shutterstock_1114534085,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1114534085.jpg,"Financial Help","FHA Assistance",publish,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,why-direct-deposit-is-a-must-if-you-want-to-start-saving,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-11 20:38:45"
50,"How “Freecycling” Can Help You Find Free Clothing Fast","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
If you’ve never heard of freecycling, you can probably figure out what it is by just looking at its name. The term combines the words “free” and “recycling,” and it refers to the act of giving unwanted items to others instead of throwing them away.
<h4>The Benefits of Freecycling</h4>
Freecycling has two obvious benefits:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

It prevents unnecessary waste that could overflow landfills and negatively impact the environment.
It gives items to people in need who don’t have the money to pay for them.

What’s one of the best ways to use freecycling to your advantage? To get free clothing, which can be a necessity if you’re having trouble paying your bills every month.

Is the clothing you’ll find via freecycling completely dirty, as if it just came out of a dumpster? Absolutely not. In fact, you’ll be surprised at the quality of free clothing you’ll find via freecycling, plus other things such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Baby supplies</li>
 	<li>Free books</li>
 	<li>Furniture</li>
 	<li>Craft supplies</li>
 	<li>Collectibles</li>
 	<li>And much more…</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why People Donate Perfectly Good Items</h4>
It may seem odd that people would give away expensive items like furniture and collectibles for free. Many times, however, they do it to save money involved with having to sell or transport items they no longer need.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
If a family member passes, for example, a person may need to move an entire house of furniture. If they have nowhere to put it, donating to people who need the furniture most is a better option than selling it or paying a moving and storage company to hold it.
<h4>Where to Find Free Clothing and Other Freecycled Items</h4>
To find free clothes and other no-cost goodies that can save your budget and family, look no further than the Freecycle Network.

The site operates worldwide, with over nine million members and over 5,000 groups. Local volunteers moderate each group, and you can sign up for free.

Navigating the Freecycle Network is rather self-explanatory. You can find free clothing and any other items in two ways.

The first method is to do a simple search on the site for whatever item you need. So, if you need new clothes for your baby, you can type in a search for “baby clothes.” You can also browse through all of the listings to see what’s new.

The second method of finding free clothing and other products is to make a post. Include what you’re looking for, plus a reason why you need it, and someone can swoop in to help.

The bigger your city, the more likely you are to find loads of freecycled stuff. The smaller it is, the harder it may be to find what you are looking for.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

It’s worth noting that you’ll need a free membership to perform a search. And if you don’t find what you’re looking for, try searching for locations near you. Since the items are free, a little drive may be worth the gas money.

Before you jump into Freecycle, have an open mind. There are people out there looking to help others. Even though free items like clothes and washing machines may seem like a scam, you can discover that they’re 100 percent legit.","You can save the environment and save some money by getting free clothing via freecycling.","2020-08-13 04:42:59",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/how-freecycling-can-help-you-find-free-clothing-fast/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1022661760.jpg,shutterstock_1022661760.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1022661760.jpg,51,shutterstock_1022661760,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1022661760.jpg,"Work From Home",,publish,5,sferreira,sferreira@hardshiprecovery.com,Sam,Ferreira,how-freecycling-can-help-you-find-free-clothing-fast,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-09 13:28:47"
53,"6 Tips To Make Dental Care More Affordable","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
What’s one place most humans like to avoid? The dentist’s office, and with good reason. Not only can it be painful depending on the procedure, but it can also be extremely expensive and put a dent in your budget.

What are the best ways to minimize the impact your teeth have on your bottom line? Here they are:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Start with preventative maintenance.</h4>
Free or low-cost dental care can sometimes be hard to find. That’s why preventative maintenance is a must. If you take good care of your teeth, you can reduce the risk of needing costly dental care down the line.

As basic as these tips may seem, some people refuse to follow them, which can result in hefty trips to the dentist. If you know you’re lacking in any of the following, it’s time to get serious before it’s too late:
<ul>
 	<li>Brush your teeth twice daily.</li>
 	<li>Floss regularly.</li>
 	<li>Use mouthwash.</li>
 	<li>Reduce your consumption of sugary drinks and candy.</li>
</ul>
Those are preventative measures you can do at home to cut dental costs. But you can also minimize the risk of costly procedures by going to the dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned.

On average, you should try to get your teeth cleaned at least once a year. Even better, aim for once every six months.

While each visit can incur a cost, catching any potential problems before they get worse can help you save in the long run. Filling a cavity costs less than a root canal or crown, plus it’s a lot less painful.
<h4>2. Pay in cash.</h4>
Some dentists will give you a cash discount if you ask them. They’ll do so since it reduces the number of billing issues and credit card fees they have to deal with.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Paying in cash and saving a few bucks can be particularly helpful if you’re traveling or don’t have dental insurance, so be sure to ask if it’s an option.
<h4>3. Try payments.</h4>
Some dental work is unavoidable and must be done, regardless of your finances. If you don’t have a credit card and are short on cash, ask your dentist if you can set up a payment plan for the work to be performed.

Some dentists may be willing to work with you, and this option is better than going into debt to get your teeth fixed.
<h4>4. Create a doable strategy.</h4>
Do you have a lot of dental work that needs to be done? Before you get flustered and wonder how you’ll pay for it, ask your dentist to come up with a strategy.

For instance, what work can be put off for later? What must be done now?

Since your dentist is the expert, they can tell you what to focus on first that fits your finances. You can then get the other work done when you’re able to pay for it.
<h4>5. Solicit the help of students.</h4>
Dentists didn’t become professionals overnight. They had to work at their craft, and guess who they usually experiment on? Living, breathing humans like yourself.

If you go to a dental school, you can get work done at a significant discount. And before you worry about something going wrong, know that instructors are supervising the students.

Is going to a school the same as finding a free dental clinic? No, but the discounts can be deep enough to help you score significant savings.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Get a dental discount plan.</h4>
Is your employer’s dental insurance too expensive? Do they not offer dental insurance at all? Either way, you can still get the coverage you need by purchasing a dental discount plan.

As long as you can afford a small annual fee in the neighborhood of $100, you can get a substantial discount on your dental work as long as you choose an in-network dentist.","Your teeth can become quite costly if you don’t take care of them.

If you have problems saving money, you know how they can come back to bite you when it’s time to pay bills. Or, even worse, you know how a lack of saved money in an emergency fund can lead to loads of unwanted debt.

While you may not have had the fortune of learning to save at an early age, that doesn’t mean you can’t give your children that gift.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Of course, if you can barely make ends meet, starting a “savings challenge” with your kids may seem like a dream. With the Penny Challenge, however, it can become your reality.
<h4>What is the Penny Challenge?</h4>
Just like its name suggests, the Penny Challenge has you save pennies. Why do it? So you can start to stack savings and end up with a pleasant little surprise once the next 365 days are over.

Can you just save one penny per day and complete the challenge? You could, but you wouldn’t finish it as intended. And you also wouldn’t end up with much since $3.65 saved won’t get you far.

How much should you have stashed away to start the Penny Challenge? One penny, and to continue it, you’ll have to add one penny to that amount each day for an entire year.

If this seems confusing, it isn’t. One day one, put one penny into a piggy bank or some other savings receptacle. On day two, add two pennies to that amount. On day three, add three pennies, and keep going for 365 days.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
As you can probably tell, your biggest piggy bank contribution will be on day 365, totaling a whopping $3.65. That’s not too bad in terms of being the most significant deposit, but you’re probably wondering, how much can you end up with?

Do the Penny Challenge for a full year, and you and your kids can have $667.95 saved. Do the math yourself, and you’ll come up with that figure as you add $0.01 plus $0.02 and so on for 365 days.
<h4>Doing the Penny Challenge With Your Children</h4>
Will your kids have enough money to do the challenge on their own? Probably not, since on the final week, a total of $28.92 will have to be deposited. This may be too much if they’re very young, but if they’re teens with a job, it’s certainly doable.

Even if it’s with your own money, doing the Penny Challenge daily with children teaches them the importance of saving. And once the challenge is finished, it can show them how putting just a little bit away can lead to big rewards later on.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Planting this financial seed in your kids’ minds can set them up for success. It can give them the nudge they need to start saving at a young age, and the younger they start, the earlier they can retire.","The faster your kids start to learn about money and saving, the better off they’ll be.

60,"If You’re Having Trouble Saving, Try This","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
Have you suddenly come to the realization that you have no money saved for a rainy day? It could come back to bite you if you have to use your credit card or take out an expensive loan to cover an emergency.

While many say you should have three to six months' worth of expenses saved in your emergency fund, that may seem like too daunting of a task.

To get you on the slow and steady path towards saving, try these methods that are easy to do and don’t require a ton of money.
<h4>The No-Spend Challenge</h4>
You don’t need extra money to start saving with the no-spend challenge. You just need to – as its name suggests – stop spending for a while.

Will you still have to spend on necessities like your monthly bills? Of course, but you’ll freeze spending on things like eating out, buying new clothes, going to the movies, and other luxuries.

If you want to take this challenge to the extreme, try to avoid spending during the holidays. As difficult as it sounds, you can do it by exchanging time and companionship with your friends and family instead of gifts.

Do the No-Spend Challenge during the holidays, and you’ll give yourself the gift of no new debt once the new year begins.
<h4>The Pantry Challenge</h4>
Do you feel as if you spend too much of your monthly budget on groceries? Are you always throwing out food that has spoiled? If so, the Pantry Challenge could be just what the doctor ordered.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Chances are, you have enough food in your pantry to last you for a while. The Pantry Challenge uses this to help you save on buying new groceries.

For one week, try to survive on whatever is in your pantry or fridge. This will help you save weekly grocery money, plus avoid waste.
<h4>The 52-Week Money Challenge</h4>
Could you sock away one dollar this week and put it towards your savings? How about two dollars next week? And three dollars the week after that?

You probably could achieve those less than lofty goals. And if you follow that pattern for 52 weeks, you can add $1,378 to your savings at the end of one year.

The 52-Week Money Challenge works because it doesn’t take copious cash to start. Since it has you save a bit more per week, it also gets you in the habit of saving so you can make it a regular occurrence well into the future.
<h4>The Five-Dollar Challenge</h4>
If the thought of having to save every week has you feeling squeamish, try the $5 Challenge instead.

It will have you saving on occasion, but the challenge can still leave you with a decent amount of dough once the year is finished.

To complete the $5 Challenge, save any five-dollar bill you get as change from a cashier. Even if you manage to keep just a couple of $5 bills per week, you can end up with $520 at the end of 52 weeks.","Saving doesn’t come easy for some. Try the methods in this article, however, and it could become second nature.","2020-08-13 04:45:59",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/?p=60,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_132478748.jpg,shutterstock_132478748.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_132478748.jpg,61,shutterstock_132478748,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_132478748.jpg,Resources,"FHA Assistance",draft,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,if-youre-having-trouble-saving-try-this,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:55:43"
63,"The Best Times Of Year To Buy New Items For Your Home","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
When do most people buy new products like appliances, furniture, and more for their home? Either when they have breaks, or when a holiday like Black Friday hits.

Well, did you know that you could score significant savings on products by buying them at certain times of the year? It’s true, as many products follow a pattern that makes them predictable in terms of their lowest prices.

If you were looking to buy something to make your home more modern, efficient, or simply better overall, here are the times when you should break out your wallet.
<h4>Televisions</h4>
Try to hold off the urge to splurge on the newest, biggest TV on Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Instead, buy it in January.

You can discover deep discounts during this month on televisions right after the latest, greatest technologies are revealed at the yearly Consumer Electronics Show. Since it kicks off in early January, it makes waiting just a bit longer well worth it.
<h4>Linens</h4>
Sheets and other linens are best bought in January.

Although white sales that feature linens at deep discounts have been going on since the 1800s, don’t worry – you can find them in every color just after the new year kicks off.
<h4>Mattresses</h4>
You can buy your linens in January and buy the bed to put them on in February. Presidents Day is ideal for mattress shopping since it’s a long weekend that’s filled with beds at affordable prices.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Fitness Equipment</h4>
You may be tempted to buy a new treadmill or some other piece of workout equipment in January. Buy it in March instead, and you can get it at a discount as all those new year’s resolutions fall through.
<h4>Tools</h4>
If you have someone handy around the house, have them buy their tools in April. Head on over to Home Depot, and you can take advantage of their Spring Black Friday sale to snag some deals.
<h4>Refrigerators</h4>
Do you need this year’s latest refrigerator? Probably not, as last year’s could suffice.

Buy your refrigerator in May, and you can get it at a lower price since new fridge models hit the market in the summer.
<h4>Cookware and dishes</h4>
Do you know what June is? Besides being extremely hot in most places, it’s also wedding season.

Retailers pack stores with wedding registry gifts like cookware and dishes, and many of them can be found on the cheap.
<h4>Indoor furniture</h4>
Need a new couch or table? Fourth of July weekend is your best bet for buying affordable furniture as retailers get rid of their inventory to make way for the latest styles that debuts in August.
<h4>Patio furniture</h4>
Complete your home’s décor by buying your patio furniture in October. With winter on the way, retailers drop prices since many people won’t be sitting around outside in the cold.
<h4>Small appliances</h4>
Start stocking up on small appliances as gifts in November. If you’ll be needing a coffee maker, blender, or something similar, get it around Black Friday.
<h4>Swimming pools</h4>
If you’ve been saving for one, get it installed in December when prices for pools hit rock-bottom since contractors have more free time.","You can save a ton on household goods if you purchase them at the right time.

66,"How Getting Rid Of Your Car Can Save You Major Money Every Month","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
Do you squirm when making your car payment every month as you watch it drain dollars from your budget? Does filling up your gas tank hurt too?

If so, it may be time to say goodbye to your automobile and hello to another form of transportation.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Affordable Alternatives to Cars</h3>
What are your options besides owning a car? The most obvious is public transportation.

This may be your best bet if you live in a big city, such as New York City, where the cost of owning a car is too high due to tolls, parking, expensive gas, and more. With so many options like the bus and subway at your disposal, you may find going carless as being the easier route.

If the thought of depending on public transportation doesn’t tickle your fancy, you could choose a car alternative.

For instance, bicycles can be a great way to get from point A to B while making you healthier via exercise. If you like adrenaline, a motorcycle may be the way to go. Scooters could be viable too, or, if you live close to everything, your own two feet may suffice.

Does getting rid of your car seem too drastic? It may not seem so severe once you realize the costs of owning one.

In 2018, the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics found that the average cost of owning a car was approximately $9,000 per every 15,000 miles.

Does that seem high? Know that it doesn’t even include things like your car payment, tolls, and parking fees.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
How can owning a car be so expensive without including your car note? Because there are other automobile-related expenses such as finance charges, depreciation, insurance, taxes, license fees, registration, tires, maintenance, and fuel.

Seeing that the cost of car ownership is so high may have you jumping at the bit to say goodbye to yours. While it may make sense in your situation, there are a few things to remember:
<h3>The Costs of Ditching Your Car for Other Forms of Transportation</h3>
<h4>1. Alternate vehicle costs.</h4>
Does transitioning to a bike, scooter, motorcycle, or even walking sound like a smart move? Know that each carries its own costs, including walking.

You’ll have to maintain a bike, scooter, or motorcycle with tires and the like. You’ll even have to maintain your own two feet with new shoes.
<h4>2. The cost of convenience.</h4>
A car gives you the power to go where you want when you want, even if the weather is terrible. Without one, you may be calling a taxi or Uber to haul you around if its stormy outside.

What about when you shop? How will you carry all of your groceries home? A car may be your only way, meaning that taxi or Uber might be necessary once again.

In short, you may have to use a car at times. Since it won’t be yours, you’ll have to remember that potential cost in your calculations.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Public transportation costs.</h4>
Buses, trains, trolleys, shuttles, subways, and any other forms of public transportation will probably require a ticket.

Will it be free? That’s not likely, so find out how much your preferred method of public transportation will cost you before unloading your car for good.","Is getting rid of your car in favor of other forms of transportation a good idea?

69,"4 Rules For Finding Scam-Free Freebies Online","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
The Internet makes it incredibly easy to save. Within seconds, you can not only find the product you’re looking for, but possibly find a discount on it as well.

Unfortunately, scammers know that people are continually seeking ways to snag free stuff online. And they use this to lace the Web with scams that can separate you from your money or identity.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While we don’t advise skipping out on freebies altogether due to scams, we do suggest taking the following precautions to keep your personal information and money safe.
<h4>1. If it’s too good to be true, leave it alone.</h4>
Do you know how they say that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is? Well, that saying comes in extra handy when talking about freebies.

Can you find free stuff online? Absolutely. But most of the time, people or companies aren’t going to give something incredibly valuable away for free. If it’s a few dollars, however, then it’s more likely to be legitimate.

As tempting as it may be, stay away from freebies that offer high monetary value in the form of cash or coupons or valuable gifts, such as a car or house.

You may see promises for such free rewards if you fill out a form. But instead of getting that reward, you’ll only get bombarded with offers for things or services you don’t want.

Even worse, your information could be sold to someone else, which could lead to annoying solicitation or eventual identity theft.
<h4>2. Use reputable sites.</h4>
Big brands and stores like Kraft or Walmart may give out occasional free items. It’s a way of building brand loyalty or getting feedback on a product before it’s produced on a broader scale.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Smaller brands can do the same to grow their presence. But as they offer free things, remember rule one. If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is. And if it’s from an unknown site, then you’re better off moving on.

Keep this rule in mind before filling out any forms or revealing any of your data. Scammers will do anything they can to entice you into giving up info so they can steal it and share it with others.
<h4>3. If it’s free, you shouldn’t have to pay for it.</h4>
The whole purpose of hunting for online freebies is to not pay a penny for the product. If they lead you down a path that eventually requires taking out your credit card, move on.

While asking for an upfront payment for a processing fee or to buy something is a no-no, companies can also hook you by offering a free trial.

Some may do this so you try their product and become a loyal customer. Others will do it knowing you’ll probably forget to cancel the trial so they can charge you. Also, they may just steal your credit card info when you enter it into a form.

In short, when any money or financial info is requested, it’s time to find a real freebie and not a fake one.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Keep certain information under lock and key.</h4>
If you genuinely want to play it safe, never reveal your social security number or your credit card information. Both are highly valuable to scammers. You may be asked for your address and name to receive the freebie, which is fine.

Also, if you really want to protect your privacy, make up an email account specifically for your freebie signups and searches. It will let you test the waters while remaining incognito.","The Internet is full of freebies. As you search for them, however, here are some rules you’ll want to follow to avoid being scammed.","2020-08-13 04:48:22",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/4-rules-for-finding-scam-free-freebies-online/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144275002.jpg,shutterstock_144275002.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144275002.jpg,70,shutterstock_144275002,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144275002.jpg,"Work From Home",,publish,5,sferreira,sferreira@hardshiprecovery.com,Sam,Ferreira,4-rules-for-finding-scam-free-freebies-online,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-06-10 14:49:18"
72,"5 Times When You Should Check Your Credit Report","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
<h3>The Importance of Getting Your Free Credit Report Every Year</h3>
You probably visit your doctor or dentist yearly to see where you stand in terms of health. This helps you figure out what you need to improve to avoid any issues down the line. And while health is crucial to your well-being, credit could be considered the same.

Just like those annual check-ups, you want to make sure your credit is in good standing. That’s why getting your free yearly credit report is a must so you can take any necessary measures to improve your score.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Why is a high credit score so important? Because it makes it easier to secure loans and credit so you can buy things you need now. And good credit can also help you find housing, whether you’re looking to rent or buy.

While getting your free annual credit report every 12 months is crucial so you can see how creditors view you as a borrower, here are four other times to check your score too.
<h3>Other Times When You Should Check Your Credit Report</h3>
<h4>1. When you think you’ve been a victim of identity theft.</h4>
Have you been receiving letters or phone calls from collection agencies regarding accounts you know you’ve never opened? If so, someone may have stolen your identity.

While identity theft is common, that doesn’t make it any less scary. And if you suspect you’ve been the victim of it, you should check your credit report immediately.

When checking your report, look for suspicious accounts. Report any that you see to the credit reporting agencies.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
The rise of identity theft is perhaps the most important reason for checking your credit score periodically. By not checking it, you put yourself at risk of being an identity theft victim and not even knowing it until an application for credit is denied.
<h4>2. When you’re about to make a significant purchase on credit.</h4>
Do you plan on buying a home or car soon? If those purchases will be made with a loan, you should check your credit report six months before applying.

By checking your credit in advance, you get to clean up any mistakes on accounts you’ve already paid. You can also pay off balances that could improve your score, so can you get approved for a loan.
<h4>3. When you’re denied for new credit.</h4>
If you’re denied a loan for a home, car, or some other large purchase, the law says you get to know why.

Within 10 business days, you should get a letter from the lender offering their reasons for rejection. The letter should also tell you how to get your free credit report so you can spot any issues.

If you find you were rejected due to mistakes on your credit report, dispute the errors with the companies in question and reporting bureaus. Once your report is fixed, you can have it sent to the lender to improve your chances of approval.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. When you’re looking to fix your credit.</h4>
Would you like to make a plan to get out of debt or repair your credit? Making that plan without seeing your credit report can be impossible.

Get your free report first, and you can see which problems need the most attention.","With free annual credit reports, there’s no reason not to check your score at least once every 12 months.

75,"8 Tips To Make The Mall More Affordable","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
The mall gets a bad rap for being expensive, especially when compared to online shopping avenues. Is this really true, however?

Not necessarily, because malls still need to attract customers, and they do so by being competitive with their brick-and-mortar and even online counterparts.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

What are some ways you can make mall shopping more affordable? Here are various tricks that could result in significant savings:
<h4>1. Browse your local Sunday newspaper.</h4>
As “old fashioned” as it may seem, scanning your Sunday paper can still result in some very nice savings.

Department stores continue to use Sunday newspapers as one of their most prominent advertising options. You can clip some coupons in them that could reduce the size of your receipts.
<h4>2. Keep store coupons in your car.</h4>
Whether the coupons come from the Sunday paper or were printed online, always keep them in your car. That way, once you arrive at the mall, you still have those savings with you.
<h4>3. Get friendly with store associates.</h4>
You can get valuable insider information on discounts from the people who work in the stores.

Exchange numbers with an associate and tell them to call you when a specific item gets marked down. They may even hold it for you if it’s quite popular and has a high risk of flying off the shelves during a sale.

Most stores don’t randomly launch sales or discounts. Instead, they have a set schedule they go by.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Ask an associate what that schedule is like, and you can always know the best times to shop for the biggest discounts.
<h4>4. Join mailing lists.</h4>
If you’re not too keen on chasing deals, you can have them chase you by signing up for a store’s mailing list.

This is often as simple as giving them your email address via their website. In exchange, they’ll send you coupons and information on sales when they become available.
<h4>5. Ask for coupons when checking out.</h4>
It never hurts to ask the cashier if they have any extra coupons or discounts that can be applied to your purchase.
<h4>6. Be aware of price protection.</h4>
Prices increase and decrease often. If you purchase a product and its price drops within a specified period, you could get a refund of the difference.

Read your receipts or ask an associate about their price protection policies, as it can ensure you always pay the lowest possible price.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Get discounts on damaged merchandise.</h4>
Sometimes a tiny bit of damage can lead to huge savings on a product. As long as the damage can be fixed, you may want to ask the store manager if they can sell it to you for a lower price.

Just like with coupons and the cashier when checking out, it never hurts to ask.
<h4>8. Use an app.</h4>
A host of apps now exist that can help you find the lowest prices for products in real-time. By installing one on your smartphone, you can see which stores deserve your deal-seeking attention that day.

One example of a shopping app that is useful in malls is Shopkick.","Do you prefer shopping in-person at the mall versus online?

Here are five instances where debt can become a bad thing, however, and should be avoided at all costs.

There are certain things you just can’t buy with cash if you don’t have a considerable income or substantial savings.

A house is a perfect example of this, but taking out debt to buy a home isn’t so bad. Why? First, you can use it to put a roof over your family’s head for several years. And second, it can appreciate in value.

Have you made it a habit of starting every year not only broke, but also with loads of brand new debt? If so, you can probably blame that on excessive holiday spending and buying tons of gifts using credit cards or even loans.

While you may get plenty of joy when giving gifts, you don’t want to do it while putting yourself in debt. Doing so can create a hole that’s impossible to climb out of. And it could make it impossible to pay your essential monthly expenses.

Whether it’s Christmas or any other holiday, set a strict budget for spending and stick to it. And remember, the holidays should be about the experience and spending time together, not material things.
<h4>2. Vacations.</h4>
There’s nothing quite like going on a relaxing vacation and coming back to a big bill. That’s why you’re better off saving up for a vacation and using cash versus putting it on credit.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Use a sinking fund to pay for the vacation. This is where you estimate the total cost of your trip and divide it by the number of months until it begins. That number will tell you how much extra money you’ll need to save every month to make the debt-free trip a reality.
<h4>3. New cars.</h4>
Yes, that new car smell and the thought of you being the first behind the wheel can be intoxicating. But, when you realize that a new car can depreciate extremely quickly, a used vehicle probably sounds much more attractive.

Used cars are often more expensive from the jump, meaning you’ll need a bigger loan to get one. Add in the fact that they can depreciate nearly 25 percent in one year and 60 percent after five years, and you’re looking at a not-so-smart purchase.

If you have the cash to buy it outright, go for that new car. If not, stay within your means and get something cheaper that’s used and has already taken its big depreciation hit.
<h4>4. Weddings.</h4>
While you may not enjoy that expensive Hollywood wedding, you won’t regret taking money meant for a wedding and putting it towards your first home instead.

Having to pay for a wedding you went into debt for years later can put a significant damper on that special day, so avoid the temptation to overdo it with the festivities.
<h4>5. Your children’s college education.</h4>
Your child can probably get more favorable loans for their college education than you can as a parent when it comes to interest rates and forgiveness.

Let them take out their own student loans so they can learn financial responsibility firsthand.","Debt can be a good thing if you leverage it into something that’s highly useful or can make you money later on.","2020-08-13 00:50:37",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/?p=78,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_220991617.jpg,shutterstock_220991617.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_220991617.jpg,79,shutterstock_220991617,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_220991617.jpg,"Financial Help","Recovering from hardship",draft,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,5-things-you-should-never-go-into-debt-for,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 17:53:20"
81,"How To Negotiate With Debt Collectors For Better Terms","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
You may get angry whenever you see a call or letter from a debt collector. They’re not contacting you out of any personal enjoyment they get from harassing people, however. Instead, they’re calling to resolve a debt that’s past due.

If you get a quick debt collector call because you simply forgot to make a payment, cutting a check will suffice at getting them off your back. If the past due debt is substantial and you’re extremely late, though, you may have to put your negotiation skills to work.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Your best move when it comes to collectors is to work with them to make your debt more manageable. The tips in the following list will help you not only work with them when they contact you, but also get more optimal repayment terms or stop any harassment.
<h4>1. Verify the debt.</h4>
There’s no need to negotiate if the debt isn’t even yours. Confirm that it’s yours by first asking the collector for the company’s name, their name, the phone number, and business address.

Take this step even further by getting them to send you a validation letter. They must do so within five days of contacting you. The letter must list the creditor’s name, how much you owe, and steps to take if there’s been an error.

You can get even more information on the debt by sending a verification letter within 30 days of receiving the validation letter.

Should the collection agency balk at any of the above requests, you’re probably dealing with a scammer.
<h4>2. Know your rights.</h4>
You should enter the debt negotiation process as prepared as possible. Know your rights as outlined in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA.

In short, a collector cannot use profane language, harass you, threaten to arrest or deport you, or call before 8 am or after 9 pm.

Take notes of every call, including the date, time, and collector’s name for your records. Should they violate any laws, you can report them or even sue them.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
If you want to avoid further contact for some reason and don’t wish to negotiate, write a stop contact or cease letter through certified mail. It will stop the collector from contacting you outside of saying they’ll cease contact or have plans to sue you.
<h4>3. Propose a lump sum payment.</h4>
You can settle the debt for pennies on the dollar if you offer a lump sum. This is a good option if you have some cash sitting around but not enough to pay the entire debt.

Regardless of the new payment arrangement you propose, make sure you can fulfill it. The new agreement can lead to even more issues if you fail to pay up.
<h4>4. Hint at bankruptcy.</h4>
A collector knows that bankruptcy can erase unsecured debts not tied to assets. If you mention bankruptcy, they may try extra hard to negotiate now.
<h4>5. Keep an eye on the statute of limitations.</h4>
Depending on where you live, the statute of limitations on when a debt can be collected could pass. If you make even one small payment on it, the payment clock could restart.

In short, don’t negotiate old debts whose time is about to run out. Once the statute of limitations hits, collectors won’t be able to sue you.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Consider your credit report.</h4>
Even if you pay less than the full amount, tell the collector you want all negative information related to the debt removed from your credit report. Tell them to list it as paid in full as well.

If they agree, get it in writing, along with all terms of the newly negotiated repayment. Never accept a verbal promise.

Once you have everything in writing, you can then proceed to pay according to the new terms.","As much as you may dislike their existence, you can work with debt collectors to get better debt repayment terms.

84,"3 Tips To Protect Yourself From Debt Collectors","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
What do most people do when debt collectors call or send a letter in the mail? They ignore them by rejecting the call or tossing the mail in the garbage.

While those moves may work in the short-term, they won’t make the debt nor the collector go away. And while dealing with a debt collector may be the last thing on earth you want to do, you’ll have to do it eventually before your credit gets ruined or you get sued.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

There are laws in your favor that can help you handle a debt collector properly. We’ll discuss those and some of their corresponding moves so you can make your debt more manageable while minimizing your stress.
<h3>What to Do When Debt Collectors Contact You</h3>
<h4>1. Make sure the debt in question is yours.</h4>
Just because a debt collector sounds legitimate over the phone doesn’t mean they are. To make sure they’re credible, ask for the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Collector’s name</li>
 	<li>Company’s name</li>
 	<li>Phone number</li>
 	<li>Business address</li>
</ul>
You should then ask them to verify the debt. You have every right to make this request, and they must send you a validation letter within five days. The validation letter should contain the following:
<ul>
 	<li>The creditor</li>
 	<li>The amount of debt owed</li>
 	<li>Steps to take if you believe there’s been an error</li>
</ul>
Once you receive the validation letter, you have thirty days to send a verification letter. In this letter, ask for more information on the debt.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
If the collector refuses to provide any of this information, it’s a red flag that they may be scamming you.
<h4>2. Send a cease or stop contact letter.</h4>
If the debt collector is contacting you so often that it’s affecting your life, you can write a cease or stop contact letter via certified mail.

This will not erase the debt. Instead, it will just tell the collector to stop contacting you.

In return, they can only reach you to state that they will not contact you anymore, or they are going to sue you.

Is this your best move when you have an account that hits the collections stage? Not necessarily, as you’re better off negotiating with the collectors to get better repayment terms instead.

If you simply can’t handle any more contact, though, writing a letter may give you some breathing room.
<h4>3. Know your rights.</h4>
Contrary to popular belief, a debt collector has no right to harass you. On the other hand, you have rights when it comes to contact with them. Knowing them and being informed is essential to handling collectors properly.

According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), here are things a debt collector cannot do:
<ul>
 	<li>Call before 8 am or after 9 pm.</li>
 	<li>Tell lies to get you to pay the debt.</li>
 	<li>Use profane language or harass you.</li>
 	<li>Threaten to deport or arrest you.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

If a collector does anything illegal when trying to collect the debt from you, report them to one of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Your state’s attorney general</li>
 	<li>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</li>
 	<li>Better Business Bureau</li>
</ul>
Depending on your situation, you could also sue the collector by hiring a consumer attorney.

To make your case as strong as possible, take notes of the date and time you’re contacted, as well as the collector you spoke with.","You’ll have to deal with debt collectors if you’re past due on a bill.

87,"Drowning In Debt? Here Are Several Reasons Why","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
The good news about being in debt is that you’re certainly not alone. According to a 2018 Northwestern Mutual study, the average person had debt over $38,000.

What’s the bad news about debt? The fact that you have to face it every day until you get it paid off, and this can keep you from enjoying any peace of mind.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Before you can get out of debt, you have to first figure out why you’re in it, which is what we’ll look at now:
<h4>1. You lack a budget.</h4>
If you don’t keep track of where your money goes, debt can quickly sneak up on you. That’s why it’s a good idea to track all of your spending for a month.

Once it’s over, make a budget and a plan to reduce unnecessary spending so you can pay down the debt you’ve accumulated.

You can use an app to make a budget or use a piece of paper to write down your income and expenses. The sooner you see what your money is being spent on, the sooner you can stop it to keep new debt at bay.
<h4>2. You’re an impulsive shopper.</h4>
Do you find that you’re always looking for sales, either online or in person? Are you the type of person that must buy something just because it’s discounted? If so, this can keep you in debt for a long time.

Block websites where you’re known to shop impulsively. Delete any auto-filled credit card information to make it harder to make online purchases. And if you’re always scouring the Sunday newspaper for coupons for things you don’t need, stop buying the paper altogether.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
The more barriers you create, the less likely you’ll buy things when you get that itch to spend frivolously.
<h4>3. You prioritize spending over saving.</h4>
Does most of your paycheck go towards new purchases? You’ll need to change that habit to paying your bills and debt first if you hope to escape the cycle.
<h4>4. You spend more than you make.</h4>
Living beyond your means or trying to keep up with the Joneses can put you in a deep debt hole. This is why a budget is crucial to keep track of your spending and limit it each month.
<h4>5. You link spending to emotions.</h4>
Do you engage in “retail therapy”? Does a trip to the mall temporarily cure your depression or mask other emotions? If so, this is an easy way to always be in debt.

Instead of shopping and spending when you feel sad or frustrated, try something else. Exercise or take a walk to calm those emotions, and you’ll not only feel happier, but you’ll also be in less debt.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. You pay the minimum balance every time.</h4>
Try paying off your credit card in full every month. If you can’t try to pay off each credit card purchase as you make it. This can keep your debt down and your balances low.

If you only pay the minimum amount each month, you’ll be on a never-ending debt treadmill since those payments will mostly cover interest charges and not the purchases.","Are you trying to figure out why it seems like you’re always in deep debt?

90,"7 Ways To Start Building Your Credit History From Scratch","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Everyone has to start somewhere when it comes to credit, which is why having no credit score if you’re young is no big deal.

You may have no credit score because you’ve been inactive for the past 7-10 years, though.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

If this is the case, you’ll see no rating at all when checking your free annual credit report. And while being “credit invisible” isn’t the end of the world, it can limit your opportunities to get financing when you need it.

Will building your credit history take some time? Sure. But as long as you do it correctly and make your payments on time, you should be able to have a high score and all of the perks that come with it.

With that out of the way, let’s look at the different ways you can start to build your credit history now:
<h4>1. Get a cosigner.</h4>
Do you know somebody with good credit who would be willing to cosign on a loan or credit card? If so, take advantage of that opportunity to start developing your credit.

When someone cosigns, they accept responsibility for the debt. In doing so, they give the creditor or lender some credit history to work with, which allows them to approve the application.

When taking on a cosigner, make sure you can make the payments on time. If not, they will be on the hook for your debt.
<h4>2. Become an authorized user on a card.</h4>
Just as with a cosigner, becoming an authorized user allows you to leverage someone else’s credit so you can build yours.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

As an authorized user, you will have access to the card, and its usage and payments will be reported on both your and the owner’s credit history.

As long as you can make timely payments and control your spending, this is an excellent way to start building your credit from scratch.
<h4>3. Get a secured credit card.</h4>
A small security deposit, such as $200, can help you open a secured credit card. The deposit will work as your credit limit, which means you won’t be able to make big purchases.

This may not sound ideal, but remember that the primary purpose of this move is to build credit and not necessarily use it.
<h4>4. Get a student credit card.</h4>
If you’re a student, you may be able to open a card that’s unsecured and has a low limit.
<h4>5. Get a store credit card.</h4>
Some stores make it easier to get approved for credit cards when compared to more traditional avenues. Their limits may be lower, and their fees and interest rates may be higher, however, so keep this in mind.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Factor in your utility and rent payments.</h4>
Both show evidence of responsible payment history. Unfortunately, most credit bureaus don’t report them automatically.

You can change that by contracting a company, such as Zingo, to report your utility and rent payments to the bureaus. Doing so can help build your score.
<h4>7. Buy a big-ticket item on credit.</h4>
Are you looking to buy furniture or appliances soon? See if the stores let you buy on credit and use that arrangement so you can have some credit history.","Do you have no credit score because you’ve never applied for a loan or a card?

93,"The Quickest Way To Reduce Your Internet Bill Today","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

If you have such a connection but feel like you’re paying too much for it, the quickest way to lower it is by negotiating with your current company.

What’s the benefit of staying with your current company? The fact that you can avoid a lapse in service, having to wait for installation, termination fees, or having to switch equipment.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Know what’s available.</h4>
The main goal of minimizing your Internet bill is to call your current service provider. Before you do that, however, you want to be as informed as possible and know what the competition has to offer in terms of plans and pricing.

If you think comparison shopping for affordable Internet is a time-consuming task, think again. As long as you have that handy Internet connection, you can shop by going to different company websites and seeing their plans.

Make a list or a spreadsheet of the different Internet offerings in your area. Make notes of any special promotions they have for new customers too. You want to have as much information handy as you can when making the next move.
<h4>2. Call your current Internet Service Provider (ISP).</h4>
Now that you know what’s available, you have a huge bargaining chip in your corner to lower your current Internet bill.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Call your ISP and tell them you’d like to lower your bill. Let them know that you’ve shopped around and have seen lower prices with the same levels of service elsewhere.

This may make them offer you a lower price right on the spot. If not, you can make the next move to get them to budge.
<h4>3. Threaten to cancel your Internet service.</h4>
An ISP often has procedures in place to retain customers looking to cancel. The person you’re talking to may offer you a discount to keep you on board, or they may transfer you to a retention specialist to get the job done.

When speaking to any agents on the phone, be sure to stay calm and polite. As long as they know you’re shopping around and contemplating a cancellation, there’s no need to be nasty if you want to achieve your bill-lowering goal.
<h4>4. Ask for promotions.</h4>
Your ISP may have current promotions in play that aren’t advertised. Unless you ask about them, you’ll never know they exist.

This is one of the easiest ways to lower your bill without the friction involved with threatening to cancel. A simple question could minimize what you pay for at least a few months.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Keep calling.</h4>
Just because one agent doesn’t lower your bill doesn’t mean that the next one won’t. The more persistent you are, the more likely you are to pay less.","The Internet is an absolute must nowadays due to all of the functions it can provide.

96,"Amazon.com Hacks To Get You The Most Bang For Your Buck","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Many people use Amazon.com to shop since it’s convenient and often has low prices. While it may be hard to beat Amazon in the price department, there are ways to ensure you <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/want-free-stuff-follow-these-tips/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pay even less for your purchases</a>.

Here’s a list of some of the best Amazon hacks out there:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Monitor product prices.</h4>
You may see something that seems like a deal on Amazon when it really isn’t. How can you tell? By examining its price history, which is what the CamelCamelCamel website helps you do.

While being able to see how much that product has priced for in the past is helpful, there’s another way in which CamelCamelCamel can help you save: Price alerts.

Set up a price alert, and you can see when that product’s price drops so you can pounce on it.
<h4>2. Visit the Amazon Warehouse</h4>
You can get deep discounts via the Amazon Warehouse if you don’t mind buying something that’s used, pre-owned, or comes from an open box.

Does this mean the items are in a not-so-great condition? Not necessarily, and you’ll be able to see the condition before you purchase them. It just means that they’ve probably been returned by customers, which is why you can snag them with significant savings.
<h4>3. Use Paribus to get the lowest price.</h4>
Have you ever bought something only to see it sold for less later on? That can lead to regrets, but with Paribus, you can still enjoy the latest price even after you make a purchase.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Whether via Amazon or other online stores, Paribus will scan confirmation emails to see if anything has gone on sale since you bought it. If so, it will help you get a refund that reflects the price change.
<h4>4. Let Honey find the best bargains.</h4>
Although Amazon usually offers the best prices, that’s not always the case. Some retailers may have a product for cheaper, but you’ll never know unless you comparison shop manually.

Install the Honey browser extension, however, and you can see if you’re getting the best available price. It will also apply working coupon codes to your purchase so you can save even more.
<h4>5. Get cash back on purchases.</h4>
Getting cash back when you buy something online is like getting free money. And while it may seem like a pain to enjoy such a reward, it’s super simple thanks to Rakuten.

Just shop Amazon (and other sites) like you usually do, and you can get varying amounts of cash back according to what you buy.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Get Amazon Prime for less.</h4>
If you’re a college student or receive EBT or Medicaid, you can become an Amazon Prime member for around $6 per month.

You’ll need to show proof for eligibility. Once accepted, you can benefit from Prime’s free and fast shipping, Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and other benefits that offer savings and entertainment for the entire family.","Don’t buy another thing on Amazon.com until you see these money-saving tips and tricks to make your online shopping experience more affordable.","2021-08-01 04:50:22",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/amazon-com-hacks-to-get-you-the-most-bang-for-your-buck/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1534254725.jpg,shutterstock_1534254725.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1534254725.jpg,97,shutterstock_1534254725,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1534254725.jpg,"Work From Home","Savings And Loans",publish,5,sferreira,sferreira@hardshiprecovery.com,Sam,Ferreira,amazon-com-hacks-to-get-you-the-most-bang-for-your-buck,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-10-20 13:57:55"
99,"Use These Sites To Trade, Swap, Or Barter Your Items And Services","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

The Internet makes it quick and easy to make money by selling your products or services.

For instance, if you want to sell your old clothes for cash, you can put them on Poshmark in a matter of minutes. Or, if you want to do graphic design or write for someone, you can sell those services via Fiverr quite quickly too.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Is “selling” the only way to get value in exchange for what you own or can provide? Nope, because you can now trade, swap, or barter too.

Here are some of the best sites to do just that:
<h4>Freecycle</h4>
As its name suggests, Freecycle focuses on freebies. While that’s worth a quick trip to the site in itself, you can also use it to make trades too.

Sign up and post a wanted ad, and you can describe exactly what you’re looking for and what you’re willing to trade for it.

This is an excellent option if you don’t have extra cash, but have something you can trade to acquire it.
<h4>Craigslist</h4>
It’s one of the biggest classified sites on the Net, and while you can use it to find free stuff, you can use it to barter as well.

102,"How To Find Free WiFi Within Seconds","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

If you’re tired of wasting gas as you drive all around town looking for a free WiFi signal, follow these tips to find it instead:
<h4>Find Common Places With Free Wi-Fi</h4>
The local airport, mall, hospital, library, grocery store, or hotels can sometimes have unsecured WiFi you can log on to, as can these popular locations:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Wendy’s</li>
 	<li>McDonald’s</li>
 	<li>Burger King</li>
 	<li>Taco Bell</li>
 	<li>Denny’s</li>
 	<li>Starbucks or other coffee shops</li>
 	<li>Panera</li>
 	<li>Dunkin Donuts</li>
 	<li>Barnes and Noble</li>
 	<li>Best Buy</li>
 	<li>Lowe’s</li>
</ul>
Your mileage may vary depending on your location, but those are your best bets for a no-cost Internet connection.

As a side note, remember that free WiFi doesn’t automatically mean safe surfing. Avoid checking emails or logging into your online bank accounts when using a public WiFi network to keep your data safe.

Turning on your firewall can add a layer of protection, as can turning off public sharing. And if you really want to get protected, download a VPN.
<h4>Ask Your Internet Service Provider</h4>
Xfinity by Comcast, for example, is a huge company that has free WiFi hotspots scattered all across the country. If you use them for your home Internet service, you can use their hotspots as well.

This option is reserved for people with Internet connections at home who want to enjoy free WiFi on the road. Call your provider to see if they offer this service, or look them up on the Net.
<h4>Use Facebook</h4>
Do you use the Facebook app on your phone to stay connected to your friends and family via social media? If so, you can use that same app to stay connected via free WiFi in your area.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

The app will show you the nearest hotspots you can connect to. Open it and click on the menu. Select the “See more” option and use the “Find WiFi” option to get a map of available hotspots.
<h4>Free WiFi Apps</h4>
There are tons of apps you can download that specialize in pinpointing hotspots. Even better, some will give you the actual passwords to the networks so you can connect with ease.

Here are some of the best free WiFi apps you can try:
<h5>1. Free WiFi Internet Finder</h5>
You don’t need to be tech-savvy to use this app, which makes it great for beginners.

105,"How To Minimize Your Spending In The Next 21 Days","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

What can excessive spending lead to? Loads of debt, which can lead to sleepless nights, stress, harassment from debt collectors, and even bankruptcy.

While such a scenario may seem exaggerated, it’s not for plenty of people who give in to their urge to splurge. And if you’re one of them, here is how to keep such a situation at bay by doing a 21-day financial fast.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How to Do a 21-Day Financial Fast</h4>
Just like a dieting fast where you don’t eat, you won’t spend for 21 days during this financial fast. But if you think you’ll be starving or stuck on the street from not buying food or paying your rent, don’t worry, as it allows for necessities.

Impulse purchases on things you don’t need can take up a significant portion of your expenses. In fact, they may make up the majority of your costs and could be the most significant risk to your financial future.

By sticking to necessities for 21 days, you can avoid impulse purchases altogether to keep more money in your pocket.

While luxuries like eating out, going to the salon, or shopping for clothes you don’t need are out of the picture for 21 days, here’s another way to control your spending: Sticking to cash.

Think of the difference in how you feel when buying something with a credit card versus cash. When you use a card, you probably don’t feel much pain or separation since the transaction is quick and doesn’t touch your bank account.

When you pay with cash, however, you have to count it out. You have to take it out of your wallet and hand it over. And once the cashier has it, that cash is gone for good.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

This feeling of loss and separation can act as a deterrent to keep you from spending on non-essentials. By sticking to it during your 21-day financial fast, you can realize that paying with cash is the way to go.

It’s important to remember that this exercise is 21 days. Don’t cut its length to a week or two weeks to make it more convenient. Doing so will minimize its benefits and won’t make any changes to your spending lifestyle.
<h4>Tips to Make Your Financial Fast Successful</h4>
To ensure you finish the fast and reap its rewards, write down your expenses, thoughts, and feelings in a journal so you can read them later on.

If possible, get an accountability partner to do the fast with you. They can offer support and motivate you to finish.

Before you begin, make a list of needs and wants. Don’t be too lenient when making a list and place a ton of luxuries under your needs section, either. It’s meant to be a challenge that cuts unnecessary spending, so categorizing correctly is crucial.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Lastly, eliminate any temptations. For example, if you love to shop online, delete your credit card information from any auto-fill programs that make it easy to make purchases with one click. Or if you love window shopping at the mall, don’t go.","Imagine having more control over your spending in the next 21 days.

108,"7 Tips To Avoid Or Lower Potential Student Loan Debt","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

The student loan crisis has gotten so bad that some feel the only way to fix it is via debt forgiveness. While the chances of that happening are probably slim, you can avoid this issue by making these moves to either avoid student loan debt altogether or minimize how much you’ll need:
<h4>1. Work.</h4>
Having a job before and during college can help pay your tuition so you can skip debt or take out smaller student loans.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Does this mean you’ll need a full-time job to cover your costs? No, it just means you should make the most of your free time to stay debt-free once you graduate.

<a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/how-students-can-make-money-from-home-during-these-tough-times/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Get a part-time job</a> or work during your summer breaks. Every little bit helps.

Open a savings account specifically for your school expenses. This can keep your cash stashed in a safe place while earning interest.
<h4>2. Get college credits before hitting the university campus.</h4>
If you’re in high school, you should take as many advanced placement courses as possible. Some offer college credits that can reduce how many classes you’ll need to pay for.
<h4>3. Search for scholarships.</h4>
You may get scholarships for a high GPA or your extracurricular accomplishments that can reduce the cost of college. But even if you have neither of those on your resume, you could still snag some free college cash.

Do a Google search for scholarships. Speak to your high school guidance counselor if you haven’t graduated yet. Or, if already in college, talk to your financial aid officer to see what resources are available.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

The more work you do here, the less work you’ll have to do at a job, and the fewer loans you’ll have to take out to finance your degree.
<h4>4. Pick a college you can afford.</h4>
If your dream school is way too expensive, you may want to explore more affordable options.

You could go to a community college and then transfer to your dream school, which makes your beginning years more affordable.

You could also opt for a public state school versus a private one that’s out of state and more expensive.
<h4>5. Choose federal student loans.</h4>
While a federal loan will put you in debt, it’s much better than a private student loan in terms of flexibility, affordability (lower interest rates), and forgivability.

For instance, if you can’t get a job once you graduate, a federal loan could be more lenient in terms of repayment. A private loan, however, may not be so easy to work with.
<h4>6. Stick to cash.</h4>
It’s easy to get into debt during college by using credit cards, especially if you’ve never used them before. Avoid the temptation by using cash instead, as you don’t want to start your financial career in a credit hole.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Cut your costs.</h4>
Avoid eating out during college and stick to a school meal plan or the more affordable grocery store instead. Buy used textbooks or share them with your classmates. Do clothing swaps with friends or get free clothes online or cheap ones at the thrift store.

All of these moves will reduce your costs so you can stay as debt-free as possible.","You don’t want to dedicate most of your post-graduation paycheck to paying down student loan debt, which is why you should follow these tips now.","2021-08-01 04:15:44",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/7-tips-to-avoid-or-lower-potential-student-loan-debt/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_704891500.jpg,shutterstock_704891500.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_704891500.jpg,109,shutterstock_704891500,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_704891500.jpg,"Benefits Assistance",,publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,7-tips-to-avoid-or-lower-potential-student-loan-debt,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-18 04:08:16"
112,"Ask Yourself These 5 Questions Before Refinancing Your Mortgage","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

You can thank the coronavirus for the record low mortgage rates that were just put into play. While many people are taking advantage of them to refinance their mortgages and save money every month, there are some questions you should answer before doing the same.
<h4>1. Will I be living in my current house much longer?</h4>
Mortgages usually aren’t short-term loans. They’re often paid back over several years or even decades. And most of your initial mortgage payments will go towards paying down the interest and not the principal.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

In addition, refinancing a mortgage often comes with fees that can cost thousands of dollars. Although you can save on your monthly mortgage payment, you want to ensure that those savings cover any costs associated with the new loan.

In short, if you aren’t planning on staying in your home for at least five years, you may be better off sticking with your current loan.

If you refinance it and move shortly after, you won’t be able to enjoy any of the monthly savings that can keep more money in your pocket in the long run.
<h4>2. Is my application likely to get approved?</h4>
If you know that you’re currently saddled with debt, have missed a lot of payments, and your credit score has plummeted recently, the chances of your refinance application getting approved are small.

LendingTree found that approximately 25 percent of refi applications get denied, and this can be linked mostly to high debt-to-income ratios and poor credit.

Before you take the leap to refinance your mortgage, try to clean up your financial situation so you don’t end up wasting your time. A couple of tips to achieve this goal are to:
<ol>
 	<li>Check your free annual credit report for any errors and report them.</li>
 	<li>Pay down any non-mortgage debts.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>3. Can I avoid mortgage insurance?</h4>
If you have a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan or put less than 20 percent down on your home, you’ll have to pay mortgage insurance. This can take a chunk out of your budget every month, and it’s an expense you want to avoid.

If you’ve reached the point where you have 20 percent equity in your home, a refinance can make sense since you can skip out on mortgage insurance.
<h4>4. How much can I save?</h4>
You don’t want to refinance your mortgage if it will end up costing you more money, or the savings will be insignificant. To avoid this, try to follow the rule which states that your new interest rate should be 50 basis points lower than the old one.

How can you find the lowest rate possible to satisfy that rule? Shop around with several lenders instead of simply paying attention to average rates posted by Freddie Mac.

Shopping around also lets you see which lenders offer the most savings when it comes to closing costs. Combine this information with the new, lowest rate you can find, and you can see how much you’ll save and whether or not refinancing is worth it.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Can my current lender beat it?</h4>
You may not have to use a new lender to refinance your loan, which could make it a much easier process since they already have all of your information. Let them know you’re shopping around, and they’ll likely do their best to give you a great deal.

By getting the savings you want and simplifying the process, answering this one question could make refinancing your mortgage a no-brainer.","Extremely low interest rates make this an attractive time to refinance your mortgage. Before you do so, here are five questions you should ask yourself to help make that decision.","2020-08-13 01:00:34",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/ask-yourself-these-5-questions-before-refinancing-your-mortgage/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_151907384.jpg,shutterstock_151907384.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_151907384.jpg,113,shutterstock_151907384,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_151907384.jpg,Housing,"FHA Assistance",publish,4,mpatrice,mpatrice@hardshiprecovery.com,Maria,Patrice,ask-yourself-these-5-questions-before-refinancing-your-mortgage,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-11 20:22:08"
115,"Lower Your Monthly Mortgage Payment With These Simple Refinance Tips","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>Don’t Cash Out</h4>
Some people like to use some of their home equity as part of a new loan via a cash-out refinance. While you could put that cash to use, it will increase the loan-to-value ratio of your mortgage, which could increase your interest rate.
<h4>The Shorter the Loan, the Better</h4>
Don’t let lower monthly payments with longer loan terms fool you into a higher interest rate. If you can afford to pay more each month, a shorter refinance mortgage can net you a lower interest rate, which can lead to spending less over the loan’s life.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Talk to as Many Lenders as You Can</h4>
Make the most of your refinancing journey by shopping around with as many lenders as possible. Even if the first lender you speak to has a great offer, don’t accept it until you’ve seen what its competitors’ numbers are.

Freddie Mac analyzed the benefits of comparison shopping and found the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Comparing two lenders saved consumers an average of $1,500 over the life of the mortgage.</li>
 	<li>Comparing five lenders led to $3,000 average savings.</li>
</ul>
As you can see, it pays to take your time and see what’s out there. And this is especially true now with record low interest rates.
<h4>Make Your Credit Score as High as Possible</h4>
Is your credit score so low that you haven’t checked your credit report in a long time out of fear? If so, you’ll have to get over that fear and see where you stand so you can create a plan to make your score more attractive to lenders.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

You can begin this process by getting your free credit report. Once you have it, scan it up and down and look for any errors. The more mistakes you find and get removed, the higher your score will be, and the lower the refinance interest rate you can secure.

Removing errors from your credit report is just one way to boost your score. Another is to increase your available credit by giving your creditors a quick call.

Why would you want to do this? It’s not so you can instantly start spending more. Instead, it’s to lower your credit utilization ratio, which makes up a big chunk of your credit score.

Although you could also pay down your debts to lower your ratio, that’s not always a quick option if you’re low on cash, which is why calling and raising your limits may be your best bet.

While a lower credit utilization ratio (aim to keep it below 25 percent) can improve your score, this doesn’t mean you should put a freeze on your spending.

To keep your score increasing, spend smaller amounts on credit so you can pay them off monthly. Doing so makes you appear like a trustworthy borrower and a lower risk to lenders.

The less risk you present, the lower interest you can pay on your new mortgage.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Lock Your Rate</h4>
Once you find an interest rate that you like, ask your loan advisor about a mortgage rate lock. It can keep your rate from rising while the loan is being processed.

Since it could take two weeks for your loan to be finalized, a lock will give you peace of mind to know you’re getting the lowest rate even if they’re increasing.

When you consider that current rates are so low, doing a mortgage rate lock now makes more sense than ever.","Want to refinance your mortgage so you can take advantage of some of the lowest interest rates in years?

118,"How To Get The Lowest Interest Rate When Refinancing Your Home","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>Quick Tips to Boost Your Credit Score</h4>
The higher your credit score, the more likely you’ll get a lower interest rate on your new mortgage.

Here are some of the simplest ways you can raise your score as you look to jump into this perfect refinancing opportunity:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h5>1. See where you stand.</h5>
It’ll be hard to improve your credit blindly, which is why you should first get your free annual credit report so you can see where you currently stand.

If your score seems way too low at the moment to get approved, you may want to hold off just a bit on refinancing until it improves. And you can improve it by making some of the following moves.
<h5>2. Check for errors.</h5>
Credit report errors pop up much more often than you’d think, which is why you should scan your report to see if there are any that need to be removed.

The quicker you can remove the errors, the faster you can see your score increase. This makes a refinance application’s approval and getting a lower interest rate more likely.
<h5>3. Use less of your available credit.</h5>
Are all of your credit cards maxed out? If so, having such a high credit utilization ratio can keep your score lower than you’d like. And this can keep you from getting that low interest rate you desire.

Do your best to pay down debt so you can lower your utilization ratio. If this isn’t really an option, you can also try to increase your available credit by contacting your credit card companies.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h5>4. Make small credit purchases and pay on time.</h5>
You want to show that you’re good at managing your debt. Doing so can increase your score and lead to a more favorable refinance loan.

How can you show you’re a good debt manager? By making small credit purchases and paying them off every month.
<h4>Other Tips For Getting The Best Refinance Rates</h4>
Now that you know what can help you increase your credit score, let’s look at some other methods for getting low refi rates.
<h5>Compare as Many Lenders as Possible</h5>
The mortgage marketplace is competitive. What does this mean for you? That lenders are going to try to outdo the competition in order to secure you as a customer.

Shop around with as many lenders as you can. On average, Freddie Mac says you can save $3,000 during the life of a mortgage by shopping among five lenders. If you shop just two, those savings drop to $1,500 over the life of the loan.

What should you focus on when comparison shopping for the best refinance loan? Keep an eye on the annual percentage rate (APR). Instead of just showcasing the interest rate you’ll pay, it also includes any extra fees.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h5>Opt for a Shorter Term</h5>
If you have some wiggle room in your budget, aim for a mortgage with fewer years on the loan. Shorter loans can lead to lower interest rates and save you a lot of money over time.","Has the news of super-low interest rates tempted you to refinance your home?

<h4>Do Online Tutoring</h4>
Non-essential businesses aren’t the only places that have closed due to COVID-19, as schools have done the same. Does this mean that students of all grade levels have stopped the learning process completely? No, as many have moved their studies online.

Like healthcare, grocery stores, and deliveries, tutoring is still very much a need right now. You can help fill it by becoming an online tutor to put what you’ve learned in your studies out there as a marketable and profitable skill.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While you could ask friends and family if they have any tutoring needs for their children, a quicker way to get clients is by joining several online tutoring programs or websites, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Brainfuse</li>
 	<li>Chegg</li>
 	<li>Skooli</li>
 	<li>Tutor.com</li>
 	<li>TutorMe</li>
 	<li>Yup</li>
</ul>
Each site’s requirements will differ, with some requiring degrees or experience. If you’re not accepted by one place, keep looking, as there are many out there. All it takes is one to start boosting your income from the comfort of your couch.

With pay ranging from $9 to $25 per hour, who knows? You may find this newfound money-making opportunity to be more profitable than any previous job you had before COVID-19 hit. Even better, becoming an online tutor can give you the independence that a regular job cannot.

If you don’t find academic tutoring topics to be up your alley, you can still teach others what you know and get paid for it via Symposium. Sell live, online classes where you teach others to cook or exercise, for example, and you can earn a pretty penny.

Pick a skill that you’re good at, create a profile, and start selling it to others online via sites like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer.

Not only can this come in handy when you don’t have many options for work, but it can lead to a lucrative career in the future by being your own boss.
<h4>Participate in Clinical Trials</h4>
This may not lead to steady, weekly income, but there are occasional clinical trials with hefty payouts that are also quite interesting to be a part of.

You can find clinical trials through sites like the government’s Clinical Trials database or Just Another Lab Rat.
<h4>Turn Textbooks Into Profit</h4>
What’s one of the most significant expenses for students? Textbooks, and unfortunately, they’re a necessary one too.

<h4>How SNAP Works</h4>
The United States Department of Agriculture runs SNAP. It was developed to give low-income families a helping hand when it comes to putting food on the table, and should you qualify, it can help you do the same.

Unlike food stamps in the past, those who qualify for SNAP will get an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card to use at specific farmers' markets and grocery stores. Such stores often have signs that say “We accept SNAP benefits,” and you can use your card in these locales similar to a debit card.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

By transferring benefits to your card every month, SNAP can give you more wiggle room in your budget for other expenses while covering the necessity of proper nutrition.
<h4>SNAP Financial Requirements</h4>
To determine if you’re eligible for SNAP benefits, two main things will be considered: Your resources and income. Requirements may vary from state to state.

Resources in SNAP’s eyes include any checking or savings accounts, while some states consider having more than one car as a resource. On the other hand, the following are not resources when SNAP eligibility is being determined:
<ul>
 	<li>Your home.</li>
 	<li>The resources of people receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).</li>
</ul>
Each state has its own resource limits. To find yours, contact your local office by clicking here.

In terms of income, SNAP looks at both gross and net income. Your gross income equals total income derived from sources like:
<ul>
 	<li>Work wages</li>
 	<li>Disability payments</li>
 	<li>Pensions</li>
 	<li>Veterans’ benefits</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Net income, meanwhile, is how much income is left after certain deductions, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Utility costs</li>
 	<li>Child support payments</li>
 	<li>Dependent or child care payments</li>
 	<li>Monthly medical expenses exceeding $35 for disabled people or anyone over 60</li>
</ul>

There are limits for both gross and net income. Gross income limits vary by state, which you can discover by contacting your local office.

Net income limits, regardless of state, must sit below 100 percent of the federal poverty level. This comes out to roughly $2,000 a month for a household with four people.

To be eligible for SNAP, most households must meet both the gross and net income limits. Exceptions include households with disabled members or people over 60, which would not have to meet the gross income limit, and households where everyone is receiving SSI or TANF benefits.
<h4>SNAP Non-Financial Requirements</h4>
Some people may not be eligible for SNAP, even if they meet the income requirements, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Undocumented immigrants</li>
 	<li>Anyone convicted of a drug-related felonyCo</li>
 	<li>llege students (there may be exceptions)</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>SNAP Work Requirements</h4>
Your local office may have its own work requirements to be eligible for SNAP. Here are some of the standard requirements you may see:
<ul>
 	<li>Must register for work</li>
 	<li>Must not voluntarily quit work</li>
 	<li>Must take a job if offered</li>
 	<li>If assigned, must participate in a training and employment program</li>
</ul>
Non-disabled adults without children may have to pass other work requirements as well.
<h4>Applying for SNAP</h4>
If you feel that you may be eligible for SNAP and would like to receive benefits, contact your state agency directly. You may be able to apply online, depending on location.","If you’re finding it hard to buy groceries due to a lack of income, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can help.

ave you lost income due to all of the coronavirus shutdowns? Or even worse, have you lost your job entirely?

In either case, your need for shelter doesn’t diminish. But how can you find a safe, affordable home if your income is low or you fear that temporary government assistance will soon run out?

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

One option is to become a Habitat for Humanity homeowner. And while they don’t give away homes for free, they can help you find a safe, efficient, and affordable home for a fraction of the cost while building your pride and confidence in the process.
<h3>The Advantages of Habitat Homes During Tough Times</h3>
<h4>Affordability</h4>
Paying high rent when money tight is a huge problem that many people are facing right now. Even though evictions may have been put on hold, that won’t last forever, which has many wondering what they’ll do for housing once landlords start demanding past payments.

Habitat for Humanity homes offer affordability in many ways. Their mortgage payments are often lower than average, and so are their monthly bills.

Why are Habitat homes’ bills lower than similar homes in the area? You can attribute that to the fact that they are built with efficiency and cost-effectiveness in mind, so expenses like utilities won’t spiral out of control.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Stability</h4>
By having a home you can afford through Habitat for Humanity, you don’t have to worry about constantly moving and renting from different landlords. This can help with maintaining steady employment and keeping your kids in the same schools.

Such stability is reflected through actual statistics from Habitat for Humanity that have shown the following life-changing benefits:

Children from Habitat homes go to college at a higher rate than others with similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
Habitat homeowners have a track record of gaining financial independence thanks to the program’s classes and educational resources provided during the process of acquiring a home.

<h4>Community</h4>
Through its “sweat equity” requirement where you help local volunteers build homes to qualify for housing, Habitat for Humanity builds a sense of support and community that can play a big part in accelerating your financial recovery.

Even if you don’t participate in constructing a Habitat home, taking educational classes on homeownership or performing administrative work to complete the sweat equity requirement will put you in touch with many helpful and knowledgeable members of the community.

This is one of Habitat’s most significant benefits, and it’s one that cannot be measured in dollars.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Safety</h4>
Whether it’s due to the negative impact of COVID-19 or some other disaster, you may feel unsafe and vulnerable, which can make it even harder to get your finances in order.

If you’re living in a Habitat home, however, you’ll be in a safe community that can give you the peace of mind you need to move forward.","Has the COVID-19 pandemic damaged your finances to the point that you’re looking at a full recovery to get back on your feet?

131,"Do This To Make A Home Office More Productive","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Whether your employer instituted telecommuting in response to a global pandemic or you simply decided to take your talents online, your home office is where the magic happens. Working from home has its advantages, but it can also present issues that could affect your productivity.

Here are some tips to make your home office as productive as possible:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Pretend Like You’re Going to an Actual Office</h4>
It’s tempting to lounge around all day in your pajamas, but something as simple as a too-relaxing wardrobe can negatively impact your productivity.

Many experts suggest that even if you’re working remotely, you act as if you’re going into the office. This means eating breakfast, taking a shower, and also getting dressed to work in your home office.

By doing all of the above and doing it at the same time every day, you can subconsciously trick yourself into being more productive at home instead of slacking.
<h4>Set Boundaries With People</h4>
The distractions that come with telecommuting can be endless. And while your TV or favorite Internet sites can throw you off track, people can be much worse.

Whether it’s your partner, kids, roommate, or nosy neighbor, set rules about interacting with them during work hours. Let them know that you’ve shifted to a home office and that you’d appreciate it if they limited interactions to outside of your work schedule.
<h4>Eliminate Any Clutter</h4>
Living, breathing distractions can make it tough to get tasks done, but so can inanimate ones. For this reason, it’s a must to declutter your workspace or even your entire home so you can stay focused.

If you have a specific space where you’ll be working, dedicate it to work and nothing else. In other words, put any toys, electronics, or extra boxes elsewhere.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Pick the Right Space</h4>
Do you share a common wall with a noisy neighbor? Setting up your office near that wall could lead to disaster in the future.

When picking your home office, select the most tranquil, distraction-free, and inspiring spot as possible. It’s best to make this decision now before you run into any problems later on.

<h4>Add Peaceful Elements</h4>
Plants can create a feeling of comfort and relaxation, as can fountains.

Do you need white noise to function? Buy a white noise machine that plays different relaxing and distraction-killing sounds to make you more productive.

Whatever the knickknack or addition, pick it up and put it in your home office if you feel it will help.
<h4>Add Useful Elements</h4>
It may take a bit more of an investment, but don’t skimp on essentials like a comfortable and ergonomic office chair or a solid desk that’s big enough to house all of your needs.

Other useful elements could include noise-canceling headphones or an anti-glare screen for your computer.
<h4>Add Exercise Equipment</h4>
You don’t need a full home gym, but some type of exercise equipment, like free weights or a treadmill is great to get the blood flowing during breaks.

As much as you’d like to, sitting in your chair for long periods without getting up and stretching, moving around, or exercising isn’t good for your health or productivity.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Stay Organized</h4>
A daily to-do list written on paper or an organizational app can help you get more done. As you complete tasks, mark them off your list to get a feeling of accomplishment and get a guide of what to do next.","Have you shifted to remote work?

134,"7 Tips To Increase Home Office Productivity","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

If working from home is a new thing for you, it probably occurred as you decided to work for yourself via the Internet or your employer made the pandemic-related push towards telecommuting. Either way, you’ll want to make the most of your home office so you can be as productive as possible.

The following tips will help you achieve that goal:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Be selective.</h4>
Your home office should be chosen strategically. This is especially true if you live in an apartment with shared walls or on a street where there is a lot of noise.

If you know certain areas of your home are louder than others, do not consider them for your office space. Each dwelling usually has that one spot that’s more peaceful and less distracting than others. Choose that as your office, and go from there.
<h4>2. Declutter everything.</h4>
With that perfect spot picked out, start decluttering your home office space, and, if you can, do the same for your entire house.

Clutter can be quite distracting and can make you lose your focus, which is an absolute must to have when working from home.
<h4>3. Invest in necessities.</h4>
A comfortable office chair is worth its weight in gold, especially if you’re going to be seated most of the time while you’re working. When choosing one, you may be better off doing so in person instead of ordering online so you can get an authentic feel of its comfort.

A sufficient-sized desk is another necessity, as are any drawers for organization so you can avoid clutter and visual “noise.”
<h4>4. Don’t forget the peaceful touches.</h4>
A beautiful view can help you relax and be more productive, but so can certain products you can buy at the store or online.

For example, if you need quiet to focus, noise-canceling headphones or a white noise machine can help you achieve that tranquility, even if you live in a noisy area.

You can also add things like mini fountains or soft lighting to help you concentrate and perform at your peak.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>5. Get your blood flowing.</h4>
You don’t have to be a workout warrior, but having some exercise equipment nearby can get the blood flowing through your body and brain to boost productivity.

Free weights, a mini treadmill, elastic bands, and the like can all come in handy during your frequent breaks.
<h4>6. Keep human distractions at bay.</h4>
This can be tough to do if your kids, partner, or roommate at home, but you’ll have to set strict boundaries in your schedule for social interaction. If you don’t, you’ll get distracted and lose focus quickly, which makes it impossible to work properly.

Let your friends, loved ones, and neighbors know the best times to contact you. Otherwise, limit any interactions during work hours to emergencies only.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Act as if.</h4>
Act as if you’re going to the office every day.

You wouldn’t start the workday without showering or getting dressed, would you? Of course not, which is why you should pretend you’re heading out every day so you can put yourself in that focused and professional mindset.

If you don’t think this will make much of a difference, try it one day versus working on the couch in your pajamas. You should notice an improvement.","Working from home is a move many have made lately.

137,"4 Ways To Make Money From Home If You’re Retired","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Besides a few “essential” workers, most of us have been stuck at home for the last few months. While this may have been a tough pill to swallow, it’s been the perfect time to start making money from home.

Of course, this brings up the issue of how to earn money from home if you’ve never done it before. And if you’re retired and not too tech-savvy, you may be wondering if such work is right for you.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

The good news is that you can start earning an income via the Internet, regardless of experience. And you don’t have to be a tech genius to do it, either.

Simply follow these tips and start searching around, and you could turn your home into a money-making machine in no time.
<h4>1. Turn extra space into cash.</h4>
Whether you live alone or are sitting on a ton of room in your house since your kids left, you can turn that extra space into income by renting it out online.

There’s no shortage of people looking for storage space or even parking spots, and they may be willing to give you money to use yours.

Neighbor is a site that lets you rent out unused space to store your neighbor’s belongings. Visit their website now, and you can find out how much your space is worth per year.

If you don’t think you have enough space worth renting, check first, as these are just some of the ways to make money via Neighbor:
<ul>
 	<li>Basement</li>
 	<li>Closet</li>
 	<li>Garage</li>
 	<li>RV pad</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Share your knowledge for a fee.</h4>
You can turn your experience in a particular field or even basic knowledge into income by becoming an online tutor or creating a virtual class.

Some tutors/teachers can make as much as $25 per hour to guide others on everything from academic topics to inside info on the process of signing up for Social Security.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

If you have the patience and love to teach, this is a great way to pad your income through sites like:
<ul>
 	<li>Varsity Tutors</li>
 	<li>Udemy</li>
 	<li>Skillshare</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Get paid as an online consultant.</h4>
If you have very specialized experience that you’ve racked up over the years in a specific field, you can make a pretty penny by becoming a freelancer or consultant online.

Clients of all sizes can be found on sites like Guru, Fiverr, and Upwork seeking legal advice, marketing advice, and more. Create your profile today, and you could have your first paying contract very soon.

The more clients you get, the more you can start charging as your online reputation builds. Best of all, you can do this according to your schedule on a part-time basis while still living the relaxed retiree lifestyle.
<h4>4. Do remote work.</h4>
Are you good with people? Do you like talking on the phone or chatting online? If so, you can turn those skills into remote work as a customer service representative.

If you’re great at organizing, you can become a virtual assistant and perform everyday tasks for someone halfway across the world for a fee. Or, if you’re great at typing, you can become a transcriptionist and use that to supplement your fixed income.

Is a new laptop a worthy investment? If you look at all of these purposes it can serve, the answer to that is yes:
<ul>
 	<li>Functions as an office on the go.</li>
 	<li>Ideal for distance learning.</li>

 	<li>Acts as a virtual encyclopedia where you can find information on almost anything you can think of.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Now that there are no doubts about whether or not a reliable laptop is worthy of your attention, let’s look at where to find one that fits your needs.
<h4>The Best Places to Buy a Laptop</h4>
Buying a laptop online is incredibly quick and convenient. It can also make it very easy to comparison shop so you can find the best deal. However, if you don’t have much experience with laptops, you may be best served to visit some retailers in person to perform a test drive before you buy.

After picking out a brand and model of laptop, head over to a place like Best Buy or Walmart to see how they feel, look, and function in the flesh. Both retailers have robust sales on laptops, and, at the very least, they let you narrow down your choices to find the right fit.

If you already know what you want and are ready to buy online, you can’t go wrong with places like Amazon, NewEgg, TigerDirect, Overstock, and eBay. The sites make it easy to find the ideal laptop according to your price point, desired brand, specifications you seek, and more. You can also look for refurbished deals.

Most importantly, these sites let you see reviews so you can see what other consumers think of that potential purchase. By reading these reviews, you can make a more informed choice to ensure your money is well spent.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>When to Find the Best Laptop Deals</h4>
Due to the convenience of the Internet, loads of competition, or some other combination of factors, it seems like laptop deals can be had year-round.

This is excellent news if you don’t want to plan ahead and need a new laptop now. If you can wait, though, here are the hottest times of the year for the biggest laptop discounts:
<h5>Near Huge Product Launches</h5>
If you don’t need the latest, greatest laptop, you can use this in your favor to snag significant savings. How? By buying your laptop around major product launches.

Whether it’s right before or right after launch, you can get the laptop you need at a deep discount since the newer release will garner all of the attention.

Manufacturers will often drop the price of “older” laptops around new releases so they can still move their products. As for when these launches tend to occur, Apple’s often come in September, while Microsoft usually likes to hold its epic events in October.
<h5>When It’s Back-To-School Time</h5>
There are great deals on laptops during the back-to-school season, which is around June through September. The last week of July and the four weeks after are quite good for finding laptop deals.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h5>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h5>
Either of these popular dates is great for buying a new laptop, with Cyber Monday being a bit better in terms of deals.","A new laptop could launch a remote work career, help you distance learn, or become a new entertainment hub in your home.

You cut unnecessary items, such as dining out and your Netflix subscription, to stretch your budget, or you could get aid from the government. One area where the government offers help with paying bills is with cooling and heating costs, and LIHEAP is how it does it.
<h4>How LIHEAP Helps With Energy Bills</h4>
You may dread getting your energy bill each month, especially during the summer and winter. Why? Because those are the times of the year where your AC or furnace tends to work overtime, and that can result in higher bills that are harder to pay.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

With LIHEAP, you can reduce your cooling and heating costs via financial help from the government instead of having to suffer with your AC or furnace turned off or turned down to uncomfortable levels.

Does LIHEAP pay your entire energy bill? No, as it's solely intended to take care of things related to cooling and heating. As such, here are some specific ways LIHEAP can help your bottom line:
<ul>
 	<li>Paying the cooling and heating portions of your energy bills.</li>
 	<li>Aiding with utility shut offs and other emergencies.</li>
 	<li>Making home improvements to increase energy efficiency through a process called “weatherization.”</li>

Although weatherization may not be available through every LIHEAP office, it can be extremely beneficial if you can get it. For instance, you can use weatherization to install insulation or improved sealing to keep cool or warm air from entering or escaping your house. You may be able to get your AC or furnace repaired or replaced as well. All of the above can lead to lower energy costs in the future.
<h4>How to Apply for LIHEAP</h4>
As you can see, LIHEAP can make a significant difference with your energy costs now and into the future. Since the program’s funding is limited, you’ll want to apply as quickly as you can to get in line for benefits before they run out. Here’s how to do so:
<ol>
 	<li>Contact your nearest LIHEAP office. When contacting your office, be sure to ask about requirements, as they differ from state to state. To qualify, you will likely have to meet specific income requirements.</li>
 	<li>Since LIHEAP isn’t the only way to get help with your energy bill, ask if the office can direct you towards any other programs via local charities or utility companies.</li>
 	<li>If you cannot reach anyone at your local office, contact your state’s LIHEAP office.</li>
</ol>

hat are two necessities when it comes to caring for your baby? Diapers and wipes, and if you’ve had a baby before, you know they can be quite costly.

While the functions wipes and diapers perform may be necessary, they can be replaced. To see how, let’s look at cloth and its cost-cutting benefits.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Cloth Diapers Versus Disposable Diapers</h4>
Before we jump into how you can use cloth diapers to save cash, let’s see if they’re even worth it by comparing prices:
<ul>
 	<li>Disposable diaper = around $0.25 per use</li>
 	<li>Cloth diaper = around $0.07 per use</li>
 	<li>$0.18 savings * 7 diapers per day = $1.26 savings per day</li>
 	<li>$1.26 savings per day * 365 days = $459.90 savings per year via cloth</li>
</ul>
As you can see, you can stack some significant savings by switching to cloth diapers. Now let’s look at what your next move should be before investing in some.
<h4>Tips for Buying Cloth Diapers</h4>
There is a wide variety of cloth diapers to suit differing needs. Research the different styles to see which fits your baby best.

How can you save as you try different styles? Buy used cloth diapers as a test. Local consignment shops may have some, and browsing Facebook garage sale groups in your area could yield a few too.

The benefit of locally shopping for used cloth diapers is that you get to see and feel them in person. Ordering online may be quicker and more convenient, but as with shopping for clothes, it can be difficult to decipher that perfect fit.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Caring for Cloth Diapers</h4>
Instead of tossing them in the trash and watching your dollars go down the drain, you’ll be saving your cloth diapers for multiple uses. As such, you’ll need to employ a solid cleaning routine to keep them fresh and in tip-top condition.

New cloth diapers should be prepped for use. Used ones should be bleached before putting them on your baby for the first time.

To extend the life of your cloth diapers, look for solid cleaning tips online that detail which detergent to use, the ideal washing temperature, and so on. The longer the diapers last, the more savings you and your baby will be able to enjoy.
<h4>Use Cloth Wipes</h4>
Baby wipes perform another necessary childcare function that can pack a wallop on your wallet. Luckily, cloth can save the day here too.

You don’t need to buy cloth wipes. Look around your home, and you should find plenty of viable options in for form of hand towels or old T-shirts you can cut up into wipes.

Before washing the wipes, spray them with a cleansing solution, rinse them, and throw them in a wet bag. This will make less of a mess if you wash them with other clothes.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Make Your Own Baby Wipes</h4>
If cloth wipes don’t seem like a viable option, you can make your own wipes to save on the expensive store-bought variety.

Paper towels will work at a fraction of the cost, as long as you treat them with certain ingredients. A quick online search will show you how to make your wipes with ease using items in your home.","Raising a newborn as a single parent can be financially frustrating.

149,"Do This To Hit Your Student Loan Debt Head-On In 2020","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

at’s the one thing that’s harder than getting a job straight out of college? Paying off student loan debt when you can barely make ends meet.

Even if your income isn’t where you want it to be, you can still start minimizing that college debt so you can start saving for your first home and other financial goals.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

The key is organization, and the following steps will help you achieve just that.
<h3>How to Start Lowering Your Student Loan Debt in 2020</h3>
<h4>1. Get a clearer picture of where you stand.</h4>
Do you have a ballpark figure of how much you owe? Do you know that you have multiple loans, but barely know the creditors’ names? If so, you need to take the first step towards tackling student loan debt, which is to create a spreadsheet.

In the spreadsheet, you want to include every detail of your outstanding loans to see precisely where you stand. Include how much is owed, what the interest rates are, the monthly due dates, and the contact information for each loan servicer.

Do you have any loans that are in forbearance or deferment? Note that in the spreadsheet as well, plus any repayment dates.

A little time spent entering data could save you a considerable headache from missing payments. And by seeing what you owe and when it must be paid, you can create an attack plan that makes sense.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>2. Set up automatic payments.</h4>
Auto-pay can keep you from putting off your student loan payments if you get the urge to spend on something else. They can also help if you happen to forget about a payment, which could negatively affect your credit.

What happens if you forget too many payments? Your student loan could go into default. If that happens, the government can start dipping into your paycheck or tax refund until its federal loans are fully paid.

Want another reason to set up auto-pay? It could save you money, as some student loan servicers will offer interest rate reductions if automatic payments are enabled.
<h4>3. Ensure your repayment plan suits your needs.</h4>
If you’re still searching for a job or aren’t making enough income, it may be time to consider restructuring your repayment plan.

Don’t be shy when it comes to reviewing your repayment options. A simple call to your student loan servicer could open your eyes as to what’s out there.

When speaking to your servicer, tell them every detail about your current financial situation. If you’re having trouble keeping up with payments, let them know so they can steer you in the right direction.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

In the end, the servicer wants to ensure you can pay back the loan. To make this happen, they will likely be willing to work with you until both parties are happy.

If you have several student loans, give consolidation a look. It can simplify repayment and allow you to keep a bit more in your pocket, although you may be paying for a bit longer.","Are you tired of having loads of student loan debt hovering over your head?

152,"How To See New Movies Before Anyone Else Does – For Free","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

ne of the best ways to find more money in your monthly budget is to cut entertainment expenses. This means going out to eat less and not going to the movies as much.

The average movie ticket costs over $9. Add in guests and refreshments, and it’s easy to see why avoiding the movies can keep a lot more money in your pocket.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While you could wait for movies to be released on DVD or Netflix to enjoy them for cheaper, there’s another way to do the same. In fact, it even costs nothing to see movies this way, and you can see them before anybody else does.

What’s the secret? Signing up for advance movie screenings. Why would a theater let you see a not-yet-released movie for free? So that the movie studio can build up buzz before it hits the cinema.

You don’t need to be a famous movie reviewer or work for a major network to get in on advanced screenings. You just need to connect with the following free ticket sources and wait for your opportunity.

Before we jump into the list, keep in mind that you may need to live near a big city to take part in these freebies. Also, only select films have advanced screenings, so don’t expect free tickets for every single release.
<h3>Where to Find Free Movie Tickets for New Releases</h3>
<h4>1. AdvanceScreenings.</h4>
This website lets you search by the new movie’s name, or your city and zip code. It also lets you know when the screenings became available, which is essential since tickets are on a first-come, first-served basis.

If you see a movie you like in a city near you, click on it and follow the links to grab your complimentary passes. And if you see that all the passes are already taken, don’t give up. Some studios release extra passes later on, or people may cancel their reservations.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>2. Gofobo.</h4>
All you have to do here is enter your zip code to find advance screenings near you. As a bonus, you can also use the site to enter sweepstakes that could give you additional chances to win free movie tickets.
<h4>3. Fandango.</h4>
This popular movie website allows you to view upcoming screenings in major cities across the U.S. As with other sites on this list, you can enter your email to get updates when new free movie ticket opportunities arise.
<h4>4. Lionsgate.</h4>
If you love past films from this studio, you’ll want to visit their site to see when new screenings are about to hit.
<h4>5. Sony.</h4>
Like Lionsgate, Sony Pictures lets you check when it’s planning to have advance movie screenings in your area.
<h4>6. Warner Bros.</h4>
Movie giant Warner Bros. sometimes showcases its films via screenings before they become available to the general public. Go to their site to see if any screenings are coming to a city near you.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Tips for Getting Free Movie Tickets to Advance Screenings</h3>
As mentioned, screenings are limited to certain cities and to those who claim their tickets first. To increase your chances of seeing an unreleased film for free, sign up to the mailing lists of all the sites above.

Another way to get free movie tickets is through your local newspapers, radio stations, or TV stations. If you do get a screening pass, be sure to show up early to get a seat and bring your ID.","Do you want to know how to see new movies before they hit the theaters?

155,"Should You Freeze Your Credit To Combat Identity Theft?","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

The long list of massive data breaches from companies like Capital One, Equifax, and Marriot may have you worried about your identity being stolen and your credit being protected.

One way to protect yourself from such issues is to freeze your credit. To find out if this move is right for you, let’s look at when you should set up a credit freeze, how it can affect you, what it costs, and more.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is a credit freeze?</h4>
A credit freeze is a move that essentially locks down your credit report and makes it inaccessible to anyone but you.

Before a new credit account can be opened, a creditor, bank , or credit card company will need your permission to do so. And since your credit report won’t be viewable, they won’t issue that credit, which helps if your data is in the hands of a scammer.
<h4>How much does a credit freeze cost?</h4>
Before 2018, a credit freeze could cost you anywhere from $5 to $15. There would also be an additional charge each time you wanted to unfreeze it.

Now, however, you can freeze and unfreeze your credit at no cost.
<h4>How do you freeze your credit?</h4>
Freezing your credit takes a bit of work since you’ll be dealing with three credit bureaus. Each has its own process for freezing credit, and you’ll have to contact them to initiate the process.

While you could mail the credit bureaus to set up a freeze, it’s a slower option than calling or doing it online.

Here is the contact info you’ll need to kickstart the process:
<ul>
 	<li>Equifax – Go here or call 800-685-1111.</li>
 	<li>Experian – Go here or call 888-397-3742.</li>
 	<li>TransUnion – Go here or call 888-909-8872.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How long does it take for a credit freeze to start?</h4>
Make the request by mail, which is not recommended due to speed, and you’ll have to wait three business days.

Do it online or via phone, however, and you can expect your freeze to activate within one business day.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>When should you freeze your credit?</h4>
You’ll obviously need to freeze it once you realize you’ve been a victim of identity theft. You can also freeze it to protect your child’s credit.

If you’ve been a victim of a data breach or think you’ve had your identity stolen, you should freeze your credit as well. But to truly play it safe, the best time to request a credit freeze is right now.

Sure, you’ll have to do some extra work during the setup and when you want to unfreeze it, but that added peace of mind is well worth it.
<h4>How do you unfreeze your credit?</h4>
You’ll need to lift the freeze when you want to open a new credit product. You can either do this temporarily to have it activated once you’re done, or have it stay unfrozen for convenience.

Visit each credit bureau’s website to unfreeze your credit. The process should be completed within an hour since federal law requires it.
<h4>The Pros and Cons of Freezing Credit</h4>
The pros of freezing your credit are that it:
<ul>
 	<li>Is free.</li>
 	<li>Won’t affect your credit score.</li>
 	<li>Can keep scammers from opening new accounts in your name.</li>
</ul>
The cons are that credit freezes:

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<ul>
 	<li>Require extra work to set up with the different credit bureaus.</li>
 	<li>Will need to be lifted when you want to apply for new credit.</li>
 	<li>Do not protect accounts that you currently have.</li>
</ul>
With that being said, it’s now up to you to initiate a credit freeze or not depending on your situation.","When should you set up a credit freeze? How can it protect you from identity theft?

Your wallet may not be the only thing that’s empty thanks to COVID-19, as your refrigerator may be looking pretty bare as well.

If there’s a food shortage in your house, don’t feel bad, as many families are going through the same thing after losing jobs and income. If you need evidence of this, turn on the news or look for any stories about food distribution sites. You’re likely to see lines of cars that are quite long.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While getting food stamps may seem like the best way to fight a food emergency, what happens if you’re hungry right now? What if you don’t have the time to fill out an application and wait to get approved for a government food assistance program? What’s your best option then?

The answer is to call the USDA National Hunger Hotline, as it was created to help connect people with food when times get tough. It’s a great option if you don’t know what to do to feed your loved ones. The hotline also takes care of any awkward feelings you may have about reaching out to friends, family, or neighbors for food assistance.
<h4>How to Get Help From the USDA National Hunger Hotline</h4>
It’s surprisingly easy to get help from this hotline. And since COVID-19 has caused so much economic devastation, you certainly won’t be the first person to call it. In other words, don’t feel ashamed about needing help. It’s quite common right now.

To contact the hotline and get emergency food assistance, call 1-866-3-HUNGRY. You can also call 1-877-8-HAMBRE if you need help in Spanish. Be sure to note the hotline’s operating hours, which are 7 am to 10 pm Monday through Friday.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

While calling is the most direct way to get the food help you need now, you can also text the hotline 9779 with a food-related question. To ensure that you receive an automated response about food assistance resources in your area, include a keyword in your question such as “meals” or “food.”

Again, it’s essential not to be fearful about calling the hotline. Even if you’ve never been in this situation before, what’s most critical is that you get food on the table, so your family stays fed.

If you’re not a citizen, it does not matter. Nor does it matter why you require food. The hotline’s representatives won’t discriminate and are there to help. Since food resources may be limited, especially due to COVID-19, the sooner you call, the better.
<h4>Services Offered by the National Hunger Hotline</h4>
Since you probably need food assistance now and not later, a representative should give you immediate options, such as soup kitchens, food distribution sites, or helpful religious or community organizations in your area.

If food shortages are a recurring theme that you feel may extend past COVID-19, ask the representative about other options, such as:

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<ul>
 	<li>SNAP</li>
 	<li>WIC</li>
 	<li>Free school meals</li>
 	<li>Summer food services</li>
 	<li>Food assistance programs for seniors</li>
</ul>
There are a wide variety of food assistance programs out there, so you’ll likely find one to fit your needs now and into the future.","Don’t let COVID-19 cause an empty kitchen.

161,"5 Steps To Get Housing Subsidies for Seniors","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Overpaying for rent can make life tough for the elderly, as it leaves less money for other expenses and emergencies. With the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program, you won’t have to worry about overpaying for rent, as the government will chip in to help you with the bill.

How much will the government chip in? Since you’ll only have to pay 30 percent of your income towards the rent, the answer is a lot.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s needed to get an affordable Section 202 apartment? Just follow these steps:
<h4>1. Figure out if you’re eligible.</h4>
You can do a quick prescreen of yourself to see if Section 202 would be a good fit. If the following apply to your situation, you may be the perfect applicant:
<ul>
 	<li>You or someone in the household is at least 62.</li>
 	<li>The household’s combined income (not including what anyone under 18 makes) is less than 50 percent of the area median income where you plan on living.</li>
 	<li>You already receive another type of assistance from the government (this is not always required for eligibility).</li>
 	<li>You don’t have any felony convictions for violent or drug-related crimes.</li>
 	<li>You don’t have an outstanding debt with a housing authority.</li>
 	<li>You haven’t had housing assistance terminated in the past.</li>
 	<li>You haven’t been evicted from a HUD property within the previous five years.</li>
</ul>
Again, that’s just a prescreen to give you an idea of what Section 202 looks for in an applicant. Don’t let anything in that list automatically disqualify you without contacting your local housing agency first.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>2. Find a Section 202 apartment that fits your needs.</h4>
Section 202 apartments and seniors go hand in hand. Beyond the savings the program provides, some of its properties have features and services that many seniors need.

For example, you can enjoy daily activities, plus transportation services. There may be coordinators on-site to assist with care and things like bathing and meals. Some apartments may also feature ramps and grab rails to make senior life easier.

You may have already come across a Section 202 apartment by word of mouth. If not, you can do an online search for Section 202 communities or apartments in the location you desire. Another option is to contact your housing agency to see if they can point you in the right direction.
<h4>3. Apply for Section 202.</h4>
Once you’ve found a property you like, you’ll have to apply through the landlord or management company that runs it. An application fee may be necessary, unlike Section 8 and other housing programs.

After you complete your application, expect to wait at least a couple of weeks to get an answer. Your wait time may be longer.
<h4>4. Wait for approval.</h4>
You may be placed on a waiting list before you can move into the Section 202 property. There’s quite a demand for this program, so your wait could last months or even years. This is why you may want to look to areas with a lower population to see if you can reduce your wait time. Ask the landlord or management company for an estimate, and keep in contact with them after applying.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Complete the interview.</h4>
Once a unit opens up, you’ll need to complete an in-person interview to confirm that you are eligible for Section 202 housing assistance. If you are officially approved, you can move into your new apartment and start enjoying life without the worries of high rent.","If you want an apartment that’s cheap, safe, and senior-friendly, follow the steps in this quick guide.","2021-06-28 22:30:26",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/5-steps-to-get-housing-subsidies-for-seniors/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1613773825.jpg,shutterstock_1613773825.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1613773825.jpg,162,shutterstock_1613773825,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1613773825.jpg,Resources,"Rental Assistance",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,5-steps-to-get-housing-subsidies-for-seniors,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:55:00"

The Internet makes it much easier to find the information you need, but one thing that may be hard to find is affordable housing.

<h4>1. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h4>
You probably know that this government program exists, but under a more commonly used name of “food stamps.” It was created to help those who are having trouble feeding their families, which describes a lot of us now more than ever.

Getting SNAP involves passing specific requirements. Luckily, many of them have been eased during the COVID-19 pandemic to make food assistance more accessible.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

How is SNAP now easier to get? Instead of having to go in person to enroll, you can complete a remote application. You may get more money towards groceries than previously possible.

Also, if you have kids, you can get school meals without having to bring them along for the ride. This keeps them safer from the outbreak and reduces the spread of the coronavirus.

Visit the official SNAP page to learn more about this form of food assistance.
<h4>2. The National Hunger Hotline</h4>
You can call the USDA National Hunger hotline to get emergency food assistance by dialing 866-3-HUNGRY between 7 am and 10 pm Eastern. The hotline functions from Monday through Friday.
<h4>3. USA.gov Website</h4>
If you’re interested in seeing the various ways in which the government can help you during these tough times, a trip to the USA.gov website can help you achieve that goal.

Of particular help will be its food assistance page. Have a closer look at it and bookmark the page for the future, as it has several options that can help your family in the future should money issues arise, and you find your cupboard getting bare.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>4. Social Services</h4>
Each state has a social services agency that can help families during times of need. Go here and select your state or territory from the drop-down menu. On the next page, look for the Social Services option and click on it.

Depending on what your state has to offer, you could see links for food assistance, as well as help with jobs, child care, and much more.
<h4>5. Organizations Within Your Community</h4>
The nutritional help you need may be a lot closer than you think. Getting in touch with a religious or community organization can help you find food and a whole lot more.

You could do an online search for religious or community organizations in your area. You could also use the 211 service for more direct help.

As you can see at that link, 211 has a section devoted to COVID-19 resources. You may find food assistance there, as well as help with other necessities.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. The News</h4>
If you haven’t been watching the news or checking local websites, you may want to start. Since food scarcity and loss of income is such an issue, food distribution drives are continually being announced.

As soon as you see a distribution site announcement, do not delay in showing up. Many have seen long lines, as the number of families who are struggling grows.","Are you stressing over keeping your family fed during the COVID-19 pandemic?

You may have heard of Section 8 in the past, and you are probably aware that the government program provides housing assistance. You may have never seen a Section 8 property, however, and you may be wondering what it’s like.

With the HUD Resource Locator, you can find affordable housing opportunities that participate in Section 8 near you. Best of all, you don’t have to leave the comfort of your couch to do it.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The HUD Resource Locator</h4>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is in charge of the Section 8 or Housing Choice Voucher Program. As such, it created the HUD Resource Locator to give users a one-stop-shop for affordable housing information.

Here’s a glimpse into how this handy housing tool works.
<h4>How to Use the HUD Resource Locator to Find Section 8 Housing</h4>
To start searching for Section 8 properties, visit the HUD Resource Locator by going here. At first, a map of the U.S. will pop up. Then you’ll see the main menu appear.

The main menu offers a variety of resources on housing. For this article, we’ll focus on the first one, which is “Find Affordable Housing Opportunities Near Me.”

Once you click on that option, you’ll see a map of your current location. The site uses Garmin GPS coordinates for this feature, so you can start searching for Section 8 properties without even having to enter an address.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Depending on where you currently are, you may see several icons on the map. Each represents a different type of housing or resource related to the HUD. For instance, you may see Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). These are what you’ll use to apply for Section 8 housing. They can also help you learn more about the Housing Choice Voucher program and direct you to other resources for putting a roof over your head.

On your map, you may also see Assisted Multifamily Properties. Click on their icon, and you’ll find out more about the property. For instance, it could be a property that’s for low income (Section 8), elderly, and special needs. You’ll see more info about the property, such as its address and contact info so you can learn more.

You can also view how many affordable units are in the property and their layout. For example, one property could contain several efficiencies, and 1-bedroom units. Another may house only 5-bedroom units. This information is crucial, as it can give you a better idea of whether or not that property fits your family’s needs.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Beneath the property breakdown, you’ll also see a description of the programs that pertain to it. If it’s Section 202, that’s like Section 8, but for seniors. If it’s subsidized housing, that pertains more to the Section 8 program, where you pay 30 percent of your income towards rent and utilities.

If you don’t want to live where you’re currently located, enter your desired location at the top of the tool to see what’s available there. Once you see the possibilities, contact your PHA to get started with your application for subsidized housing.",,"2021-06-28 22:45:36",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/can-this-tool-help-you-find-section-8-subsidized-housing/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1330195403.jpg,shutterstock_1330195403.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1330195403.jpg,171,shutterstock_1330195403,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1330195403.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,4,mpatrice,mpatrice@hardshiprecovery.com,Maria,Patrice,can-this-tool-help-you-find-section-8-subsidized-housing,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-09-20 15:31:47"

When your income is low, or you run into financial trouble, two main worries come to mind. First, you wonder how you’ll pay the rent so you can stay off the streets. And second, you wonder how you’ll pay for food, so your family doesn’t starve.

While there are ways to get housing assistance from the government, we won’t focus on that today. Instead, we’ll look at how the government can give you food assistance from one handy website.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Getting Food Help From the Government via USA.gov</h4>
The last thing you want to do when your family is hungry is run all over the place looking for food. Time is of the essence, and you want to find the help you need as quickly and as efficiently as possible.

What’s the best way to do that? By merely going here and visiting the Food Assistance page on USA.gov. The fact that this page hosts so many food assistance resources is excellent. What’s even better, though, is that it’s an official site of the U.S. government, so you can use it without worries about being scammed.
<h4>USA.gov Food-Related Features</h4>
USA.gov offers everything under the sun, including affordable housing, financial aid for students, help with bills, unemployment assistance, grants and loans, and more. As far as its food assistance features, here’s the rundown:
<h4>Help If You Need Food Right Now</h4>
All of your food worries may be solved by making a quick call to the National Hunger Hotline. It functions in English by calling 866-3-HUNGRY and in Spanish by calling 877-8-HAMBRE. Call between 7 am and 10 pm Monday through Friday, and you can find out where food assistance exists near you.

The operator may let you know of any local food drives that are currently active. They may also tell you of churches or community organizations offering free food to those who need it.

Will calling the hotline be a long-term solution for your food needs? Probably not, as you likely want something more stable, such as these next options.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>SNAP</h4>
If you’re tired of having a minimal budget for food, SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could be of big help.

More commonly referred to as food stamps, SNAP gives most participants funds on a card. Visit a grocery store that accepts SNAP benefits, and you can swipe the card to pay for qualifying items. The more family members you have, the more benefits you can receive.
<h4>WIC</h4>
If you’re pregnant right now or recently have a child, WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children can supplement your nutrition. WIC will give you the funding you need to buy items that recent mothers and children need, such as formula, milk, and more.
<h4>School Programs</h4>
Kids can get food assistance through USA.gov in a variety of ways beyond SNAP and WIC. Here are some of the more popular ones:
<ul>
 	<li>The School Breakfast Program</li>
 	<li>The National School Lunch Program</li>
 	<li>The Summer Food Service Program</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Senior Programs</h4>
Seniors can receive food assistance as well via these two programs:
<ul>
 	<li>Commodity Supplemental Food Program</li>
 	<li>Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program</li>
</ul>

Some help came via the federal government and it’s CARES Act, which helped people get $1,200 stimulus checks and $600 weekly unemployment benefits for a specified period. What about food assistance, though? What if you need help securing food, so your family doesn’t suffer? Here are various ways to get that help now.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. What’s the best way to get emergency food assistance?</h4>
If you can’t go another day without food, you’ll need emergency assistance. It may be temporary, but it can keep your family from starving until you get things figured out financially.

You have several options when it comes to emergency food assistance. First, you can call 211 to speak to an operator that can tell you where to find food near you. Second, you can call the National Hunger Hotline between Monday and Friday during the hours of 7 am to 10 pm to get similar assistance. The hotline’s number is 866-3-HUNGRY.

While those are direct ways of finding emergency food assistance, you may get lucky by keeping tabs on your local news. Many food drives are popping up daily, and they use the news to broadcast their time and location. Should you see an announcement about a food drive or distribution site, don’t wait to go. Lines are often long, so you want to secure your spot to ensure you get food before it’s too late.

The Internet has several resources for emergency food assistance as well. There are directories where you can find food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and similar forms of assistance very quickly.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

For instance, Feeding America has over 60,000 food pantries and 200 food banks in its directory. All you have to do is go to this page and enter your zip code to see what’s available. From there, you can contact each resource to see what’s needed to get food today.
<h4>2. How can food stamps help during the pandemic?</h4>
Food stamps, or SNAP benefits can give you some much-needed stability when it comes to nutrition. Should you qualify, you can get a certain amount of money loaded to a card each month that you can use to purchase groceries.

By having SNAP benefits, you won’t have to worry as much about food during the pandemic. This will make it easier for you to get on your feet and concentrate on other things.

To see if you can qualify for SNAP, go here. It’s worth noting that getting SNAP is a bit easier now, as they relaxed some requirements due to COVID-19.

212,"Homelessness And Housing: Trump vs. Biden","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

It didn’t take COVID-19 to cause an epic rise in homelessness, as ever-increasing rents had many finding themselves on the streets before the pandemic ever took place. However, the coronavirus certainly didn’t help as it caused millions to lose their jobs as businesses shuttered to stop the spread of the disease. With that loss of employment and income came the reality of eviction and foreclosure for many.

It may not take the spotlight over other topics that dominate the headlines daily, but affordable housing and homelessness are significant issues for many voters. Here are where both presidential candidates stand.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Donald Trump</h4>
President Trump’s most significant housing action involved repealing the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. It was put into place by President Obama as a way to enforce the 1960s Fair Housing Act. Under the law, communities would be required to construct affordable housing units in neighborhoods to address racial segregation.

Regarding the move, Trump tweeted in July that people living in the suburbs would no longer have to worry about low-income housing moving into their neighborhoods. He added that repealing the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule would help keep home values up and crime down.

Last year, Trump pledged to tackle homelessness in California by ridding the streets of encampments and offering shelter in government facilities, although that never happened. He did approve increases in grants for federal homeless assistance, however.

A White House spokesperson also stated that Trump aimed to make the construction of low-cost housing easier by getting rid of regulatory obstacles. In 2017, he approved a tax cut that incentivized developers to construct “opportunity zones” in low-income communities. So far, it looks like some of the tax breaks were used to build luxury housing.

As for how he’d address affordable housing and homelessness in his second term, Trump’s campaign website does not offer any proposals at this time.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Joe Biden</h4>
If he is elected, Trump’s opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, has pledged to reinstate the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s popular Section 8 program would also garner increased Biden administration attention.

Biden’s housing plan would include more Section 8 subsidies to make rent more affordable for low-income families. An investment of $5 billion would be put towards a tax credit to ensure Section 8 families pay a maximum of 30 percent of their income towards rent.

Low-income housing would be upgraded via a $100 billion fund. Developers would be incentivized to construct affordable housing through $10 billion in tax credits. Localities that end construction restrictions close to public transit centers could also receive federal grants.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

In terms of homelessness, Biden promised $13 billion in funding to help people get off the streets. This isn’t limited to those who are currently homeless, either. He offered criminal justice plans to secure housing for inmates as soon as they leave prison and help them get on their feet and readjust to society.","How do Donald Trump and Joe Biden compare when it comes to the topics of homelessness and affordable housing?

That’s according to studies that have analyzed how common lost money is.

Why is there so much unclaimed property sitting around? Because many people don’t know such a thing exists. And if they do know it exists, they don’t know how to find it. There’s no need to wonder whether you have lost money waiting to be claimed anymore, as you can make the following moves to end that mystery once and for all.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Tips to Find Lost Money From Bank Accounts, Insurance Policies, Investments, and More</h4>
Before we get into how to start looking for unclaimed property, let’s quickly discuss what it is. Sometimes the government, a business, or a person can owe you money.

If they have problems contacting you, that money can go unclaimed after a specific time. To reverse this, someone will first have to search and see if they have any unclaimed property. Then they will have to take steps to show it’s theirs and claim it.

With that out of the way, let’s look at some places where you can start searching for lost money:
<h4>1. States</h4>
States often take control over unclaimed property, such as old bank accounts or life insurance policies. That’s why many people turn to state websites first to see if they have any lost money waiting to be claimed.

If you’ve moved around in the past, it’s best to search every state you’ve lived or have done business in. You can search multiple states at once by using a free national site like Missing Money. You can also search each state one by one by going <a href=""https://unclaimed.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.

Regardless of which path you take, try searching for common misspellings of your name and any nicknames. You can also do searches for family members.

<h4>2. IRS</h4>
Are you wondering what happened to a past tax refund? There may have been an error mailing it to you. Go here to check its status, as this is a common form of unclaimed money that many people overlook.
<h4>3. Banks and Credit Unions</h4>
When financial institutions fail, people sometimes forget they have funds sitting in their accounts. You can go <a href=""https://closedbanks.fdic.gov/funds/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> to see if you have any unclaimed money from bank accounts or go <a href=""https://www.ncua.gov/support-services/unclaimed-deposits"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> to see the same for credit unions.
<h4>4. Investments</h4>
Harmed investors may be owed money from a company in some instances where enforcement was required. You can search for this form of unclaimed property <a href=""https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/claims.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.

<h4>1. Keep an eye on your local news stations.</h4>
Food drives can appear from time to time in your city. How do they get the word out so people can arrive and get the help they need? Usually via local news stations that let the public know where to go.

Does this mean you have to have your TV tuned to the news to see if any new food drives pop up? Of course not, as you can also buy the newspaper, go to the news station’s website, or visit their Facebook page for alerts.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Visit the government’s main assistance website.</h4>
While you’ll want to bookmark your local news station’s website and Facebook page to see if any food drives appear, here’s another site worth keeping tabs on: The USA.gov food assistance page. It’s the federal government’s official page on the subject, and it’s loaded with resources to keep you floating above water when it comes to nutrition.

Whether you need immediate food aid, food stamps, nutrition for women and young children, or food assistance for seniors and school lunches, you can find it all on this page.
<h4>3. Call the National Hunger Hotline.</h4>
Food assistance is just a phone call away with the National Hunger Hotline. The USDA is behind this helpful hotline that can give you nutritional help when you most need it.

Call 866-3-HUNGRY on Monday through Friday between 7 am and 10 pm Eastern, and you can get info in English or Spanish on food resources such as food drives, soup kitchens, and more.

If you prefer to communicate via text, you can do so by texting 9779 to the hotline with a question related to food. As long as you include a keyword like “food” or “meals” in your text, you will get an automated response to guide you.

<h4>4. Get in touch with your state’s social services.</h4>
Families in need can turn to social services in their state for help with a variety of issues well beyond just food. For instance, if you need help with childcare or employment, you could get it by simply contacting your state’s social services program.

To find yours, <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">go here</a> and pick your state or territory from the menu.

<h4>5. Find help in your community.</h4>
Community and religious organizations often play a huge role in feeding families when they’re hungry.

There are two main ways to find such organizations that offer food assistance. First, you can search for community or religious organizations in your city. Second, you could dial 211 to speak to an operator that can point you in the right direction for food.

If you need other forms of assistance, don’t hesitate to ask when talking to an organization or 211. Doing so will help you kill several birds with one stone.
<h4>6. Get food assistance from SNAP and WIC.</h4>
Two popular food assistance programs from the government are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC. SNAP is more for families in general, while WIC helps pregnant women and very young children.

3400,"How To Find An Apartment With A Felony On Your Record","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

There’s no need to feel down if you need to find an apartment and have a felony on your record. Even though your options may be more limited, they do exist. And thanks to the Internet, you can start finding those options rather quickly.
<h4>How to Find Apartments That Accept Felons</h4>
To make your apartment search as fruitful as possible, you must think of the best path to bypassing a background check. It’s that check, after all, that can reveal a felony and cause a landlord or management company to reject your application.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Besides finding a place in the area you need that also fits your budget, finding one that doesn’t require a background check should be your number one goal. Here are some tips that may help you bypass that part of the application process:
<h4>1. Be flexible with location.</h4>
Can living in the middle of a city make it easier to commute to work? Of course, it can, but city living can also make it harder to find a felon-friendly apartment.

You can blame much of this on demand. Many people need to live in big cities for work and convenience, and this increased demand gives landlords and management companies more power to be selective.

If you can live farther away from the city, you can find properties where demand is low. With that lower demand often comes fewer restrictions and a higher probability of finding a place despite having a felony in your past.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Another benefit besides bypassing background checks and demanding landlords is that smaller towns are often more affordable. This can be a huge plus if you’re just starting to get your life together, and every penny counts.

On the flip side, you don’t want to move too far away from work. The need for a car or other transportation costs could take a big bite out of your budget.
<h4>2. Look for specific types of properties.</h4>
Demand for certain types of housing is higher than others. For instance, you may have an easier time finding a place as a felon by renting out a single room or a basement as opposed to an entire apartment.

Remember this when searching websites for felon-friendly properties. Some may give you the option to look for shared housing and rooms, in addition to entire apartments.

While you may find a felon-friendly apartment, it’s best to avoid properties listed in huge buildings, as they tend to be run by strict management companies that seek solid credit along with background checks from prospective tenants.
<h4>3. Deal with private landlords.</h4>
If the site you’re using lets you pick properties according to who runs them, always aim for landlords instead of management companies.
You’re much likelier to find leniency there.
<h4>4. Don’t waste your time.</h4>
If an application says they require background checks, don’t fill it out. Read the fine print so you don’t waste your time applying to places that probably won’t accept you. Instead, dedicate your time to places like basements, single rooms, and properties run by private landlords that are usually more flexible in their ways.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Know where to look.</h4>
Here are some of the best places to begin your search for a felon-friendly property:
<ul>
 	<li>Craigslist</li>
 	<li>Trovit</li>
 	<li>Zumper</li>
 	<li>Yelp</li>
 	<li>Zillow</li>
</ul>
The ones near the top of the list are usually more felon-friendly. You can narrow down results by searching for phrases such as “no background check” and “felon-friendly.”","Finding an apartment as a felon is far more possible than you think. Here are some handy hacks to make it happen while searching for properties online.","2020-08-26 17:00:14",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/how-to-find-an-apartment-with-a-felony-on-your-record/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_564131902.jpg,shutterstock_564131902.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_564131902.jpg,3470,shutterstock_564131902,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_564131902.jpg,Resources,,publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,how-to-find-an-apartment-with-a-felony-on-your-record,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:55:06"

If you never needed food assistance before because you were always able to keep your kitchen stocked, you may be wondering where to look once supplies become scarce. Could you call up family for some extra cash to buy groceries? Sure. What about heading over to your neighbor’s house to see if they can help with your emergency? That could work too.
Unfortunately, those are very temporary fixes, and food is a permanent need. What are better ways to find food assistance besides friends, family, and neighbors? Have a look at this list.
[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>SNAP Food Stamps</h4>
Even if you never used them, you probably have an idea of what food stamps are and how they work. They aren’t really “stamps” anymore, however, as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides most beneficiaries with debit-like cards that can be swiped at participating grocery stores.
The good thing about food stamps is the stability they can provide. By knowing you have a certain amount per month to buy groceries with, you can feel better about your family’s nutrition.
To learn more about SNAP and how food stamps work, visit the program’s official site.
<h4>WIC Food Assistance</h4>
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, is another popular food assistance program. It allows you to buy nutritional essentials at the store that are especially helpful for pregnant women, newborns, and very young children.
Like SNAP, WIC is ideal since it offers stability in the way of food. Once you apply for WIC and get approved, you can get peace of mind knowing you’ll have some of your nutritional needs met.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>Local Help</h4>
SNAP and WIC are great resources for food assistance, but you may not have to go far to find that help. Many cities have food drives, distribution sites, pantries, and more that can give you temporary aid with stocking your kitchen.
There are several ways to find such nutritional help nearby. First, you can do an Internet search for food drives in your city. You can do the same for religious and community organizations in your area that often play a huge role in keeping families fed.
For more direct help, dial 211 on your phone. Doing so will put you in touch with an operator that will let you know which food assistance options are in your area.
After you dial 211, you can take things a step further by dialing 866-3-HUNGRY. It’s the number for the National Hunger Hotline, and it can also give your resources to help combat hunger in the form of soup kitchens, food drives, local organizations, and more. Be sure to dial the hotline on Monday through Friday between 7 am and 10 pm to get assistance.
[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->
Lastly, turn to your local news for information on food distribution sites. They will often broadcast new info via TV, the newspaper, or their website/Facebook page.","You can’t stay hungry for long if you have a family to feed, which is why it’s great to know that there are several sources of food assistance at your disposal.

If you’ve never gone hungry in the past, think of this scenario: You lose your job and run out of cash. All of your credit cards are maxed out. Before you know it, you no longer have any food in your fridge.
It’s not a pleasant thought, but it’s a reality for many families. And if you ever got to the point where you no longer had food in your home, you’d have to call somebody for help.
[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->
Could a family member, friend, or neighbor help you out? Probably, but it’s likely they have issues of their own. And whatever help they did give you, could be very temporary.
What’s another option besides asking for help from people you know? Call a hotline that was created by the United States Department of Agriculture specifically for such situations.
<h4>The USDA National Hunger Hotline</h4>
Should you ever need emergency food assistance, you can thank the USDA National Hunger Clearinghouse for this hotline. Within seconds of dialing 866-3-HUNGRY on your phone, you can connect with a representative who has expertise in finding food for families in need.
The hotline functions in Spanish as well by calling 877-8-HAMBRE. Both lines function between 7 am and 10 pm, Monday through Friday.
If you don’t want to call the hotline for some reason, you can text them instead. Text 97779 to the number with your food-related question. Provided your query contains a keyword like “meals” or “food,” you’ll get an automated response that can offer the food assistance info you need.
Unlike applying for SNAP food stamps or WIC benefits, the National Hunger Hotline offers nutritional help regardless of why you’re hungry. In other words, you don’t necessarily have to pass an income test or a lengthy application process to get food.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
When you call the hotline, they won’t care why you are having issues buying food. Maybe you just lost your job. Perhaps you had a family emergency that put your finances in a bid. Or maybe you mismanaged your funds and now find yourself in a pickle.
No matter the reason, the representative you speak with can connect you with some form of short-term food relief before starvation enters the picture.
While the reason you lack food doesn’t matter when calling the National Hunger Hotline, neither does your citizenship status. Just call, and you can get the help you need.
As for what types of food assistance are available, that will depend on your location. Generally, you can find short-term nutrition solutions such as soup kitchens. There may also be food pantries in your area, or churches and other organizations that help people with this issue.
[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->
If you find that you are always having issues with the affordability of food, it may be useful to apply for a longer-term solution, such as SNAP or WIC.

3420,"The 3 Best Places To Start Looking For College Grants","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
The excitement of graduating from college and starting your professional career can only be ruined by one thing: Student debt. Depending on how much debt you accumulate, you could find yourself paying a considerable portion of your newly acquired salary just to pay it off. This can add stress to your life and put you in a financial bind for years until everything is finally paid off.
Should student loans that put you in debt be avoided at all costs? Not necessarily, as they can prevent you from putting your college dream on hold while financing your education. You should try to find other forms of funding, however, to limit your debt. And one of the best ways to do this is by getting college grants.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>The Primary Benefit of College Grants</h3>
A student loan can give you the cash you need to pay for tuition and other education-related expenses right now. You’ll have to pay that money back, however. Even if you get a great interest rate, the thought of owing money is never nice, which is why getting free money via grants is even better.
Yes, a grant is free money because it does not have to be paid back. Isn’t a scholarship the same? Somewhat, with the main difference being that scholarships can be harder to get since many are linked to merit-based qualifications.
So, if you want a scholarship to help bring down college costs, you may need an impressive resume that lists:
<ul>
 	<li>High test scores</li>
 	<li>Excellent grades</li>
 	<li>Extracurricular achievements</li>
</ul>
The scholarship may even factor in need amongst applicants. A grant, on the other hand, usually focuses on need instead of merit. In short, the list of qualifications is often a lot shorter, making grants more attainable.
<h3>The Three Top College Grant Resources</h3>
If you started searching for student loans and scholarships, reading the above has probably motivated you to shift that search towards college grants. Where should you begin? Here are the three top spots:
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>1. The Federal Government</h4>
You can begin your grant search by aiming for the biggest source of free college money, which is the federal government. You can get Pell Grants, Academic Competitiveness Grants, and more by merely completing your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form and seeing if you qualify.
What this does is gives colleges a glimpse into whether or not you truly need financial aid. Since most grants are based on need, determining yours then gives colleges the green light to send you information on what you can qualify for.
Once your FAFSA application is finished, keep your eyes peeled for those college letters. Each one could be filled with free money in the form of grants. The quicker you respond, the better your chances of getting complimentary, debt-free funding before other students with similar needs.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>2. The State</h4>
With FAFSA and the federal government finished, you can turn to your state next to see what grants it has to offer. You can do this by selecting your state <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and contacting your local agency.
<h4>3. The College</h4>
Are the federal government and states the only sources of college grants? Of course not, as your college may have some too. Give your university’s financial aid office a call and let them know you’re looking for grants.","Where can you find free money for college? The answer is to find grants, and here are the three best places for tracking them down.","2020-09-21 18:56:55",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/the-3-best-places-to-start-looking-for-college-grants/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_703779841.jpg,shutterstock_703779841.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_703779841.jpg,3464,shutterstock_703779841,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_703779841.jpg,"Financial Help",Education,publish,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,the-3-best-places-to-start-looking-for-college-grants,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-11 20:16:34"
3423,"How To Get An Emergency Section 8 Voucher As A Felon","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
A Housing Choice Voucher from the Section 8 program is highly sought-after government assistance. Why are housing vouchers so popular? Because getting one means that you only have to pay between 30 and 40 percent of your adjusted gross income towards rent and utilities. That leaves a big chunk of your income that can be used for other purposes.
As a felon, such assistance is ideal for helping you reintegrate into society. It provides savings, and more importantly, stability since Section 8 housing isn’t just affordable, it’s safe and decent.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Felons and Section 8 Eligibility</h4>
A convicted felon can qualify for a Housing Choice Voucher. However, some circumstances can prevent approval, such as being convicted of a sexual or violent crime, drug trafficking, or having a felony that’s less than five years old. Your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA) will tell you if your felony can prevent you from qualifying, so don’t hesitate to ask.
If your felony doesn’t prevent you from Section 8 eligibility, you will still have to meet the program’s essential criteria. This involves specific citizenship requirements, earning less than 50 percent of the state median income, not having evictions in the past, and not having a history of drug or alcohol abuse.
<h4>Section 8 Emergency Assistance</h4>
As stated in the intro, Section 8 is not considered to be a form of emergency rental assistance. This is because the demand for vouchers is high, and some waiting lists can take years to get through. Some circumstances can accelerate this process, though. If any of the following apply to your situation, you could receive a Section 8 voucher rather quickly:
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<ul>
 	<li>Senior citizens</li>
 	<li>People with mental and physical disabilities</li>
 	<li>Veterans</li>
 	<li>People who are battered and trying to escape physical or sexual abuse</li>
 	<li>The homeless or those facing eviction</li>
 	<li>Displaced due to a natural disaster</li>
 	<li>People paying more than 50 percent of their income towards rent (who, in some cases, must be single parents with young children)</li>
</ul>
The more of those apply, the more priority your application will be given, as each circumstance is assigned specific points.
As for what gets the most priority, that’s usually anyone who’s disabled or senior citizens living on a minimal income.
How fast can you get Section 8 emergency rent assistance? If your felony doesn’t disqualify you and some of those circumstances apply, it could get an emergency Section 8 voucher in a matter of weeks or months. That’s a lot quicker than the typical two-year wait for vouchers.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Get Section 8 as Quickly as Possible</h4>
There are some moves you can make to get Section 8 quickly so you can begin to build your post-felony future. First, you can remain in contact with your PHA every week. Let them know how vital the voucher is, so you become more than just a number on the waiting list.
Second, you can apply to multiple PHAs to increase your chances of getting a voucher faster. Third, you can solicit the help of a social worker for free. They will know the ins and outs of the process and offer some much-needed support. You may find a social worker through legal aid programs, your doctor, or local community agencies."," Section 8 isn’t known as emergency rent assistance, but you can get it quicker if you make the priority waiting list.

When you’re done serving time, you have three tough tasks ahead of you. First, you have to reintegrate back into society. Second, you need to find employment. And third, you need to find suitable housing.
While all three tasks may be daunting, the third one may be the most important, as everyone needs a roof over their head. Here are some tips on how to make that happen, even if you have a felony on your record.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Where to Look for Felon-Friendly Housing</h3>
What’s the number one thing standing between you and securing a home once you’re free again? Your record, which can be discovered by rental management properties or landlords who have the right to run background checks on prospective tenants.
This may seem discriminatory, but it isn’t according to the law. If the background check reveals a felony, even if it’s old, you could be denied housing.
Does this mean you’re out of look when looking for a felon-friendly apartment? Not at all. It just means you have to know where to look, and hopefully find a place that doesn’t require a background check.
Here are some of the top spots to find housing as a felon:
<h4>1. Craigslist</h4>
Why does Craigslist hold the top spot on this list? Because it may be the most felon-friendly site when it comes to housing.
What makes Craigslist so felon-friendly? The fact that many individual landlords list their properties on it, versus other sites where stricter management companies reside. If you can find a landlord on Craigslist, they may be willing to work with you regardless of your record, as they may need your rent as income more than a large company would.
When searching Craigslist, be sure to use the search tool that allows you to enter in what you can afford. This will filter the results and make it easier to pinpoint a property. Also, search for “no credit check apartments” to see if there are any possibilities that will make it easier to rent.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>2. Zumper</h4>
It may not be the most well-known site around, but it could be just what the doctor ordered if you’re looking for a felon-friendly apartment.
On Zumper, you can sometimes see if an apartment is felon-friendly in its description. This will let you know right off the bat if it could be a housing possibility.
When it comes to second-chance apartments that you can rent without a credit or background check, Zumper is tough to beat.
<h4>3. Yelp</h4>
While this site is more known for its reviews of restaurants and other local businesses, you can use it to find felon-friendly apartments too.
Head over to the home page and type in “no background check apartments” into the search box.
<h4>4. Zillow</h4>
As with Yelp, you can use Zillow to look for a felon-friendly apartment. To find the right property, try a search for “no background check” or “no credit check.”
It’s worth noting that Yelp and Zillow will have fewer felon-friendly options, but they’re worth trying, so you can at least see what’s out there in your price range.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Trovit</h4>
On Trovit’s home page, you can select the “For rent” option and type “felony friendly” into the search box. From there, the site will generate a list of felony-friendly apartments according to state. You can do the same by searching “felon friendly” and seeing what’s in your area.","You may have a tougher time finding an apartment as a felon, but it is possible.

If you worry about filling your fridge each week, you may need to apply for long-term food assistance like SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) or WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children).
Both can help you buy the groceries you need to ensure your family’s nutrition is up to par. As stated, however, there is an application process involved. You will have to meet specific requirements based on income and other factors. Most importantly, you will have to wait to receive food from SNAP, WIC, and similar programs.

What can you do if you need food right this moment? Besides making a call to friends, family, or neighbors, you can search for emergency food assistance online. Doing so can help you see where the nearest food bank or pantry is so you can get some supplies to stave off hunger.
While you could do a direct search for food pantries in your area, here are a few websites that make the task much easier.
<h3>Food Pantry Sites</h3>
<h4>Feeding America</h4>
Do you want a directory of almost all of the food pantries and food banks in the U.S.? Feeding America is a site that can give you just that, as it is a network of 60,000-plus food pantries and over 200 food banks that can be found in every state.
Using the Feeding America site to find food assistance couldn’t be easier. Head to its home page, and you can find food distribution sites near you by entering your zip code <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
Once the site generates a list of local food banks or pantries, click on each to see its contact info. Then give them a call or a visit to see if they can help.

3432,"Don’t Search For College Grants Without Reading This First","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->
When you think of how you’ll pay for your costly college education, the thought of scholarships may come up first, since they’re a popular form of free money.
What comes after that? Probably student loans, which are popular, but not exactly ideal since you have to pay them back and they put you in debt as soon as you want to start your professional career.

That’s where grants can save the day, as they’re free money you won’t have to pay back, and they can be less stringent when it comes to requirements, unlike scholarships.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

To ensure you get the most bang for your buck when searching for grants, you’ll have to explore all possibilities. The deeper you look, the more free money you can find. Here’s a glimpse at the different types of grants you can find to help you achieve that goal, so you know where to start your search.
<h3>The Main College Grant Categories</h3>
Once you start searching for college grants, you’ll likely realize that there’s a ton of free money floating around out there to fund your education. So you don’t miss any of it, be sure to look for these main grant categories:
<h4>Federal Government Grants</h4>
Any grant search should begin here since it is the largest category and usually the easiest type of funding to attain.
Federal grants come from the trusty U.S. Department of Education. They include such popular options as the Pell Grant, Academic Competitiveness and National SMART grants, etc.
How do you find federal grants? You can start by going to the Department of Education’s Grants page. To begin applying for these grants, you’ll need to submit your FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
<h4>Grants From the State Where You’re a Resident In</h4>
Your state is another great option for college grants. One of the primary qualifications is that you’ll have to be a resident where you apply. To find out more about your state’s college grants, use this map.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>Grants From the College You Attend</h4>
Besides an excellent location and a solid reputation, there’s no better recruiting tool than free money. That’s why many universities offer grants so they can attract prospective students to their campuses.
Looking at grants your potential colleges have to offer could make deciding on a school much easier. To see what’s available, contact the college’s financial aid office.
<h4>Grants for Different Types of Students</h4>
Some organizations offer grants to minorities, women, disabled students, single parents, adults going back to college, etc. You can search for these online by entering a phrase that corresponds to your situation, such as “single parent college grants.”
<h4>Grants for Certain Careers</h4>
Are you studying medicine? Will you be a law student? Or maybe a teacher? You’ll likely find grants for those courses of study and many more. A simple search for “law student grants,” for example, yields many promising opportunities.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Other Grants</h4>
Some grants exist for very obscure purposes, such as the National Make It With Wool Contest, which offers a $1,000 assistance to the student who makes the best woolen garment. While such grants may be harder to find, they’re great news, as they show that there’s almost no limit to the amount of funding you can find.
Start searching amongst all of the grant categories so you can start stacking cash for your college education.","Is your college grant search comprehensive enough? If you don’t search for grants using the advice in the article, it may not be, and you could be leaving thousands of free dollars on the table.","2021-08-01 04:35:59",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/dont-search-for-college-grants-without-reading-this-first/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1017265534.jpg,shutterstock_1017265534.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1017265534.jpg,3459,shutterstock_1017265534,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1017265534.jpg,"Benefits Assistance",Education,publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,dont-search-for-college-grants-without-reading-this-first,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:53:24"

If you’ve started to look at college grants, you probably know that many can be need-based. In other words, if you can show that you need the money, that can be enough to qualify you for a Pell Grant from the government, for example.
 
While searching for federal need-based grants is a great way to start your quest for free college money, the deeper you dig, the more you’ll find. You can go way beyond federal funding and find grants from the state you live in.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->
 
Your trade school or college may offer grants to recruit students to enroll. You can find assistance for your major or field of study, or if you’re a minority, single parent, disabled, etc. And, as you’ll see in the following list, you can find obscure grants for just about everything under the sun.
 
In short, let this list motivate you to start an exhaustive search for college grants, so you leave no stone unturned. The more you look, the better your chances of significantly reducing the ever-increasing costs of advanced education.
 
<h4>American Association of Cereal Chemists International</h4>
 
Believe it or not, some people study cereal. It’s a grain-based food science that makes it possible to munch on this favored form of quick breakfast every morning. If you’d like to study in this field, give this organization a look, as they sometimes offer grants for those seeking such a career.

<h4>Jewish Vocational Services of Chicago</h4>
 
To show you just how specific some grants can be, this organization offers them to students who are Jewish, residents of the Chicago area, and who are studying community service.
 
<h4>Massage Therapy Foundation</h4>
 
Yes, grants even exist for someone looking to work as a massage therapist. Head to the link above to see what’s available and start applying now. As with most grants, funding is limited, so the sooner you apply, the better.
 
<h4>Truman Library Institute Research Program</h4>
 
If you’re researching the former President Harry S. Truman, a grant from this program can help reduce your expenses. Should you win, you would get up to $2,500 to research at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum.

<h4>Council on International Education Exchange</h4>
 
Imagine getting to study overseas. Not only would it advance your education, but you’d get a valuable life experience as well. What’s better than those benefits? Getting to experience them for free or at a reduced cost, which is what a travel grant for students studying abroad can help you do.
 
<h4>Endangered Language Fund</h4>
 
There are endangered languages around the world that are on the cusp of extinction. This fund offers grants to students focused on ancient languages, such as those used by Native Americans to keep them alive.
 
While this list could go on and on, you should begin your own search to find a grant that fits your unique situation. Be sure to search at the federal, state, and college levels, and don’t forget to look for grants for your ethnicity, field of study, or any other characteristics that could uncover free college cash.","You’d be amazed at how much free money for school is up for grabs via grants.

Keep reading to see what’s expected from you as a Section 8 tenant so you can start getting help with your rent.
You’ve probably been in a standard renting situation before where you made monthly payments to a landlord. In exchange, you were allowed to live on their property.
[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->
Was making payments on time the only part of the agreement? No, as you were probably also asked to abide by specific rules of the property and keep it in good condition.
When you get Section 8 rental assistance, you’ll still live on a property with a landlord. What extra responsibilities will you have? Let’s look at that now.
<h4>Getting a Housing Choice Voucher</h4>
Before we break down the responsibilities of a Section 8 renter, let’s discuss how you become one in the first place.
You’ll need to apply for a voucher through your local public housing agency (PHA). They will assist you through the process and tell you everything you need to know.
The goal here is to get rental assistance that allows you to live in a home that’s not only sanitary, but also safe and decent. How affordable will it be? Quite affordable, as you’ll only have to pay 30 percent of your income towards rent and utilities. The rest of the tab will be picked up by your housing voucher.
If approved for a voucher, your next move will be to wait. This could take some time depending on where you live, as some waiting lists can be lengthy due to the high demand for Section 8 assistance.
After your spot in the waiting list comes up, you’ll need to pick a property that coincides with Section 8’s standards for safety, quality, and cost. Once you do that and select the right single-family home, townhouse, or apartment, it will be time to become a Section 8 tenant officially.
[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>Your Responsibilities as a Section 8 Tenant</h4>
With your property picked out, a one year lease will be necessary. Once the year finishes, your landlord can start another contract, or keep you on month-to-month one.
Read your lease carefully, as your landlord will expect you to abide by its rules. They won’t be the only rules you have to follow, however, as the Housing Choice Voucher program will have its own.
Paying the rent on time will be essential. Your housing voucher will make this easier since it’ll cover any excess amount beyond 30 percent of your income. Know that your voucher will be paid directly to your landlord by the PHA. This will be done promptly, and you’ll be expected to pay your share in the same way.
[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->
As with any rental agreement, you’ll have to keep the property in good condition. You will have to abstain from criminal activity to remain a tenant, as Section 8 looks down particularly hard at any drug-related or violent crimes.
Last but not least, you’ll have to stay in touch with your PHA. If your family composition changes or your income varies, let them know so you can remain eligible for the voucher.","Getting rent assistance through a Housing Choice Voucher can offer more breathing room for your budget, but what responsibilities does it bring?

3512,"Beware: These Holiday Shopping Habits Can Put You In Debt","[the_ad id=""182""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

You may have gone into deep debt so far in 2020 due to one reason: COVID-19. Why? Because if you lost your job and the income came with it, you needed to put bills, groceries, etc. on credit cards or take out personal loans, and all of the above may currently have you financially underwater.

While putting food on the table or paying your monthly bills with credit cards is a must if emergencies hit, this isn’t: Buying holiday gifts.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

To ensure you don’t go into deep debt this holiday season, avoid these shopping mistakes. They’re quite common and can put you in a hole entering 2021.
<h4>1. Buying too many gifts for others.</h4>
If there ever was a year where you have an excuse not to buy so many gifts, it’s this one. Many people’s finances are in shambles, so you’re not alone if you cut back on gift-giving in 2020.

Whether you buy too many gifts per person or want to grab something for every single person you know, this habit will make you run out of cash quickly and lead to whipping out those credit cards.

You can avoid excessive spending on gifts by making baked goods, sending cards, exchanging your time or favors, such as running errands, and more. Remember: It’s the thought that counts.
<h4>2. Buying too many gifts for yourself.</h4>
2020 may be a year where you want to splurge on yourself to feel a bit better about all of the crazy current events. Making such a move can lead to obvious overspending, which will only make you feel worse later on when those bills come in the mail.

When you’re about to make an impulse purchase for yourself this holiday season, wait 24 hours first. This should calm down any desire for unnecessary spending, which can keep more money in your pocket.

[the_ad id=""183""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Instead of buying that item for yourself, put it on your holiday wish list. Then, you can share it with friends and family, so they buy that gift instead.
<h4>3. Not following a plan.</h4>
Hitting the stores, either online or in-person without a plan in place is a recipe for debt-filled disaster. Your entire shopping season will be filled with impulse purchases, and you’ll probably regret it once the new year appears.

To avoid this mistake, make a budget of what you plan to and can afford to spend. Use last year’s spending as your guide, but remember that you may have to reduce it this year due to COVID-19’s economic impact. Don’t forget to add wiggle room for unanticipated expenses too.

Stick to your budget by using only cash. And once you have that number in mind, make a list of planned gifts and expenditures to match it. If something isn’t on your list, it doesn’t get purchased.
<h4>4. Obsessing over expensive gifts.</h4>
As mentioned, it’s the thought that counts. If you go into this holiday season trying to outdo everyone else by buying expensive gifts, you’ll leave yourself with a financial headache in the near future.

Most people won’t expect gifts at all this year due to the pandemic, so don’t feel bad about not going all out when it comes to a product’s price tag.
<h4>5. Buying without doing your research.</h4>
There’s no excuse to not comparison shop nowadays. Apps like ShopSavvy, Yroo, and Shopbrain make it incredibly easy to find the lowest price for a product.

Research is now super simple, with the ability to scan barcodes in stores to see the best price and product reviews.
<h4>6. Opening various store cards.</h4>
Be prepared for a rush of credit card offers from some of your favorite stores. They’ll promise certain savings on a transaction, but many carry expensive fees, low credit limits, and high interest rates that’ll make you regret opening one.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>7. The fear of missing out.</h4>
“FOMO,” as some call it, is a real thing that marketers love to exploit. The fear of missing out can hit you hard during the holidays when sales run rampant, so ask yourself this: Would you buy the item if it wasn’t on sale? Do you need it?

If not, don’t give in and stick to your list instead.","Do you wish to make it through this holiday season without going into debt?

<h4>See What’s Expected From You As A Section 8 Tenant</h4>
If you use the tool discussed in the link above, you may notice that some affordable Section 8 housing is near you. While Section 8 can certainly help you save a ton of money on rent, it does come with certain rules you’ll have to follow in order to remain a tenant.

You’ll want to follow these rules so you don’t break your contract, which is why you should read this before even applying for a Section 8 housing voucher: <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/see-whats-expected-from-you-as-a-section-8-tenant/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">See What’s Expected From You As A Section 8 Tenant</a>.

Imagine how having a bit more extra cash could make your current life easier. It would be easier to pay your bills. You could get rid of some debt and the overly-aggressive collectors that come with it. You could also start saving to give yourself a bit of a cushion for any future emergencies.

How can you get that extra cash? The most conventional answer would be to look for a higher-paying job, work extended hours, or find a second job. Are those your only options? Of course not, as here are some other ideas that could help you boost your income.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Make Deliveries</h4>
Do you have some form of transportation? Can you follow directions? If you answered yes to both of those questions, you could make deliveries for a nice chunk of change.

Will you be stuck delivering pizzas for tiny tips? Only if you want to, as there are so many delivery options nowadays that you can pick what you’d like to deliver.

For instance, you could work at grocery stores, pick out other people’s items, and deliver them to their door. You could pick up orders at restaurants as well. And, if you don’t want to deal with food, there are other delivery services that stray from it.

Some of the more popular delivery services you could work for include Postmates and DoorDash.
<h4>Drive</h4>
Provided it’s not too old, you can put your car to good use and become a driver for Uber, Lyft, or some other rideshare service.

Many people drive as a side gig to earn extra cash, and it also gives you tons of flexibility over your schedule.
<h4>Do Odd Jobs</h4>
If you seek something that offers variety in terms of tasks, signing up for a site like TaskRabbit may be your best bet. What’s so good about it? The fact that TaskRabbit has so many services clients need, that you’re bound to find a few you can offer.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

A quick look at the site shows these odd jobs that could easily pad your income without having to commit a ton of time:
<ul>
 	<li>Shopping</li>
 	<li>Personal assistant</li>
 	<li>Home repairs</li>
 	<li>Cooking/baking</li>
 	<li>Decoration help</li>
 	<li>Running errands</li>
 	<li>Organization</li>
 	<li>Yardwork</li>
 	<li>Cleaning</li>
 	<li>Moving help</li>
 	<li>Wait in line</li>
 	<li>Shipping</li>
 	<li>Painting</li>
 	<li>Packing</li>
 	<li>Party help</li>
 	<li>Research</li>
 	<li>Computer help</li>
 	<li>Furniture assembly</li>
 	<li>Laundry help</li>
 	<li>Car washing</li>
</ul>
As you can see, that’s quite the list of available services you could provide. But it’s just a tiny fraction of what’s on the site.

Do you have to use TaskRabbit if you want to complete odd jobs for extra income? Of course not. It’s just an example of what’s out there to get you brainstorming on how to bring in more money without being stuck with a typical job.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Another site worth browsing is Craigslist. Depending on where you live, you could find new side gigs posted every hour. Many don’t require experience, so feel free to jump in and claim your piece of the pie.","If a little bit of extra cash could go a long way in your life, you’ll want to keep reading to discover several ways to earn it.","2020-12-22 20:24:58",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/cant-think-of-ways-to-make-some-extra-money-read-this/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1477663070.jpg,shutterstock_1477663070.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1477663070.jpg,3530,shutterstock_1477663070,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1477663070.jpg,"Financial Help","#Help For Families",publish,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,cant-think-of-ways-to-make-some-extra-money-read-this,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-11 20:15:32"
3533,"See How Much Your Section 8 Housing Voucher Could Be Worth","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

You may daydream about having more money in your monthly budget and how much of a difference it would make in your life. For example, it could help you save for a rainy day so you can sleep better at night. You could use it to pay off debt and get bill collectors off of your back. Or you could simply use that extra money to treat yourself for all of your hard work.

Regardless of what you’d do with more wiggle room in your budget, this is the best way to get it: Reduce your rent costs. Rent, after all, is probably your biggest expense every month. But unless you move somewhere else or get a roommate to split the costs, your rent probably won’t get any cheaper. Or will it?

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

There is a way to get cheaper rent, and it’s through the government’s Section 8 program. With a housing voucher, you can get a portion of your rent paid by Uncle Sam, which automatically makes it cheaper and gives you that more flexible monthly budget to work with.

Just how much cheaper can rent become with a housing voucher? Let’s break it down now.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>The Value of Section 8 Housing Vouchers</h4>
When it comes to Section 8, your income decides how much you’ll have to pay the landlord each month. The more income you make, the bigger the rent check you’ll have to write.

The Section 8 standard is to pay 30 percent of your income in rent. So, if you make $1,500 per month, you’ll pay $450 towards the rent. If the apartment costs $1,000 per month, the voucher will pay the remaining $550, so your landlord is paid in full.

What can cause you to pay more rent out of pocket? If the property you want to live in is more expensive than the Fair Market Rent. The HUD establishes this amount by looking at other rentals in the area. It’s a number used to ensure that the housing you pick is affordable.

Pick a more expensive property, and you’ll not only have to pay that 30 percent of your income, but you’ll also end up paying the difference above the Fair Market Rent.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Getting a Section 8 Voucher</h4>
As you can expect, many people are lining up to get Section 8 vouchers so they can save a bunch on their monthly rent expenses. This demand means that you probably won’t be able to get a voucher within days, weeks, or even months. In fact, you may end up waiting years until your spot on the waiting list comes up.

Keeping this in mind, you should apply for your voucher now by contacting your Public Housing Agency so you can accelerate the process.","The thought of getting a Section 8 housing voucher may seem great, but how much does it actually amount to?

3588,"What You Should Know Before Paying For Car Insurance","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>1. The bigger the car, the higher the premium</h4>
What do you see on the roads nowadays? A ton of huge SUVs and trucks. And while having such a vehicle may seem like it’d be safe, that doesn’t mean insurance will be cheaper. In fact, larger, newer, and more expensive SUVs and trucks can come with higher insurance premiums, even if they give you that secure feeling of riding around in a tank.

Unless you truly need something so big, you may want to consider a smaller commuter car that’ll not only cost less to insure, but it’ll also <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/6-ways-youre-wasting-money-on-your-car/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">save you on gas</a>. And speaking of gas, buying a vehicle that uses alternative fuel or a hybrid can lead to insurance savings. You can get a five percent discount this way through Farmers, for example.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Your agent may have secrets.</h4>
You may be so excited about your new car that you’ll want to rush through the process of getting insurance to cover it. If this happens, you may miss out on some relatively unknown discounts that could lead to significant savings. In short, don’t trust that your insurance agent will automatically do everything in their power to get you the lowest premium. Ask them what discounts are out there so you can maximize your savings.

If you’re unsure of how to proceed here, have a look at these questions you can ask your agent:
<ol>
 	<li>Do you have any discounts for military service? (If you’ve served)</li>
 	<li>Do you have any discounts for members of ____? (If you’re a member of a special group or organization)</li>
 	<li>Do you offer discounts for e-bills or electronic documents? (Versus the old fashioned paper format)</li>
 	<li>Can I get a discount if I pay my premium upfront? (If you can pay your six months or a full year of premiums at the moment)</li>
</ol>
<h4>3. Competition works in your favor.</h4>
There’s no need to take insurance from the first company you contact. With the Internet at your disposal, you can shop around with ease in a matter of minutes or even seconds. And since there’s so much competition, skipping this part of the process could be your biggest mistake.

While price is probably important, don’t let the cheapest offer sway you without doing a bit of research. You want your insurance company to have solid ratings since you may have to work with them closely in the case of an accident.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>4. Your car may not be worth it.</h4>
If you’re low on funds and buy a used car that’s extremely old with little value, you may not need certain coverage. In fact, paying for collision or comprehensive coverage may not make any sense at all.

Why? Because the cost of the coverage could outweigh the value of the car. And if you total the car in an accident by the insurance company’s standards, that money spent on unnecessary premiums could have gone down the drain.
<h4>5. Place an importance on security.</h4>
If you’re choosing between a car that’s loaded with anti-theft devices and one that has no such security features, the former may be your best bet when it comes to insurance.
It’s no secret that insurance companies offer discounts for anti-theft devices, and some of these rebates can be quite high.

You can slash your premium by 25 percent if you have an anti-theft device and choose GEICO for your insurance needs, for example.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Paying as you go may be your best bet.</h4>
If you’re buying a car for occasional use and don’t plan on driving a lot of miles, pay-as-you-go insurance may be your best option for savings. With this type of insurance, a device will be installed in your car to track your mileage, driving habits, and when you drive.

Such tracking may seem intrusive, but it can lead to much cheaper insurance. Some examples of pay-as-you-go coverage include State Farm’s Safe &amp; Save and Progressive’s Snapshot.","If you’re thinking about buying a car and are worried about insurance costs, here are some things to consider before making that purchase.","2021-05-26 04:40:29",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/what-you-should-know-before-paying-for-car-insurance/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_765356473.jpg,shutterstock_765356473.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_765356473.jpg,3589,shutterstock_765356473,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_765356473.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,3,lodum,lodum@hardshiprecovery.com,Leslie,Odum,what-you-should-know-before-paying-for-car-insurance,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-18 04:10:00"

<h3>The Best Places To Find Scholarships</h3>
If you think scholarships are only found in one place, like the school you’re planning to attend, think again. You’ll want to look in as many places as possible to ensure you don’t miss any financial aid opportunities, and here are some of the top spots for finding that funding:
<h4>1. Your personal connections.</h4>
No, we’re not suggesting you reach out to friends and family to ask for a loan. Instead, talk to friends and family and ask if they know of any scholarships tied to the companies they work for. If they’re members of professional unions, you may have luck there as well.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Your school.</h4>
Once your personal connections are checked off the list, turn to the school where you’re looking to study. You can begin by contacting the financial aid office and asking for scholarship opportunities. They may point you in the direction of on-campus alumni offices or the specific department you plan to major in.
<h4>3. Scholarship book directories.</h4>
Some books can open your eyes to all of the scholarships that are currently available. Even if you don’t find the right fit, a scholarship book directory can break down how funding is offered according to the field of study, interests, activities, and so on. This can give you ideas on how to search online for even more money.
<h4>4. The Internet.</h4>
You may choose this as your first option, just to see what’s out there without having to do a ton of work or make several calls. When searching for scholarships online, try different routes. For instance, you can search scholarships for your field of study. You can then move on to scholarships for specific interests or activities you partake in.

Don’t limit yourself here, as there are scholarships for almost everything under the sun. In short, get creative with your search.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h3>Preparing Yourself for the Process</h3>
Instead of jumping right in and applying for scholarships, you want to be prepared. The more prepared you are, the better your chances of winning that funding for school.

To begin the prepping process, make a list of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Accomplishments</li>
 	<li>Interests</li>
 	<li>Activities</li>
 	<li>Goals for the future</li>
</ul>
Take your time when making this list. The goal is to lay out different angles for scholarships since some can be extremely specific. You’ll want to use this list in your search, as well as in bolstering your applications so you can stand out from the competition.

Once that list is complete, make a portfolio with the following from your past:
<ul>
 	<li>Poems</li>
 	<li>Essays</li>
 	<li>Projects</li>
 	<li>Papers</li>
</ul>
You may be able to use some of them when applying, so you don’t have to waste time writing something new.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Increasing Your Chances of Winning</h3>
You won’t be the only student applying for scholarships, so do your best to be unique. Find what scholarship committees are looking for by contacting them directly. With that insider info, you can craft your application to fit their desires to the T.

When completing your application or writing an essay, emphasize how you’ll impact others with your education, not just your own life. The greater the perceived impact, the greater your chances of winning the scholarship.","Now that you’ve decided it’s time to get your degree, you’ll have to find ways to pay for your education.

<h4>Food Stamps aka SNAP</h4>

3648,"Section 8: How To Prepare For Meeting A Landlord","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Why is the Section 8 program so popular? Because its housing vouchers help pay a portion of the rent. In doing so, they make it easier to save your cash while also allowing you to live in safe, decent housing without breaking the bank.

There’s a misconception that getting a Section 8 voucher means you'll live in public housing, when that’s not necessarily the case. Instead, you can use your voucher to live where you want, provided that the rent is within a certain range. This allows you to pick between single-family homes, apartments, and townhomes.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since you pick the property, you’ll be dealing with a landlord, just as if you were looking to rent a place independently. Even though having the voucher means that you’re almost home, you’ll still need to convince the landlord to accept you as a tenant. If not, you’ll have to use your voucher somewhere else.

To ensure your interview with a landlord goes well so you can get the keys to your new place, follow these tips:
<h4>1. Take classes.</h4>
Community Action Agencies exist all across the country, and they can help you prepare for everything that Section 8 entails. For instance, you can take classes on becoming a renter, how to be a good tenant, and housing readiness. Not only will these classes give you valuable information you can use in the future, but you can also mention them to any potential landlords. Think of the classes as instant resume boosters that show you’ve taken the proper steps to become a responsible tenant.
<h4>2. Get free copies of your credit reports.</h4>
A landlord will run your credit and may ask about any past issues. By having your credit reports handy, you’ll be able to answer questions easily.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>3. Fix any substance abuse issues.</h4>
If you’ve had problems with substance abuse in the past, be sure to complete treatment programs. Use this as proof to your landlord that you won’t be a problematic tenant, despite any past mistakes.
<h4>4. Set the interview.</h4>
Call the landlord in a quiet setting where kids aren’t yelling, or dogs aren’t barking. Be polite when asking for a meeting, and avoid talking about past problems. You can discuss them in person, where you can better defend yourself if need be.
<h4>5. Be professional.</h4>
Show up to the interview on time (15 minutes early is best). Dress your best. You may also want to keep your kids at home if you know they’ll be loud and hard to handle, as you want the interview to go smoothly.
<h4>6. Be inquisitive.</h4>
Don’t be afraid to ask plenty of questions about the home. The more, the better, as it shows you’re serious about moving in and are interested in what the property has to offer.
<h4>7. Ask about screening.</h4>
If the home passes your initial eye test and you like what you see, ask the landlord how they screen tenants so you can get the ball rolling. If they screen you on the spot, be polite and don’t blame any issues on past landlords. Accept responsibility instead.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. Get a reading on the landlord.</h4>
You can be direct and ask the landlord if they’d be willing to rent to you. If they say they’re unsure, ask what you can do to show them you’d be a worthy tenant.
<h4>9. Move on.</h4>
If the landlord seems hard to work with, rude, or if the property has problems, don’t be afraid to move on to the next opportunity.

Now that you see how to have a successful interaction with a Section 8 landlord, it’s time to apply for a housing voucher, if you haven’t already done so. You can do so by <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going here</a> and learning more about the Section 8 program.","Rent can become a lot cheaper with a housing voucher from the Section 8 program.

3731,"6 Ways You’re Wasting Money On Your Car","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

What happens if you don’t maintain your car? It could develop mechanical problems that begin small but end big. Does this mean that all types of recommended car maintenance are necessary? No, and we’ll take a look at a few that you may want to skip to save cash.

Note: While these tips can save you money and time at the mechanic, do your research before making any final decisions on maintenance, as many factors are involved, such as the car’s age, condition, etc.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Using premium fuel.</h4>
You should fill up your car with the highest-octane gas available, right? Not necessarily. If you have a luxury or high-performance car, then yes, high-octane gas may not only be good, but needed for the car to run without issues. But unless your car’s manual says you need 93 octane, go with the lower recommendation. Not only will it keep your car running as intended, but it’ll keep more cash in your pocket per fill-up.
<h4>2. Buying headlight restoration kits.</h4>
Do car headlights tend to become foggy and yellow over the years? Yes. Does this mean you need a pricy headlight restoration kit so they operate correctly and look new? No.

To get the job done, look up a do-it-yourself video on YouTube. You can usually make your headlights like new with nothing more than a bit of time, sandpaper, and warm soapy water.
<h4>3. Getting frequent synthetic oil changes.</h4>
This is probably the most common maintenance move where car owners spend more money than they should.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

For starters, unless you have an old vehicle, frequently tow heavy objects, or drive in extreme weather, you probably don’t need to get your oil changed every 3,000 miles. That outdated guideline was made when motor oil and cars weren’t as technologically advanced.

As for the type of oil, synthetic oil isn’t a must either unless your car carries a high-performance engine under the hood. Dealerships use this 3,000-mile synthetic oil recommendation to make as much profit as possible, when you really don’t need it.
<h4>4. Taking it to the dealership versus an independent mechanic.</h4>
Is your car still under warranty? If so, take it to the dealership so you can get service that’s covered. If not, try an independent local mechanic who will probably be a lot cheaper.
<h4>5. Paying for tune-ups.</h4>
What can a regular tune-up give you? Peace of mind knowing that someone looked over your car to see if anything was wrong. Is this service worth paying for, though?

Probably not, as modern cars have onboard computers that do the job for you. As they regularly scan for issues, car computers can tell you when something’s wrong, so you can then take it to the mechanic.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Getting extended warranties.</h4>
Such warranties are quite popular nowadays, as people don’t want to pay for repairs out of their own pockets. However, with an extended warranty, you may pay more for that peace of mind than you would for repairs.

Before buying an extended warranty, read the fine print. It may not cover what you think it does, making it a waste of money.","You may have the best intentions when it comes to keeping your car in tip-top shape.

3736,"Section 8 Inspection FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions on Section 8 Inspections</h3>
<h4>How often are inspections performed?</h4>
The first Section 8 inspection will happen after you pick a property, such as an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. Before you can move in, an inspector will check to see that the property meets the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. Once it’s deemed safe, you can move into the property.

After that, you can expect Section 8 inspections every year, although they could happen on an as-needed basis. If there are health or safety issues, you or your landlord could request an inspection from the Public Housing Agency (PHA).

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What do inspectors look for?</h4>
Section 8 inspectors check to see that the property meets the following performance requirements set by the HUD:
<ul>
 	<li>Water supply</li>
 	<li>Thermal environment</li>
 	<li>Structure and materials</li>
 	<li>Space and security</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Site and neighborhood</li>
 	<li>Sanitary facilities</li>
 	<li>Sanitary conditions</li>
 	<li>Lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Interior air quality</li>
 	<li>Illumination and electricity</li>
 	<li>Food preparation and refuse disposal</li>
 	<li>Access</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

They want to see that the house is safe, decent, and sanitary, which is what the criteria above helps them figure out.
<h4>What happens if you fail an inspection?</h4>
Believe it or not, you can fail a Section 8 property inspection if just one issue is found. You’ll be given time to fix the issue, after which the inspector will come back. If the problem is fixed, you’ll be fine. If not, the landlord will have to let you move if it’s their fault. And if it’s your fault, you may lose your voucher.
<h4>Are there any red flags inspectors look for?</h4>
Some specific issues that could put you on the fast path towards a failed inspection include:
<ul>
 	<li>Broken doors, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, or windows.</li>
 	<li>Dirty or unusable appliances.</li>
 	<li>Garbage hoarding.</li>
 	<li>Holes or stains in ceilings.</li>
 	<li>Walls littered with holes, grease, graffiti, or mold.</li>
 	<li>Tears, stains, punctures, holes, or burns in floors.</li>
 	<li>Flea infestation from pets.</li>
 	<li>Utilities that are turned off for non-payment.</li>
 	<li>Uncut grass, high weeds, and other examples of neglected landscaping.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Is there anything you can do to prepare for a Section 8 inspection?</h4>
Since failing an inspection could lead you to lose your voucher that you may have waited years to receive, it’s crucial to prepare. If not, you could find yourself scrambling to finish repairs at the last minute.

The two biggest things you can do to prepare for a Section 8 home inspection are:
<ol>
 	<li>Ask your landlord to make the necessary repairs.</li>
 	<li>Maintain your home throughout your lease, so problems don’t pile up.</li>
</ol>
Your lease agreement should outline what your landlord is responsible for. Let them know what needs to be fixed before the inspection comes. And if it’s a problem you caused, take care of it before the inspector arrives.

If your landlord refuses, you can contact your PHA and request an inspection to show that there is, in fact, a problem. If they don’t fix it, you may be allowed to move elsewhere.

Again, maintaining the property throughout your lease is your best bet to passing inspection every time. And it will also give you the added benefit of putting a safe, clean roof over your loved ones’ heads.","You’ll be dealing with inspections as you receive Section 8 assistance.

3739,"A Pre-Application Checklist For Section 8 Housing","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

You may have always paid your rent on time, until the events of the past year popped up. Losing your job or seeing a drop in income may have made it hard to pay your landlord, which made you think: Is there a way to reduce my rent?

In actuality, there are several ways to reduce your rent. Some of the more common methods include moving to a smaller home, relocating to a less expensive city, getting a roommate, or moving in with friends and family. But what if none of those options appeal to you?

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

If that’s the case, here’s another way to reduce your rent: Get a Housing Choice Voucher from the government’s Section 8 program. With it, you’ll only have to pay about 30 percent of your income towards the rent. The government will pay the rest via your voucher. And in the end, this can result in significant savings so you can gain housing stability and reduce stress.

Unfortunately, everyone can’t receive Section 8 housing assistance. It’s limited not only to low-income households, but also in its funding. There are many people seeking to make rent more affordable through Section 8, making the competition fierce. And since you could spend a year or more on a waiting list for your voucher, you’ll want to pre-screen yourself to ensure you have a chance of getting approved.

Before you apply for Section 8 and commence the potentially long waiting process, consider the following:
<h4>1. Do you meet immigration status requirements?</h4>
To qualify for Section 8, at least one person in the household must have legal immigration status. What happens if other household members don’t have it? They won’t be counted when it comes to how much you’ll get for your voucher.

If at least you have legal immigration status, you should be good to go here.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->
<h4>2. Do you have a criminal history?</h4>
If there’s one thing that can keep you from getting approved for Section 8, it’s a criminal history.
This doesn’t mean you’ll be automatically disqualified if you have a record, as some felons or people on parole still get accepted. However, if the following apply, you may find it impossible to get a Section 8 voucher:
<ul>
 	<li>Eviction for drug problems within the last three years.</li>
 	<li>Being listed on the lifelong sex offender registry.</li>
 	<li>Conviction for methamphetamine production in federal housing.</li>
</ul>
Each Public Housing Agency differs in how they deal with criminal history. Contact yours to see if you can make it regardless of your past.
<h4>3. Is your income low enough?</h4>
Since Section 8 is meant to help low-income households, you’ll have to make below a certain amount for your area. You can see income limits <a href=""https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to get a better idea of where you stand.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Have you picked a location?</h4>
You don’t have to live in your current city. You can use your Section 8 voucher to move somewhere else. Research places where you’d like to live, then contact PHAs in those areas to see how you can start the application process.","Since it can take quite a while to get a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher, you’ll want to make sure you have a chance of approval before you jump into this lengthy process.

3742,"Don’t Just “Wait” For Your Section 8 Voucher. Do These 6 Things","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

What does it mean when you get placed on a Section 8 waitlist? Unfortunately, it doesn’t mean that you’re home free just yet. Instead, it’s a sign that you qualify for a Housing Choice Voucher. What’s next? Waiting until one becomes available so you can use it to get affordable rent.

Just how affordable can a Housing Choice Voucher make your rent? Very, as you’ll only have to pay around 30 percent of your income to the landlord, while the voucher will take care of the rest.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the main downside with vouchers? The long wait you may experience until you finally get to use yours. And depending on where you’re looking to live, that wait could take multiple years.

To make your wait a bit more bearable, follow these tips. Not only can they help you avoid any unnecessary delays, but they can also give you some peace of mind until that Housing Choice Voucher is yours.
<h4>1. Check on your voucher’s status.</h4>
There are two main ways to check the status of your Housing Choice Voucher. The first is to call your Public Housing Agency (PHA) every two to three months. When you do, ask them to confirm that you’re still on the waitlist. Then ask if you’ve been moving up at all.

The second way to check your voucher status is to use the Waitlistcheck website from the HUD. By staying on top of your situation using these two methods, you won’t have the anxiety that comes with not knowing where you stand.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>2. Try other waitlists.</h4>
Some waitlists are slower than others. A lot of this has to do with the supply and demand for vouchers in the area. To avoid depending on just one waitlist and PHA, apply to several when they are open. This will increase your chances of getting a voucher quicker.
<h4>3. Avoid delays.</h4>
An error in your application could result in a delay that’s not your fault. Mistakes can happen, so you’ll need to be on the lookout for correspondence from your PHA via phone, mail, or email. As soon as you get it, respond, so you don’t end up wasting time. And whenever there is correspondence, take notes and document it. You may need it later on if there’s an issue.
<h4>4. Provide updates as needed.</h4>
Your PHA needs to know if anything changes with your household’s income, family composition, location, immigration status, etc. All of these factors can impact your voucher, so if anything changes, update your PHA as soon as possible.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Get support.</h4>
Sitting on a Section 8 waitlist can trigger anxiety, especially if you need help with paying the rent now. To combat this, look for Section 8 Facebook Groups and message boards online. You can connect with others in your situation, gain support, and learn more about how Section 8 works. All of those benefits can help make time fly by a bit quicker.
<h4>6. Don’t give up.</h4>
Can it take a long time to get a Section 8 voucher, even if you qualify? Sure, but remember why you’re waiting in the first place: To make rent affordable well into the future.

Do everything possible to fix your finances until your voucher becomes available. This includes cutting costs, moving somewhere cheaper, getting a second job, etc.","Don’t let up once you’re placed on the Section 8 waiting list.

3745,"6 Ways To Accelerate Section 8 Wait Times","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

The Section 8 program offers immense benefits to those who qualify. By paying most of your rent with a voucher, you can enjoy affordable housing and all of the perks that come with it. But there is one downside to Section 8, and that’s the waiting list.

While your goal is to get on the Section 8 waiting list, it can take over a year to reach your turn. You can combat this long wait time by applying to multiple waiting lists. You could also use the following circumstances to your advantage, as Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) give them priority over other applicants:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Homelessness</h4>
PHAs tend to move homeless people towards the front of Section 8 waiting lists due to their dire situations. You’ll need to check with your PHA to see how they define homelessness. If you live with friends and family, for instance, you may not be considered homeless.
<h4>2. Living in a Shelter</h4>
The Section 8 program's central goal is to get families off of the streets or shelters and into their own homes. If you’re living in a shelter or some other form of emergency housing, don’t forget to tell your PHA. It could get you moved towards the front of the waitlist.
<h4>3. Having Extremely Low Income</h4>
Section 8 was created with low-income families in mind. To qualify for the program, you’ll need to make below a certain income. PHAs often have three tiers of income where they place applicants:

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<ol>
 	<li>Low – The household makes 80% of the median income for the area.</li>
 	<li>Very low – The household makes 50% of the median income for the area.</li>
 	<li>Extremely low - The household makes 30% of the median income for the area.</li>
</ol>
Falling into that third income category can give you priority over others. In fact, over ¾ of Section 8 applicants that get approved for vouchers earn extremely low incomes. Be sure to tell your PHA if you fall in this group.
<h4>4. Age 62 or Older</h4>
Beyond helping low-income families gain access to safe, affordable housing, Section 8 also aims to help elderly citizens. By definition, “elderly” is 62 or older.
<h4>5. Having a Disability</h4>
Does anyone in your household have a disability? This could accelerate your Section 8 wait time, too, especially if your current housing isn’t sufficient.

For instance, if a family member has asthma and you live in a place with low air quality, that could help you get your voucher quicker. You’ll need to show medical documentation to prove this, but the extra work is worth it.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Being a Veteran</h4>
If someone in your household served in the military and was honorably discharged, their status as a veteran could help you receive your voucher faster.

Can you use more than one of these circumstances to move up the Section 8 waitlist? Of course, you can.

Know that you’re not alone. And know that these resources can give you the help you need during this “new normal.”

They said it would only take two weeks to flatten the curve. That was many months ago. Has the coronavirus disappeared as promised? Not really, as we still have to deal with its presence every day by wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and more.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While masks and social distancing are easy enough to deal with, this isn’t: Financial problems. Many of us are experiencing them, and this can make us feel isolated and frustrated. But instead of fretting over financial problems, it’s best to fix them with help from others.

The following are some simple steps you can take to start tackling pandemic-caused problems head-on. At the very least, you should get some assistance that can hold you over until you get your finances in order as we slowly try to crush this virus for good.

<h4>1. Talk to someone from 211.</h4>
Chances are, your financial issues combined with safety concerns about the coronavirus have you feeling overwhelmed. If that’s the case, hearing a voice that can advise where to find assistance may be what you need most right now.

How can you hear that voice? By dialing 2-1-1 on your phone and connecting with a local operator who’s well-versed in all of the forms of assistance in your area.

For instance, let’s say you’re having problems with your landlord since you cannot pay the rent. Or you need to put food on the table, but you have no money to do so. By calling 211, you can explain your situation and let the operator connect you with the exact type of assistance you need.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

You can <a href=""https://www.211.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0563c1; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">read up on how 211 works by visiting their site</span></a><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""> or giving them a call.</span>
<h4>2. Visit the USA.gov website.</h4>
There are plenty of coronavirus scams out there looking to take advantage of people in need. That’s why you need to visit a trusted website to find assistance, which is precisely <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/help-with-bills"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0563c1; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">what USA.gov is.</span></a>

It’s an official site from the U.S. government. And it has information on every assistance program under the sun that can help you pay your bills during the pandemic.
<h4>3. Apply for unemployment benefits.</h4>
Chances are, you could really use a hand in replacing lost income due to the coronavirus shutdowns. Your state’s Unemployment Insurance program can provide that helping hand.

<h4>4. Learn more about eviction protections.</h4>
How can you pay your rent or mortgage if you lost your job or income due to COVID-19? It can be impossible to do so, which is why you’ll need to read up on eviction protections in your area that can buy you some time. You can <a href=""https://legalfaq.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0563c1; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">do that by going here.</span></a>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Get utility assistance.</h4>
As you try to find work or keep it together until the pandemic passes, you’ll need to keep your lights on. Contact your utility company to see if they offer payment plans or assistance with paying your bill. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) can also make your utility bills more affordable, so <a href=""https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0563c1; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">see if you qualify by going here</span></a><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">.</span>

Whether you now need reliable Internet at home for work or study purposes, here’s how to get it without paying an arm and a leg.

What did you primarily use the Internet for before the pandemic started? If you’re like many, it was probably used mainly for entertainment and basic information. For instance, your family may have used the Internet to stream content via Netflix, YouTube, and the like. You may have used it to buy things online. Or perhaps you used the home Internet to connect with friends and family via social media.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

All of those uses could be seen as luxuries. But now, due to COVID-19, you may need to use the Internet for two necessities:
<ol>
 	<li>To work from home if your office was closed due to the coronavirus.</li>
 	<li>To let your kids attend virtual classes if their schools were shuttered due to COVID-19.</li>
</ol>
Work and school can’t be put on the back burner, so you now need to make room for an Internet bill in your monthly budget. But what if you hardly have any space? Don’t fret, as the following options are very affordable. Pick one today, and you could get the cheap Internet you need soon:
<h4>Comcast</h4>
What’s one thing that keeps many from getting home Internet service? The fear of a credit check or having to commit to a long-term contract. With Comcast Internet Essentials, no credit check or contract is required, so you can get connected without the commitment.

As for the cost, Internet Essentials will only set you back $9.95 monthly plus tax, which is very doable even on a limited income.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

While the thought of no credit check, contract, and under $10 Internet is probably enticing, here’s an added perk that could make you look Comcast’s way: They’re offering two complimentary months of service due to the coronavirus.
<h4>AT&amp;T</h4>
The coronavirus shutdowns caused many of us to spend a lot more time at home. What do you do when stuck inside? You use the Internet a lot, which could cause concerns when it comes to overage fees.

Access from AT&amp;T has currently waived data overage fees since they know usage is higher during the pandemic. Not only is that worry erased, but you can also get cheap Internet from Access for $10 per month with dependable speeds of 25Mbps.

Qualifying for Access’ low-cost Internet is as easy as your child being eligible for the National School Lunch Program. If they get those free or reduced lunches, you could be good to go.
<h4>Mediacom</h4>
Here’s another low-income Internet program that uses the National School Lunch Program to determine eligibility. If you qualify for Mediacom Connect 2 Compete, you can get Internet for $9.95 per month plus tax with no:
<ul>
 	<li>Deposit</li>
 	<li>Contract</li>
 	<li>Equipment rental fees</li>
 	<li>Installation costs</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Verizon</h4>
This option is ideal if you’re seeking affordable Internet that’s very fast. You can get 200Mbps speeds for $19.99 monthly plus taxes and fees from the Verizon Lifeline Discount Program. Such speeds should suffice for everything you can think of.
<h4>Your Current Internet Company</h4>
Have you called your current Internet provider yet? If you have one and you haven’t made that call, do so. A quick explanation of your situation could lead them to offer you a discount or make a manageable payment plan.","Internet service has gone from a luxury to a necessity nowadays, with the coronavirus pandemic accelerating that need.

3756,"COVID-19 Stimulus Checks FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>1. What’s the purpose of the COVID-19 stimulus checks?</h4>
The federal government released the stimulus checks or Economic Impact Payments for two main reasons: 1. To help families struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic. 2. To stimulate the economy.
<h4>2. When were the stimulus checks approved?</h4>
The first coronavirus stimulus was approved in March 2020. The second was approved in December 2020.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. How much are the stimulus checks?</h4>
The first stimulus offered payments of $1,200 per eligible adult and $500 per dependent child. The second followed up with lower adult payments at $600 each, while child payments were increased to $600 each.
<h4>4. Does everyone get a stimulus payment?</h4>
No, as there are eligibility requirements you must pass, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>You must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien.</li>
 	<li>You cannot be a dependent who was claimed on somebody else’s tax return.</li>
 	<li>You must have a Social Security number valid for employment.Y</li>
 	<li>ou must make less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income as an individual.</li>
 	<li>You must make less than $112,500 as a head of household filer.</li>
 	<li>You must make less than $150,000 as a married couple filing jointly.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>5. What if you make more than the income limits? Do you still get a check?</h4>
You can earn more than the limits listed above and still get a check, although it will be smaller than the max amounts. If you’re an individual, you can make up to $99,000 in adjusted gross income and still get a stimulus payment. Heads of households can make up to $136,500, while married couples’ income can go up to $198,000.
<h4>6. How are Economic Impact Payments distributed?</h4>
Your stimulus payment can come in the mail in the form of a check or a prepaid debit card. You can also get it through direct deposit. If that’s your payment method, look for the funds in the same bank account where you received your last tax refund or other federal benefits like Social Security.
<h4>7. What should you do if you haven’t received your stimulus payments yet?</h4>
Since these payments are tied to your tax returns, file a 2020 return if you’re still waiting on a payment. You’ll need to do this even if you don’t usually file tax returns. Otherwise, you won’t receive a stimulus check.

If you need help filing your tax return, you can get it at no cost through <a href=""http://www.myfreetaxes.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the MyFreeTaxes service</a>. You can also get help with any other questions on your stimulus checks by contacting IRS-certified volunteers <a href=""https://www.getyourrefund.org/en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a> or calling the 211 Economic Impact Payment Helpline at 844-322-3639.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. Are there any stimulus check scams to watch out for?</h4>
Yes, and most have to do with scammers seeking your information. If you get a text, email, call, or social media message from someone pretending to be the IRS or United Way, ignore it. They may do so to ask you to verify information to receive your check as a way to steal your data.","You may have questions about your checks, so keep reading to see if we have the answers you’ve been looking for.","2021-04-01 18:53:28",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/covid-19-stimulus-checks-faq/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1716032503.jpg,shutterstock_1716032503.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1716032503.jpg,3757,shutterstock_1716032503,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1716032503.jpg,"Covid Relief","Covid Relief",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,covid-19-stimulus-checks-faq,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-06 16:34:18"

We’ll show you where to find a free phone, $10 Internet, and how to lower your utilities so you can take at least some of the load off your back.

Have you done everything in your power to lessen pandemic’s negative impact on your family? You probably have by doing things like:
<ul>
 	<li>Looking for a new job.</li>
 	<li>Trying to find a second job.</li>
 	<li>Working a side gig.</li>
 	<li>Selling some of your stuff.</li>
 	<li>Cutting costs from your budget.</li>
 	<li>Applying for government assistance.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

To help you in your quest to cut costs, here are some tips to lower some of your monthly bills that you can try today:
<h4>1. Get a free phone and pay less per month.</h4>
How much of your hard-earned money is going towards your cell phone and landline bills? The answer is that it’s probably more money than you’d like.

To pay less for your phone bills, try the Lifeline program from the FCC. Not only can it lower those monthly costs, but it can also give you a free phone if you qualify.
<h4>2. Don’t pay more than $10 for Internet.</h4>
What do you use the Internet for nowadays? Before COVID-19, you probably used it for entertainment purposes and to stay in touch with loved ones. Now, you may have to use the Internet to:
<ul>
 	<li>Work from home.</li>
 	<li>Connect your kids to their virtual classes.</li>
 	<li>Attend telemedicine appointments.</li>
 	<li>Shop online so you can stay safe.</li>
 	<li>And so on.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

The Internet is a must in this pandemic world, and since you can’t get rid of that cost altogether, you should at least try to pay less via one of the following: EveryoneOn, Comcast Internet Essentials, Access from AT&amp;T, Verizon Lifeline, and Mediacom Connect 2 Compete.

What do all of those Internet services have in common? They offer extremely affordable connections that are as low as $9.95 per month. Even better, many of those services won’t charge you installation or equipment fees, and they don’t require credit checks or contracts.
<h4>3. Get government assistance with your electricity bill.</h4>
Whether it’s the chilly winter or the upcoming scorching summer, your cooling or heating costs will contribute to a higher electricity bill. If that bill gets too high, you could break your budget and have to scramble for extra cash to pay all of your bills.

To lower your electricity bill, apply for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). It can help with your heating and cooling costs that make up a huge portion of your bill.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Try to negotiate a lower bill.</h4>
Whether it’s your phone, Internet, electric bill, or something else, almost everything can be negotiated to a lower price during the pandemic. How can you find out? By contacting your provider and telling them the issues you’re having with paying your bills.

Even if you don’t get a lower monthly payment, you should at least be given options to make your bills more manageable until we get back to the new normal. This can include payment plans, delayed payments, one-time discounts, and more.
<h4>5. Call 211.</h4>
If you’re finding your finances to be so frustrating that you don’t know what to do, call 211 now.

Have you always had a kitchen full of food, only to have things change once the coronavirus came around? If so, you’re not the only one with this issue, as the job loss created by the pandemic has made many wonder where their next meal will come from.

Since food is so essential, this isn’t a problem you can put on the backburner. You need to address it now before health problems kick in due to starvation and deprivation, and here are the resources that will help you do just that:

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>If You Need Food Right Now:</h3>
What constitutes needing food “right now”? An empty refrigerator and a growling stomach. In other words, needing emergency food assistance because your food has entirely run out, and you don’t have money to buy more because you lost your job and have no savings.

Many families have found themselves in this situation after the breadwinner lost their job due to the coronavirus shutdowns. And while we did have COVID-19 stimulus payments in the past to give your bank account a bit of a boost, it wasn’t enough money to last very long.

How can you get emergency food assistance, so you don’t have to wait to be fed? You can begin by calling 211, so you can speak to a local operator. Let them know just how dire your nutrition situation is, so they can tell you where to find local food banks and other resources that can feed your family immediately.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

After you make the call to 211, make another call to your state agency. Since they’re in charge of administering major food programs, they’ll know exactly what you need to do to start applying for long-term food assistance. Find your state agency by <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/contacts"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">going here</a>.

<h3>If You Need Food in the Future:</h3>
A call to 211 can help you with short-term food assistance, so you don’t fall victim to starvation during the pandemic. A subsequent call to your state agency can help as well. Either of those calls may lead you to eventually apply to some of these food assistance programs that can give you longer-term nutrition solutions, so you don’t end up hungry again:

<h4>Food Stamps (SNAP)</h4>
This program needs no introduction, as it’s been around for a while and is extremely popular amongst low-income families. If you qualify for SNAP benefits, you’ll get an EBT card you can use to buy essentials at the grocery store.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>WIC</h4>
If you’re pregnant or have young children, this program can help you buy nutritious food. As a WIC recipient, you won’t have to worry about paying out of pocket for baby food, formula, milk, eggs, cereal, fruits, and vegetables.

<h4>School Breakfast Program/National School Lunch Program</h4>
School-age children from low-income families can get breakfast as well as free or reduced-price lunch through these programs.

While those aren’t the only food assistance programs out there, they’re an excellent place to start. Apply for as many as you can so you never have to face starvation again.","If you’re having problems affording food due to the pandemic, here are some food resources that can help your family get the nutrition it needs.","2021-04-01 18:58:39",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/let-these-food-resources-keep-your-family-fed-now-and-in-the-future/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_667261060.jpg,shutterstock_667261060.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_667261060.jpg,3763,shutterstock_667261060,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_667261060.jpg,"Covid Relief","Covid Relief",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,let-these-food-resources-keep-your-family-fed-now-and-in-the-future,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-06 16:34:12"
3773,"Homeless Hotel Vouchers: Everything You Need To Know","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

When you’re homeless, you may feel as if you’re all alone and nobody cares about your housing situation. That’s not true, however, as you can move into a homeless shelter to put a roof over your head and possibly get help with food, healthcare, and more. But you also have another housing option, which is to get a hotel or motel voucher for the homeless. Here are some details on vouchers you should know before you start searching for one.
<h4>The Purpose of Hotel Vouchers</h4>
A hotel voucher is meant to help a homeless person sleep in a safer, cleaner, and more private place than a shelter. It achieves this goal by paying for a hotel or motel room so that the homeless can experience that lodging despite a lack of money.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Hotel Vouchers as a Temporary Housing Solution</h4>
A homeless hotel or motel voucher usually offers the recipient a very short stay. On average, that stay equals a maximum of three nights. For this reason, you should look at homeless vouchers as a very quick fix and not a source of housing stability.
<h4>Homeless Hotel Voucher Availability</h4>
As you would expect, homeless hotel vouchers are limited. Many homeless people would love to have the chance to stay in a hotel or motel, but it’s not possible due to the costs involved. Agencies must hold fundraisers to afford vouchers, so those efforts limit their availability.

Homeless vouchers may increase during summer or winter months featuring extreme weather. This is to ensure the homeless do not fall sick by living on the streets in harsh conditions.

It’s worth noting that you will have to stay in a hotel or motel chosen by the agency due to the costs. You probably will not get to pick your own. Also, motel vouchers are more common than hotel vouchers since they are less expensive.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Eligibility for Motel Vouchers</h4>
Motel voucher eligibility varies according to location and agency. You can gain priority over others if you are homeless due to a disaster like a flood or a hurricane. If you are a domestic violence victim, that may work in your favor as well.

Some agencies offer vouchers to specific groups as a way to filter out applicants. For example, you may get a hotel voucher if you’re a single parent, senior, single male, or disabled.
<h4>Motel Voucher Rules</h4>
If you are awarded a motel voucher, you will probably have to follow specific rules to keep it. You may need to meet with a counselor to plan how you’ll escape homelessness. You may need to check in with the agency and show you’re employed or looking for a job as well.

<h4>Online Tutor</h4>
Education is shifting online more and more each day. And while some of that can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convenience of online education makes it seem like it’ll be here to stay.

For online education to work, you need tutors. And since there are so many subjects and so many students worldwide, the demand for online tutors is high.

You could teach English to students across the globe. Or you could teach math to young kids in your own backyard. Regardless, if you’re interested in teaching online and getting paid for it, you could make around $10 to $15 per hour, which could grow to $20 with experience.

Getting hired as an online tutor usually involves a video interview. Here are some sites that may help you get started in this work-at-home field:

Even if you don’t know what President Biden’s American Rescue Plan entails, you’ve probably been reaping its rewards as of late. Why? Because after it was approved and made into law in March, the plan resulted in school reopenings, stimulus payments of $1,400, and rapid vaccine rollouts to keep us protected from the coronavirus.

While the American Rescue Plan continues to do what its name suggests, Biden has some more assistance up his sleeve. The President recently announced the details of his American Families Plan.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

As you can guess, it focuses on helping children and families stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. How? By lowering health insurance costs, helping with basic everyday expenses, improving nutrition, and more. And while all of those areas are essential, the American Families Plan’s educational goals may be its top highlight.
<h4>Education Issues the American Families Plan Hopes to Solve</h4>
Students of all ages could use a helping hand when it comes to advancing their learning. That’s why the American Families Plan tackles educational issues for children as young as three up to college students and workers looking to improve their marketable skills.

Here’s a closer look at the educational benefits the American Families Plan could provide if it gets signed into law.
<h4>$200 Billion to Provide Free Pre-School</h4>
The American Families Plan’s educational benefits begin at a very early age. If approved, it would offer complimentary pre-school for three and four-year-olds. This would help lower-income households where parents cannot afford to send their kids to pre-school like their higher-income counterparts. And it could help the average family save a whopping $13,000 per year in childcare expenses.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Those looking to work as early childhood educators would benefit as well. To incentivize early childhood education, interested students would receive free community college. They would then receive on-the-job training to advance their career, plus competitive wages.
<h4>$109 Billion for Free Community College</h4>
Fewer people are enrolling in college, and it’s not because they don’t want to improve their education and future. Instead, they’re skipping college due to costs.

The American Families Plan would kickstart enrollment by offering free community college. Workers looking to earn a credential and first-time students aiming to get their degree could do so at no cost. DREAMers would be included too. In all, free community college could put 5.5 million people through school.
<h4>Improved Pell Grant Benefits</h4>
While free community college could help low-income students achieve their dreams of getting a degree, increased Pell Grants could do the same. As the costs of college increase, the effectiveness of Pell Grants has decreased. The American Families Plan would boost Pell Grant benefits by $1,400.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Although that amount may not seem like a lot, every bit helps when it comes to paying for college. And as with no-cost community college, DREAMers could also qualify for these Pell Grant benefits.","Are free pre-school and college in the works?

3794,"8 Ways The American Families Plan Could Impact Your Life","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>1. Your taxes could drop.</h4>
The American Families Plan hopes to increase financial security for families and trigger economic growth by reducing middle-class taxes.

The Child Tax Credit from the American Rescue Plan would be extended through 2025. This would give you a credit of $3,600 for each child under six and $3,000 for each child older than six.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

In addition, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit increase from the American Rescue Plan would become permanent. This would give you a tax credit equal to half of your child care spending for any kids under 13 that maxes out at $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children.

Are you a childless worker? The American Families Plan would make the Earned Income Tax Credit permanent, which would be a massive help to low-wage workers.
<h4>2. Child care could be cheaper.</h4>
Free preschool would be great news for parents of young children, but what about child care? It would still be an issue for kids of other ages, which is why the American Families Plan aims to make child care more affordable.

The most vulnerable households could get free child care. Other households, meanwhile, would pay for child care based on a sliding income scale.
<h4>3. Your kids could enjoy free preschool.</h4>
Speaking of education, kids who can’t get a headstart on theirs when young usually feel the adverse effects later on in life. The American Families Plan would tackle this problem by offering free preschool for children ages three and four.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>4. Community college could be free.</h4>
Do you have thousands of dollars sitting in your savings so you can pay for college? Probably not, but you may not need such savings soon. Why? Because the American Families Plan would offer community college at no cost so you could get your degree or certification without breaking the bank.

This move would obviously help so many people who dream of going to college but don’t have the funds to do so. And it would also prevent more people from going into debt via student loans.
<h4>5. You could get more money for college.</h4>
While community college would be free under the American Families Plan, what if you want to continue your studies at a four-year school? That can cost quite the pretty penny, but Biden’s plan would help with an extra $1,400 added on top of the maximum Pell Grant award.
<h4>6. Your kids could stay fed over the summer.</h4>
When the coronavirus pandemic hit, you may have wondered how you would replace your children’s free or reduced-price meals. The Summer Pandemic-EBT program took care of that worry by offering funds to buy food while schools were closed. If the American Families Plan gets signed into law, Summer Pandemic-EBT would be permanent.
<h4>7. You could enjoy paid family and medical leave.</h4>
President Biden wants to create a paid family and medical leave program on a national scale. With it, you could get up to twelve weeks of paid leave, equaling a max of $4,000 per month. Should the American Families Plan be enacted, the leave program would help workers earning the lowest wages most, especially since 95 percent do not have paid family leave and 91 percent lack paid medical leave.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. Health insurance could be cheaper.</h4>
Do you buy your own health insurance? If so, the American Rescue Plan lowered your insurance premiums for two years. And with the American Families Plan, those reductions would become permanent, so you could enjoy those savings well into the future.","Should President Biden’s American Families Plan get approved, it could impact your life in several ways.

3798,"How To Use Your SNAP EBT Card","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, can help you put food on the table when times get tough. Unlike in the past, though, you won’t be receiving food stamps in the mail you can use at the grocery store. Instead, you’ll receive your SNAP benefits electronically to an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card.

SNAP benefits are loaded onto your EBT card monthly. And while you’ll receive help with setting up your EBT account once your card arrives, here’s a closer look at how it functions.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Where to Use Your EBT Card</h4>
If you’ve ever swiped a debit or credit card at the grocery store, an EBT card functions similarly. To play it safe, look at the store entrance to see if it has a sign saying it accepts EBT payments. Luckily, many stores now participate in this program, such as grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations, and even some farmers' markets if you’re looking for healthier foods.

Beyond those stores, you may be able to use your EBT card at places like Walgreens, CVS, Target, and Walmart. Again, you’ll want to check before shopping, so you don’t have any issues at checkout.

While EBT cards come in handy for in-person purchases, many states now allow you to use them to make online purchases. This is particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic if you want to shop safely from the comfort of your home without worrying about getting sick. To confirm if your state allows online purchases with EBT cards, contact your local SNAP office once you receive your card.
<h4>What You Can Buy With Your SNAP EBT Card</h4>
You can buy many items with your SNAP EBT card. The program is meant to help supplement families’ nutrition, so most items will be necessities to keep your family fed.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Here’s a list of what can be purchased using your SNAP EBT card:
<ul>
 	<li>Meat</li>
 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Fish</li>
 	<li>Dairy products</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Cereal</li>
 	<li>Pasta</li>
 	<li>Bread</li>
 	<li>Rice</li>
 	<li>Non-alcoholic beverages</li>
 	<li>Snacks</li>
 	<li>Desserts</li>
 	<li>Seeds/plants that can be used to grow your own produce</li>
 	<li>Spices</li>
 	<li>Flavor extracts</li>
 	<li>Oils</li>
 	<li>Fats</li>
 	<li>Condiments</li>
</ul>
<h4>What You Cannot Buy With Your SNAP EBT Card</h4>
Once again, SNAP is meant to help you purchase nutrition-related necessities for your household. As such, you cannot use your EBT card loaded with SNAP benefits to purchase any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Alcoholic beverages</li>
 	<li>Tobacco products</li>
 	<li>Cleaning supplies</li>
 	<li>Health/beauty products</li>
 	<li>Household supplies</li>
 	<li>Vitamins</li>
 	<li>Supplements</li>
 	<li>Medication</li>
 	<li>Hot or prepared foods that are ready for consumption</li>
 	<li>Live animals</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>SNAP Replaces Damaged Food</h4>
If your area experiences a power outage or a disaster that causes your food to spoil, SNAP will replace that food, so you don’t waste any benefits. To replace the spoiled food, you’ll need to file a claim within 10 days of the incident.
<h4>Replacing a Lost or Stolen SNAP EBT Card</h4>
If you lose your SNAP EBT card or it gets stolen, contact your local SNAP office immediately. Since it can take seven days to get a replacement card, don’t delay.","If you get approved for food stamps, you’ll receive an EBT card.

3801,"You Need To Apply For Pandemic Eviction Protection. Here’s How","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Many had trouble paying the rent before the coronavirus hit. But once shutdowns and stay-at-home orders were enacted, paying rent became impossible due to job loss. That’s where the CDC Eviction Moratorium saved the day, as it helped people stay in their homes despite a lack of income.

There are some major misconceptions when it comes to the eviction moratorium, though. We’ll discuss what they are and what you must do to ensure you are protected from being kicked out of your home.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Purpose of the CDC Eviction Moratorium</h4>
Once the coronavirus appeared, government officials stressed social distancing and staying at home. Doing so would help slow the spread of the virus so hospitals wouldn’t get overwhelmed with patients.

As businesses faced restrictions, many had to close. And as they closed, they led to job loss that saw people’s incomes drop drastically.

Without the eviction moratorium, many families would be forced to relocate. And if they relocated to a new home, a homeless shelter, with family and friends, or onto the streets, that would have triggered more infections.

The CDC Eviction Moratorium prevented those infections by allowing families to stay where they are. But beyond the health benefits, it also gave families some breathing room to fix their finances.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>What the CDC Eviction Moratorium Does</h4>
With the moratorium in place, eligible families cannot be evicted due to nonpayment of rent. They can be evicted for not abiding by rules in the lease, however. So, while your landlord won’t evict you (if eligible) for not making those rent payments, they can remove you from the property if you use it to conduct criminal activity.

Although you won’t be kicked out for not paying your rent, that doesn’t mean your rent is waived. Once the moratorium expires, all back rent will be due, as well as any fees and interest. In other words, you could be looking at a massive payment to your landlord in a few months if you haven’t been keeping up with the rent.

Since rent is not waived, it’s essential to save money, cut your expenses, and plan how you’ll make that payment when the moratorium ends on June 30, 2021.
<h4>How to Prevent Eviction With the CDC Moratorium</h4>
Besides rent being waived, another misconception is that everyone is automatically eligible for the eviction moratorium. That’s not the case, as you will have to apply to prove your eligibility.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Applying is simple, as you and anyone else on your lease must <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">complete this form</a> and submit it to the person who has the power to evict you. That could be the property manager, property owner, or landlord.

As you’ll see on the form, eligibility for the eviction moratorium is straightforward and not too complicated. For instance, receiving government assistance and losing income due to the coronavirus pandemic makes you eligible. To see all of the eligibility requirements, consult the form.","The COVID-19 pandemic has made many fear eviction.

People sometimes “fast” so they can get their appetite under control and lose weight. During that fast, they don’t eat food.

You can use the same concept when it comes to money to get your spending out of control and <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/want-help-with-decreasing-your-debt-here-it-is/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">avoid debt</a>. And during your “financial fast,” you won’t spend money.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

While there are several ways to do financial fasts, let’s discuss one that’s 21 days long.
<h4>What Is the 21-Day Financial Fast?</h4>
The 21-Day financial fast is a challenge you can put yourself through now to curtail bad spending habits that can put you in deep debt for the long term. Here are the basic rules:
<h5>1. Purchase necessities only.</h5>
For 21 days, you will be cutting out luxuries, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Eating out.</li>
 	<li>Going to the movies.</li>
 	<li>Making online purchases.</li>
 	<li>Buying birthday gifts.</li>
 	<li>Taking vacations.</li>
 	<li>Going to the hair salon.</li>
 	<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>
In short, if you don’t 100 percent need it to survive, you don’t buy it.

What do you need to survive? Things like housing, food, utilities, transportation, and medication.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h5>2. Use cash only.</h5>
One easy way to control spending is to stick to cash. Doing so leads to a feeling of actual separation and loss when you pay with dollars versus a card.

On the flip side, not spending and keeping that cash in your wallet can lead to feelings of happiness and pride over showing self-restraint.
<h5>3. Keep a journal.</h5>
Documenting your 21-day journey is key to pinpointing your spending issues. Write down anything you’re feeling during your fast in terms of money.

For instance, if you find an urge to splurge on luxuries, write it down. Also, document all of your expenditures.
<h5>4. Do it for 21 days.</h5>
It’s called the 21-day financial fast for a reason. It lasts 21 days, not 10, and you’ll need to commit to the full three weeks to reap all the rewards of this challenge.

Could you do the fast for longer than 21 days? Yes, but doing so may become too difficult to the point that it leads to stress.

21 days is the perfect amount of time to fast – no more and no less.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Benefits of the 21-Day Financial Fast</h4>
To complete this challenge successfully, you’ll need a good reason why you’re doing it. Here are some benefits that can help you pick out that reason, so you stick to the challenge for the full duration.
<ul>
 	<li>You can start saving immediately – By only using cash and sticking to necessities, you can stop the financial bleeding that may have occurred from out of control spending.</li>
 	<li>You can limit debt – Since only cash is being used, you can keep your debt down so you can pay it down instead of letting it spiral out of control.</li>
 	<li>You can get a clearer picture of your spending issues – 21 days without luxuries or credit cards could lead to significant savings. As you look through your journal, you can see what you genuinely need to buy and what isn’t so necessary.</li>

Keep reading to see how to keep your money and information secure when seeking a housing voucher.

While the Internet is certainly convenient, it’s also filled with con artists looking to score easy money at your expense.

What do they often target? People in need who may feel a bit rushed or desperate for a service, which may describe you if you are frantically seeking <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/need-a-legit-work-from-home-job-try-these-3/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ways to keep a roof over your family’s head</a>.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

The U.S. Department of Housing And Urban Development (HUD) created its Housing Choice Voucher program (previously Section 8) to give low-income families a boost with the rent. And while you can kickstart the Section 8 application process online, there are certain things you should be aware of to protect yourself from common scams.

Let’s clear the air on what is okay and what’s not acceptable when it comes to Section 8, especially in terms of payments for services that should be free.
<h4>1. Is there a cost to apply for Section 8?</h4>
No. In fact, the HUD prohibits the charging of any fees during the application process.

This makes perfect sense since the program is meant to help families trying to keep their heads above water, so you shouldn’t have to pay a penny to apply.

Whenever you get led to a payment screen when seeking Section 8 information, leave immediately. You should never have to pay for information or an application.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>2. Can you apply for a Section 8 housing voucher online?</h4>
In some instances, yes, you can apply online. Your best bet may be to apply in person with your Public Housing Agency (PHA), however, so you can get help with filling out the application and keep your data secure.

Either way, find your local PHA here and contact them to see your options and set up an appointment. Do this first before entering your information into any online application.

Some sites may trick you into thinking you’re applying for Section 8 when you are not. After you enter your data, they’ll sell it to marketing companies who will hound you with other offers.

For this reason alone, it’s best to get to know your PHA now before making any moves that could compromise your information.
<h4>3. Can you pay for someone else’s voucher?</h4>
Never underestimate the creativity of scammers. Some will offer vouchers online in exchange for money.

Why would they do this? Because they know that Section 8 vouchers have notoriously long waiting lists that could last years, even after you’re approved.

If a person is extremely anxious to get their voucher and get off the waiting list, they may be willing to fork over cash for a fake voucher.

You cannot buy someone else’s voucher, so don’t bother. You also cannot pay or bribe anyone to move up on the waiting list.

<h4>4. Do you have to pay to view Section 8 properties?</h4>
Viewing a property should be free, as should getting any pertinent information on it. Be sure to see the landlord in person so you can view the property and get informed.

Never send them payment for services that a legitimate landlord would do at no cost.
<h4>5. Can you pay to reserve a Section 8 property?</h4>
Here’s another common scam that takes advantage of Section 8 “scarcity.” If a landlord asks for payment to reserve their Section 8 rental, do not do it.

You will often see this and similar deposit scams on online classified sites for rentals that do not even exist.","You may feel so stressed in your search for Section 8 rental assistance that you become blind to scammers.

While <a href=""https://hardshiprecovery.com/need-housing-you-can-afford-this-tool-can-help/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting evicted from your home</a> is one of the worst things that can happen when money runs low, having your lights cut off isn’t much better. You could call your utility company to try to negotiate a smaller or postponed payment, but what if they refuse after too many requests? If this is the case, you’ll want to look elsewhere for help, and here are some of your options:
<h4>Call 211</h4>
Dialing this number on your phone can help when you require emergency assistance. For instance, if your electricity was or is about to be cut off, calling 211 can connect you with a local operator that knows of assistance programs in your area.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

It’s worth noting that 211 doesn’t just help with essential bills. Should you have problems in other areas, they can help with housing, food, healthcare, and more. Keep this in mind if and when you call.

You can also visit <a href=""https://www.211.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">211’s website</a> here to learn more about their services.
<h4>Contact a LIHEAP Office</h4>
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) may not pay all of your electric bill, but it can help with a significant portion of it that’s related to heating and cooling. If you can’t keep up with surging electric bills in the summer and winter months, LIHEAP can step in to give you that financial aid you need.

Qualifying for LIHEAP differs according to location, but if your household gross income does not exceed 150 percent of the federal poverty level, you should be good to go. You can also qualify if you receive some form of government benefits already, such as TANF, SNAP, or SSI.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

LIHEAP may not give you monthly assistance, as it’s intended to act as occasional help with paying a portion of your energy bill. Still, it’s good to know that you have an option here that could give you a boost when you need it.

Applying for LIHEAP occurs locally, although you may be able to fill out an application online. To find out how this program works in your area, <a href=""https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/db/index.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">go here</a> to find your local office.
<h4>Find Other Forms of Utility Assistance Near You</h4>
<a href=""https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/profiles/energyhelp.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">This link from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> is handy for finding low-income energy assistance. Find your state in the drop-down menu, and you’ll be taken to a page with all of the energy programs at your disposal. Some, like LIHEAP, will be federal. Others will come from the state, utility companies, or local charities.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Hopefully, your state is loaded with low-income energy programs that can help you. If it’s anything like Florida, you should be good to go, as some programs offer free home improvements to improve energy efficiency, while others provide health with monthly bills.

If you’ve noticed you’re having issues with paying your energy bill on time, start looking at your options now before it’s too late. Many of these programs have limited funds and tend to work on a first-come, first-served basis.","You won’t have to live in fear of having your electricity shut off if you use one of these methods to get help with paying your energy bill.","2021-08-01 04:55:55",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/keep-your-lights-on-by-getting-financial-assistance-with-your-electric-bill/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_289649816.png,shutterstock_289649816.png,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_289649816.png,3821,shutterstock_289649816,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_289649816.png,"Benefits Assistance","Savings And Loans",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,keep-your-lights-on-by-getting-financial-assistance-with-your-electric-bill,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-25 19:07:08"
3838,"Is A $6,495 Pell Grant Your Best Bet To Pay For College?","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>What is a Pell Grant?</h4>
A Pell Grant is a form of financial aid that comes from the federal government.
<h4>How much is a Pell Grant worth?</h4>
The maximum Pell Grant award equals $6,495 per year, which can undoubtedly make your cost of getting a degree much more affordable.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What’s the difference between a Pell Grant and a student loan?</h4>
Many people looking to go to college immediately apply for student loans. This could be due to the fact that loans are so well-known, or the student doesn’t think they have the grades or resume to qualify for scholarships.

Lesser-known grants may be the best form of financial aid around, however. Not only do they skip the merit-based path that competitive scholarships take, but they do not have to be repaid like student loans. In other words, if you qualify for a Pell Grant, you won’t have to worry about making any payments in the future, which can help you focus on your studies.
<h4>Does a Pell Grant only pay tuition?</h4>
Besides its hefty $6,495 sum, the Pell Grant’s most attractive feature may be its flexibility.
Unlike other forms of student financial aid that may be restrictive, you can use Pell Grant funds to pay for a vast range of expenses.

This is excellent news for someone who may have children, as you can use a Pell Grant to pay for child care.
Likewise, you can use it to pay for dependent care. And if those aren’t costs you have to worry about, you can always use your Pell Grant cash to cover as much of your tuition, housing, or books as possible.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Do you have to go to a four-year school?</h4>
Here’s another area where a Pell Grant's flexibility shines. Sure, you can use your Pell Grant to get your degree at a traditional four-year school. But you can also use it to go to an online school or a career school, provided that it’s accredited. And if you’re taking the community college route to start, that won’t be an issue either, as Pell Grants work there.
<h4>Is there an age limit for Pell Grants?</h4>
No, which may be surprising news that adults looking to go back to school will love to hear. There is no age limit when applying for a Pell Grant, so you don’t have to be fresh out of high school or in your 20s to do so.
<h4>Does your credit score matter?</h4>
Your credit score will not be checked when applying for a Pell Grant, as it is not a loan. And while we’re at it, your grades will not matter either since Pell Grants are need-based and not merit-based. So, if you feel like your past could hinder your Pell Grant eligibility, don’t.
<h4>What does matter when applying for a Pell Grant?</h4>
Your eligibility for a Pell Grant will depend on several factors. Your financial need sits atop the list, followed by your student status (part or full-time), your school’s acceptance by the Department of Education, how much your school costs, any degrees you have, etc.

3841,"6 Freebies That Come With Being A College Student","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

What comes with being a college student besides fun and tons of study time? If you’re like most, it’s a limited budget.

Luckily, there are ways to stretch that budget via freebies, such as these:
<h4>Free Food</h4>
There’s always something happening on college campuses, and many times, it involves free food. <a href=""http://freefoodcampus.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Visit the Free Food on Campus site</a>, and you can see where to grab complimentary grub near you.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Just click on your state and select your university, and you can see where to feed yourself on campus without paying a penny.

Beyond that site, keep an eye out when you’re strolling around campus. You’re quite likely to find flyers advertising events that offer free food.

You could also come across people handing out goodies to promote their club or something similar.
<h4>Free Checking Account</h4>
The last thing you want to spend a portion of your budget on is banking fees. Banks in college towns know this, which is why some will offer free checking accounts to students.

If you don’t see any signs for free checking accounts in your town, pick up the phone and call your local credit union or bank. They may offer free accounts privately.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Free Tax Preparation</h4>
If you work during college and have an income, you’ll have to file taxes. Instead of paying a professional to help, you can use one of your fellow students for free.

Although this may not be available in every college town, some business students offer free tax prep as part of their coursework. Don’t worry about any mistakes, either, as professors will be checking the work to ensure it’s good to go.

To find out if your college offers free tax prep, contact its business school.
<h4>Free Microsoft Office and Other Software</h4>
Regardless of your major, you’ll probably have to write a paper or two to graduate. You’ll need software like Microsoft Office to do so, but as a student, you won’t have to pay a thing.

As long as you’re enrolled in school and have a valid email address from your university, <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/students/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">you can get Office 365 Education at no cost</a>.

Although not as popular as Office, being a student can also get you<a href=""https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> access to Autodesk’s suite</a> of a plethora of products that focus on design.

Last, but not least, you’ll want software to protect all of your personal information and passwords. LastPass <a href=""https://lastpass.com/edupromo.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">will give you that for six months at no cost</a> since you’re a student.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Free Amazon Prime</h4>
Provided you are enrolled in at least one college course and have a current .edu email address, you can get Amazon Prime and all of its perks for free.

The freebie lasts for six months, but if you want to continue after that, you’ll get a discounted student rate.

If you’re not familiar with Amazon Prime, it allows you to purchase tons of items online with free two-day shipping, plus the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Prime Video and its massive catalog of free streaming TV shows and movies.</li>
 	<li>Prime Reading and its vast selection of books.</li>
 	<li>Unlimited photo storage.</li>
 	<li>Amazon Music Unlimited’s 50 million songs for free.</li>
 	<li>Free student product samples in the mail.</li>
 	<li>Prime student deals that offer exclusive discounts.</li>
</ul>
Free Gym Membership

Your on-campus rec center probably has better facilities than most big-name gyms. Best of all, you should be able to use it for free since you’re a student.","Does being a student strapped for cash have you stressed?

3855,"Sick Of Predatory Payday Loans? Try This Cheaper Option","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

We’ll reveal a cheaper option that can give you the emergency financial assistance you need, even if you have bad credit. And as a bonus, it can help build your credit too.

Statistics show that over 12 million Americans have one thing in common every year: They rely on payday loans for quick cash. While their reasoning for getting a payday loan may be sound, such as having to pay a bill or car repair, here’s what isn’t good: The interest. With some interest rates hovering around 400 percent, you could say that getting a payday loan can lead to regret.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

So, with payday loans being too expensive, what are your other options? If friends and family cannot help or you don’t feel like asking them for the favor, you could try a Possible Finance installment loan. Here’s how it can give you the help you need without the exorbitant interest that comes with a payday loan.
<h3>The Benefits of Getting a $500 Installment Loan</h3>
Possible Finance is an online lender that provides small installment loans up to $500. Will that amount help you buy a car or house? Of course not, but it could help you pay some of your rent, pay a light bill, get your car repaired, or buy food if your refrigerator is empty.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

How does an installment loan compare to a payday loan? Very favorably when you consider the following:
<ol>
 	<li>You can apply for an installment loan by installing the Possible Finance app on your phone, making it incredibly convenient.</li>
 	<li>If approved, you can get up to $500 in just minutes, making it ideal for emergencies.</li>
 	<li>You won’t have to worry if you have no credit or bad credit. Possible Finance won’t check credit when you apply for one of their installment loans, unlike other lenders.</li>
 	<li>A payday loan will require payment from your next paycheck. Such pressure doesn’t exist with a Possible Finance loan, as you can pay in two weeks or extend that first payment to a month from now.</li>
 	<li>Possible Finance loans must be repaid within two months. This gives you plenty of time to get your finances in order and ensure you pay promptly.</li>
 	<li>Possible Finance will report your payments to the major credit bureaus. If you pay on time, such reporting will work in your favor, as it can boost your credit score.</li>
 	<li>By boosting your credit score, it will be easier to get more favorable loans in the future, as well as credit cards, renting apartments, getting a job, etc., as all are tied to your credit.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Should you apply for a $500 installment loan if you don’t really need the money or just want to build your credit? Not necessarily, as this is more of a last resort and alternative to incredibly costly payday loans. The installment loan will charge you interest which can be high, but not as high as a payday loan. As such, turn to Possible Finance when all of your other options are exhausted, because as shown, it can be helpful in certain situations. Just be sure to read all of the fine print to know what you’re getting into before signing off on the loan.","Just because you need cash in a pinch doesn’t mean you have to resort to a payday loan.","2021-08-01 04:54:55",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/sick-of-predatory-payday-loans-try-this-cheaper-option/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_598561409.jpg,shutterstock_598561409.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_598561409.jpg,3856,"Frustrated,Man,Calculating,Bills,And,Tax,Expenses",,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_598561409.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,sick-of-predatory-payday-loans-try-this-cheaper-option,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 13:57:02"
3858,"6 Ways Bad Credit Affects Your Health, And The $500 Loan That Builds It","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

We’ll show you why improving your credit is a must, and how a $500 loan can help you achieve that goal.
<h4>How Bad Credit Can Make Your Life More Difficult</h4>
Even though we’re entitled to one free credit report per year, many of us don’t even know our credit score. Why? Because we’ve made mistakes in the past, and we feel that the score may be so low that looking at it will trigger anxiety or depression.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Well, even though your credit score may be low, you should view your free credit report at least once a year. If not, you won’t know where you stand, which will keep you from improving credit that needs fixing. And here’s what bad credit can lead to:
<ol>
 	<li>Difficulty getting a new credit card.</li>
 	<li>Difficulty getting a loan to buy a car or home.</li>
 	<li>Not getting hired for a job, as some employers perform credit checks.</li>
 	<li>Not being able to rent an apartment.</li>
 	<li>Having to leave a deposit just to open up a new Internet or cell phone account.</li>
 	<li>Paying more for insurance.</li>
 	<li>Paying higher interest rates.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>How Bad Credit Impacts Your Health</h4>
That list above can make your life miserable in more ways than one. And over time, that bad credit can negatively impact your health in the following ways:
<ol>
 	<li>Anxiety – Not being able to get a loan or credit card could leave you in a bind in the event of a medical emergency. A 2020 study found that 79 percent of people felt anxious about the rising cost of healthcare, making it their top worry.</li>
 	<li>Fatigue – A 2020 study from Bankrate found that nearly half of adults had trouble sleeping due to financial issues, with 13 percent reporting poor sleep due to credit card debt. If you can’t sleep due to bad credit, you’ll be tired all the time.</li>
 	<li>Stress – A 2020 Credit Sesame report found that 82 percent felt stress solely due to their credit card debt.</li>
 	<li>Depression – 48 percent of debt-ridden adults said their poor credit status led to depression and pessimism in 2019.</li>
 	<li>Shame – A 2019 study revealed that 46 percent of people said they felt ashamed of their poor credit. Shame can lead to depression, anxiety, and isolation from others.</li>
 	<li>Anger – Credit Sesame found that in 2020, 30 percent of people with bad credit felt angry about it due to the following: 50 percent couldn’t get an auto loan, 28 percent couldn’t rent an apartment, 22 percent couldn’t get a cell phone, and 19 percent had to live with their parents.</li>
</ol>
What’s the scary part about that list? It could be even longer, which shows just how bad poor credit can be for your health and overall quality of life.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Build Your Credit With a $500 Loan</h4>
If you’re in a pinch, need cash fast, cannot get a loan from friends and family, and have bad credit, an installment loan from Possible Finance can help in the following ways:
<ol>
 	<li>You can get up to a $500 loan within minutes by applying through the Possible Finance app on your phone.</li>
 	<li>Bad credit or no credit won’t be an issue since this online lender will not check your credit.</li>
 	<li>You can take up to two months to pay the loan back.</li>
 	<li>As you pay the loan back, you will build your credit since those payments get reported to the three credit bureaus.</li>
</ol>
Can that loan build your credit all in one shot? Unfortunately, no, but as long as you pay it back on time, it can give your credit a boost so you can slowly start getting back where you need to be.","Bad credit can negatively impact your finances and, even worse, your health.","2021-08-01 04:52:55",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/6-ways-bad-credit-affects-your-health-and-the-500-loan-that-builds-it/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_789678214.jpg,shutterstock_789678214.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_789678214.jpg,3859,"Young,Women,Worried,About,Bills",,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_789678214.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,6-ways-bad-credit-affects-your-health-and-the-500-loan-that-builds-it,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 13:57:29"
3861,"Need More Room In Your Budget? Try These Tips","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

If so, here are some easy-to-implement tips to help get those costs under control without sacrificing much.
<h4>Spend $10 Less on Takeout</h4>
Whether it’s due to COVID-19 or convenience, many people are ordering takeout nowadays to feed their families. Doing so is a lot more expensive than cooking your own meals and isn’t advised if you’re looking to save, but you can do the following to make takeout less expensive: Call in your order.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

A survey of 2,000 restaurant customers found that picking up a phone can save $3 to $10 per order compared to going online. Why? Because if you use an app or website to order, it’s a lot easier to add impulse items due to upsells, pop-ups, and more. However, when talking on the phone, you usually have to be quick and already know what you want.
<h4>Avoid Payment Fees</h4>
Have you ever paid a bill over the phone? You may have in the past because you forgot about the bill until the last second, which forced you to make that call.

While talking to a customer service agent over the phone can help you pay a bill at the last minute, it can be costly. For example, Spectrum Cable will charge you $5 for making a payment over the phone using a live person, and Verizon Wireless will charge $7. Both are ridiculous amounts that you can avoid by paying in person, paying online, or using an automated service when using your phone. Whatever you do, don’t pay using someone. And if you do, ask if there’s a charge first.
<h4>Cut Your Amazon Costs</h4>
Have you been using Amazon a lot lately? You probably have, as the online giant is the shopping choice for many consumers due to its convenience and quick shipping. But the fact that Amazon is so convenient can be a budget-buster, especially if you use 1-click checkout.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

As its name suggests, 1-click lets you place an order with minimal effort. While this may be quick and painless if you’re in a rush, a study from Iowa State University found that those who avoid 1-click spend less on Amazon.

What’s the reason for less spending? Because when you have to move an item to your online shopping cart, it gives you time to reconsider the purchase. With 1-click, that critical step is skipped.

If you don’t think eliminating 1-click from your Amazon setup will make a difference, know this: Studies show that shoppers change their minds 70 percent of the time, so you probably will too.
<h4>Avoid Autopay</h4>
Setting up autopay can keep you from forgetting to pay bills on time, which can keep your credit score from tanking. But autopay comes with a downside: It can keep you from closely analyzing your bills.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

For instance, if you have your utility bill on autopay, you may not look at your usage. And if you fail to see that you’re using a ton of electricity, you won’t adjust your thermostat, take quicker showers, etc., to cut your monthly costs. In addition, you may be charged unjustly on particular bills, which will pass by undetected if autopay is live.

What’s the better option for paying bills? Instead of autopay, use the company’s website to make your payments manually or send in a check. By doing so, studies say you can save four to six percent on your bills, which can translate to up to $72 savings annually for a bill that’s $100 per month.","Are your monthly expenses mounting to the point that your budget is about to burst?","2021-08-01 04:51:18",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/need-more-room-in-your-budget-try-these-tips/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_254511226.png,shutterstock_254511226.png,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_254511226.png,3862,shutterstock_254511226,,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_254511226.png,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,need-more-room-in-your-budget-try-these-tips,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 13:57:37"
3886,"Felon-Friendly Apartments: Frequently Asked Questions","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

<h4>1. Can you get an apartment as a felon?</h4>
Yes, you certainly can. Will it be more complicated than renting as a person with a clean record? Probably, but it is doable if you start your search now using some of the knowledge in this guide.
<h4>2. Where can you start looking for felon-friendly apartments?</h4>
You can begin your housing search instantly by searching for felon-friendly apartments online. Your primary goal should be to search for places that don’t require background checks.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Such properties likely carry the following characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li>They sit outside of city centers.</li>
 	<li>You’ll be dealing with a private landlord instead of a large management company.</li>
 	<li>They do not exist in large apartment buildings where management companies are typically in charge.</li>
 	<li>They may be properties with lower demand, such as basements or single rooms in duplexes or single-family homes.</li>
</ul>
As for websites that list felony-friendly properties, you may find the most luck on Craigslist. Other options include Trovit, Zumper, Yelp, and Zillow.

When using any of these sites, try to find felon-friendly properties by searching for “no background check.”

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>3. Are there a lot of felon-friendly apartments online?</h4>
The answer to this depends on where you are located. Generally, however, there are not a ton of apartments that will advertise themselves as felon-friendly. That’s why searching for ones that do not require background checks is a must.

To expand your options, try looking for shared housing, sublets, or even temporary housing. You never know who may be willing to rent under such special circumstances.
<h4>4. Can you get Section 8 housing as a felon?</h4>
Believe it or not, you could qualify for Section 8 housing from the government, even if you have a felony. Qualifying for such housing assistance would be of great help, as a voucher makes rent much more affordable.

When it comes to most federal housing programs, two specific felonies can disqualify you from receiving benefits. The first is being listed as a lifetime sex offender. The second is having a conviction for producing methamphetamine in federal housing. Either conviction related to anyone in the household would disqualify you from Section 8.

Beyond those two disqualifications, the HUD may also prevent you from receiving Section 8 assistance if anyone on the application has convictions for:
<ul>
 	<li>Fraud</li>
 	<li>Violent crimes</li>
 	<li>Drug trafficking</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

A history of drug or alcohol abuse, defaulting on rent payments, and issues with neighbors or previous living situations, such as disturbing the peace, could also negatively impact your Section 9 eligibility.

To find out if you could be eligible for Section 8, it’s best to directly contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA).
<h4>5. What can improve your chances of getting an apartment as a felon?</h4>
You can increase the likelihood of a landlord accepting you by doing any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Saving up a few months of rent that you can offer upfront.</li>
 	<li>Getting a steady income through a job.</li>
 	<li>Volunteering to get reliable references or personal connections that can recommend you to certain landlords or living situations.</li>
 	<li>Rebuilding your credit.</li>
 	<li>Paying back rent/repairs to any landlords in eviction cases and getting that history removed from your credit report.</li>
 	<li>Being polite and well-dressed during an interview.</li>
 	<li>Being truthful about your past.</li>
 	<li>Stressing how much you have changed.</li>
 	<li>Bringing references from past employers or friends/family members.</li>

3889,"Section 8 Basics You Need To Know","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

If so, here are some basics you should know about how the program works.

What can a Housing Choice Voucher do for you? Make rent affordable by paying a portion of your monthly payment to the landlord. Once that’s established, you’ll find it much easier to save money, pay your other bills on time, and start building a solid financial future.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

To prep you for the Section 8 process before you apply for your voucher, here are some things to keep in mind:
<h4>Vouchers:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Your Housing Choice Voucher serves as an agreement between you and the Public Housing Agency (PHA).</li>
 	<li>When you sign the voucher, you agree to abide by Section 8 rules.</li>
 	<li>As long as you follow Section 8 rules, the PHA will help pay for part of your rent by giving it directly to your landlord each month.</li>
 	<li>To use your voucher, you will need to find a home that meets Section 8’s standards within a specified time limit.</li>
 	<li>You may apply for an extension of the time limit before the voucher expires if you’re having a hard time finding a suitable home.</li>
 	<li>Failure to find a home in time will lead to expiration and your voucher being given to someone else on the Section 8 waiting list.</li>
 	<li>If you lose your voucher due to not finding a home, you will have to re-apply when the waiting list reopens.</li>
 	<li>Since Section 8 waiting lists can last years due to high demand for vouchers, finding a home quickly is essential.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>Finding a Home:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Your voucher can be used according to your PHA’s rules. They will let you know the areas where it can be applied before searching for a home. You can transfer a Housing Choice Voucher to another location if you need to move. This can be done once your initial lease is fulfilled.</li>
 	<li>To transfer a voucher, you will have to be in good standing with the PHA and your landlord.</li>
 	<li>It may be possible to use your voucher where you currently live, if the home passes Section 8 inspection and meets affordability requirements. Such a situation is formally referred to as “leasing in place.”</li>
 	<li>A Section 8 voucher gives you the freedom to choose between various properties, such as townhomes, apartments, and single-family homes. You are not required to live in public housing.</li>
 	<li>Since you get to pick the property where you want to use your voucher, be sure that you can afford your portion of the rent. The property should be in good condition, in a safe neighborhood, near good schools, close to shopping and public transportation, etc.</li>
 	<li>You will likely have to complete an application with the landlord. They may charge you for this since screening applicants is an added expense.</li>
 	<li>If accepted by the landlord, don’t be surprised if they ask for a deposit. As with regular rental agreements, landlords require deposits to protect their properties. The deposit must be reasonable, however. They cannot charge you a higher deposit just because you are a Section 8 participant. You will have to pay the deposit out of your own pocket. If you cannot, you may seek Section 8 security deposit assistance.</li>
</ol>

3892,"The Easiest Way To Get A Section 8 Voucher Faster","[the_ad_group id=""19""]<!-- 100 Ad -->

Life would be a lot easier if your rent were cheaper. Not only could you get your landlord off your back, but you could also start paying down debt, handling other bills, or stashing cash for a rainy day.

What can make your rent cheaper? Besides moving somewhere remote or getting a roommate, a Section 8 voucher can cut those rent costs so you can keep more money in your pocket.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

Get a Section 8 voucher, and you’ll only be paying about 30 percent of your income to your landlord. But since a voucher makes rent so affordable, many people want to get one. And this high demand has led to long wait times that could last years.

Will your wait for a voucher last several years? That depends on several factors like voucher availability, where you want to live, and so on. You can reduce the delay by applying to several waiting lists, which increases your chances of getting a voucher quicker. You could also look for places where people may not want to live, as their voucher demand could be lower.

What’s another way to speed up the Section 8 process? Using preferences that give you priority over other voucher applicants.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

<h4>How Preferences Reduce Section 8 Wait Times</h4>
The government created the Section 8 program to provide housing assistance to those who need it most. As such, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) have come up with preferences to determine who has the greatest need.

The more preferences apply to your household, the better your chances of getting your voucher sooner. So, if any of the following apply, tell your PHA as quickly as possible. If you don’t, you could find yourself waiting a long time to get rental assistance:
<ul>
 	<li>Homelessness (not living with friends or family)</li>
 	<li>Living in a shelter</li>
 	<li>Veteran (must be honorably discharged)</li>
 	<li>Elderly (age 62 or older)</li>
 	<li>In the extremely low-income bracket (earn 30 percent of your area’s median income)</li>
 	<li>Have a disability (especially if where you’re living is making the disability worse)</li>
</ul>
You’ll have to provide documentation to prove those preferences, but it’s well worth putting in the time to report them, as they can move you up the Section 8 waitlist a lot faster than you thought.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Checking Your Voucher Status</h4>
Once you’re on the Section 8 waitlist, there are a couple of ways to check the status of your voucher. The first is to use the Waitlistcheck website. It’s a safe and secure site from the HUD that lets you see how you’re progressing on the waitlist. The second way to check your status is to call the PHA every couple of months. Ask them if you’re still on the list and if you’ve moved up at all.

Be sure to document any calls with the PHA, especially concerning your voucher status. Errors are not uncommon, so having documentation could save you a lot of hassle if you find you’ve been kicked off the waitlist by mistake.","Section 8 may not be the quick fix you need to pay the rent.

You may find it hard to meet your monthly budget, even if you’re not spending carelessly. For instance, you may not go out to eat and avoid shopping for clothes, yet you can barely keep your head above water.

What can help you stay afloat until you get your finances in order? The government. And while you may already know they can help with housing via Section 8, provide food assistance via SNAP, and so on, you may wonder if something similar exists for Internet service.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

The answer is yes; the government does offer free Wi-Fi. But you can’t get it just yet. Why? Because while they’ve announced the <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emergency Broadband Benefit program</a>, it’s not working at the moment.
<h4>What Is the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h4>
Announced in February 2021, the Emergency Broadband Benefit is a new program from the FCC. It was created in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which affected many families in two ways. First, the pandemic created record job loss, causing many families to lose significant income. Second, it caused kids to take classes online while schools closed and made many workers convert their homes into offices.

Less income and the need for the Internet led to the creation of the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which will offer eligible households the following once it goes live:
<ul>
 	<li>$50 to $75 each month towards the Internet bill.</li>
 	<li>$100 towards the purchase of a computer.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

To qualify for this free Internet program from the government, your household will need to meet one of the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>You qualify for a participating provider’s low-income Internet service.</li>
 	<li>You are eligible for a COVID-19 Internet program.</li>
 	<li>Your single income is less than $99,000, or your joint income is less than $198,000, and you experienced significant financial loss due to the coronavirus pandemic.</li>
 	<li>You qualify for the Lifeline program from the FCC, which requires that you make less than 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or receive public assistance.</li>
 	<li>You have a child that gets breakfasts or lunches from school at a reduced price or for free.</li>
 	<li>You have a student who, in this current award year, won a Federal Pell Grant.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Low-Cost Internet Programs</h4>
Since the Emergency Broadband Benefit is still in the works, here are some other low-cost Internet programs that may help you in the meantime:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.alticeadvantageinternet.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Access from AT&amp;TAltice Advantage Internet</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.internetessentials.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Comcast Internet Essentials</a></li>

 	<li><a href=""https://www.lifelinesupport.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lifeline</a></li>
 	<li>Spectrum Internet Assist</li>
</ul>
For most of those programs, eligibility is limited to households where someone receives an accepted form of public assistance, such as SNAP, SSI, the National School Lunch Program, etc.

You can get fast Internet speeds up to 50 Mbps, which should suffice for video chats, working from home, virtual classes, and the like. And while they may not be free, most of the programs offer service for just $9.95 per month.","If you’re struggling financially and need Internet access for work from home or study purposes, you may be wondering if the government offers free Wi-Fi.

Living on the streets can be stressful, unsanitary, and even dangerous. What’s your other option if you’re homeless? Living in a shelter, but that can be anything but ideal as well, especially if you have a family.

A shelter isn’t your only option besides the streets, though, as a voucher for a hotel or motel could help make your current homelessness much more tolerable. If you’ve never used a voucher before, here are places where you can find one so you can get that housing assistance you need as soon as possible.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Your Local Homeless Shelter</h4>
Just because you don’t want to stay in a homeless shelter doesn’t mean it can’t be of any help.
In fact, the homeless shelter staff probably know all of the resources that can help you get back on your feet, which includes vouchers.

Contact your local homeless shelter and tell them your situation. Explain that you don’t feel comfortable staying in the shelter, but you would like to know if they have any hotel vouchers. By asking that simple question, you could get pointed in the right direction.
<h4>Salvation Army</h4>
If you’ve always lived in a home or apartment of your own, you may have associated the Salvation Army with one thing: Those bell ringers in front of stores during the holidays.
Now, however, the Salvation Army could help you if you're homeless either through a shelter or by connecting you with a resource that offers motel vouchers.

Give them a call and ask if they know who offers motel vouchers for the homeless in your area.
<h4>Local Assistance Programs</h4>
Homelessness is a problem that affects every single state. As such, many places have their own assistance programs in place to help the homeless. Depending on your location, you may be able to find an assistance program that offers homeless hotel vouchers.

An Internet search can help you pinpoint such a program. Search for your city, county, or state, plus homeless assistance. Then contact whatever resource you find and ask for motel vouchers.

Have you ever dialed 211 on your phone? Those three digits can be a massive help if you’re homeless, as their local operators are experts in finding assistance for those who need it most.

Call 211 and let them know that you’re homeless and looking for motel vouchers. They should be able to tell you of any local contacts that offer vouchers.

When you think of negotiable things, the price of a car or house or even your salary probably come to mind. What about bills, though? Are they negotiable? Today, many of them are, and today we’ll focus on two of them that represent services you use daily: Internet and cell phone.

Before we jump into our tips for each service, know that most of the methods are interchangeable. In other words, some tips you use to lower your cell phone bill can be used to pay less for Internet, and vice versa.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>To Pay Less for Internet:</h4>
The Internet serves as the basis for so much nowadays that we can no longer live without it. You’ll need it to shop and stay in touch with others via social media. You may need it for work or to study. And if you have kids, they’ll need the Internet for schoolwork, especially with all of the current happenings worldwide.

Seeing that the Internet is so essential, your best move is to find ways to keep your service without paying a premium. You can begin by finding out which Internet service providers function in your area. Once you see that you have other options, you can use that as leverage when contacting your Internet company.

The goal is to speak with someone who can take action on your behalf. This may take several calls to customer service, or you may need to ask for a supervisor.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

To get the desired effect, let them know that you want to pay less each month without sacrificing speed or service. You can bring up instances where the Internet went out or was slow, and then state that you’re looking to cancel and change providers.

To retain you as a customer, the agent or supervisor will likely offer a discount since competition is so fierce nowadays.
<h4>To Pay Less for Your Cell Phone:</h4>
Like the Internet, the cell phone is a necessity in this day and age. No longer do we solely use cell phones for communication, as they can also help with shopping, work, entertainment, and more.

To trim your cell phone bill, analyze what’s on it. You may notice certain features you never use, which you can ask to be eliminated. The most important places to look involve your data, talk, and text. Are the offerings in your plan overkill? Get them reduced, so your bill becomes more affordable.

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

Other ways to negotiate a lower cell phone bill are to use autopay, which can drop your bill by a few bucks each month. Adding lines works well, too, especially if you have family members with separate plans. And if you have costly insurance covering your phone, get rid of it unless that device is incredibly expensive and new.

Lastly, take a look at prepaid carriers. They can give you similar service since they use the best networks around, while also lowering your bill and getting rid of any binding contracts.","Want to pay less for your Internet and cell phone without having to get rid of those services?

You know you want more money in your monthly budget. But you also know you don’t want a second job to get it, as your primary career already takes up way too much of your time.

And while starting your own business would be great, you may not have the upfront cash to do so. What does that leave you with? Side hustles that can lead to that desired extra income without the undesired time or money commitment.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Side Hustles Explained</h4>
Even if you’ve never had one before, you can probably figure out what a side hustle is by looking at its name. It’s just something you do on the side, with the hustle aspect referring to there being no limit to what you can make, as it all depends on your effort.

You may think that such a description wouldn’t lead to too much money. But again, you get out of that side hustle what you put into it. You may make an extra $100 every month to put a dent in some of your bills. Or, if you take things up a notch, you could pad your income with an extra $1,000 to help you pay down debt, build an emergency fund, or treat yourself.

Studies show that over 44 million people in the U.S. have at least one side hustle. They spend an average of 11 hours per week on it, earning around $25 per hour. That’s an extra $275 per week or $1,100 per month, which is a nice boost to anyone’s bank account.

With that out of the way, here are some side hustle examples that will show you it’s possible to make good extra money doing just about anything nowadays.
<h4>Become a Photo Scanner</h4>
Invest in a portable scanner, computer, and external hard drive, and you can have yourself a nice little side business that earns $1,000 per job. Doing what? Scanning people’s photos and putting them into digital form.

If you think nobody would want this service, think again. Just think of all the photos you have sitting in your home that you haven’t looked at in years due to the inconvenience. But if you had them on your phone or computer, you’d probably take frequent peeks or even share them with friends and family.

That’s why photo scanning is a great side hustle, as everyone has old-fashioned photos. What don’t they have? A scanner or the time and patience to scan and organize them.
Perform that service for friends and family to build your portfolio, then advertise your services online for as much as $1,000 per pop via TaskRabbit, Craigslist, and other sites.
<h4>Lend Your Backyard to Dogs</h4>
It may be hard to believe that this is a legit side hustle, so head over to Sniffspot.com and check it out for yourself.

You can make $1,000 per month renting out your backyard to dog sitters or dog walkers. Best of all, you don’t have to interact with the dogs or even be home to make that cash.
<h4>Become a Baby Gear Provider</h4>
BabyQuip.com hires “providers” to rent out their used baby supplies like cribs, strollers, etc., to families that travel.

You’ve probably heard the term “cutting the cord” quite frequently, and with good reason. Cable is costly, and if you have it, you probably don’t watch a majority of the channels in your lineup. Add to that the fact that streaming services like Netflix exist, and it’s no wonder why so many households are cutting the cord.

Although Netflix can be cheaper than cable, its popularity and the company’s desire to put out original content have led to higher prices. How can you cut those prices so Netflix fits into your budget? By trying these tips, some of which will result in Netflix at no cost.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Tips for Free Netflix</h3>
Before jumping into these tips, it’s worth noting that getting free Netflix is nowhere as easy as it used to be. In fact, Netflix stopped offering free trials for the streaming side of its service in 2020, so that’s no longer an option in the U.S., even if you’ve never used it before.
What are free options? Have a look:
<h4>Get 30 days of free DVD rentals</h4>
As mentioned, Netflix no longer offers free trials for its streaming service. However, it does have a DVD department, which is how the company got into the entertainment game and virtually destroyed Blockbuster Video.

You can try Netflix DVD rentals for one month at no cost, as that trial offer still exists. And while it may not be as convenient as streaming, you can get a better selection in terms of new releases. Even better, shipping is free, and you won’t have to worry about any late fees.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

The trick to get 30 days of free DVD rentals is to enter your payment information while remembering to cancel the trial before the month ends. If you forget to cancel, you’ll get charged for your first official month of rental service.
<h4>Use someone else’s login information</h4>
Perhaps the easiest way to get free Netflix streaming is to ask friends or family for one of their logins.
This works on certain Netflix plans that offer multiple screens of simultaneous streaming.

If you get a no when asking for a free login to use, offer to pay your share of the subscription. It’ll be a bit of money out of your pocket, but it will save you money on other forms of entertainment.
<h4>Look for free Netflix offers from cell phone and Internet providers</h4>
Have you heard of “Netflix on Us”? It’s an offer from T-Mobile where they give you free Netflix when you pick one of their cell phone plans.

Some companies are using Netflix as an incentive to sign up with them, so see which cell phone and Internet providers are participating so you can make the switch and enjoy your free streaming.

You may fear being evicted due to financial troubles caused by the pandemic. While times may seem tough right now, the good news is that there’s help on the way in the form of billions of dollars from the U.S. Department of Treasury.

Thanks to its Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program, many families can get the help they need to stay off the streets. Here are some basic things you should know about this program that seems to have many people confused.

[the_ad id=""209""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Who do you contact for emergency rental assistance?</h4>
There are three primary contacts to get help with paying your rent via the ERA program. The first you should contact is the most direct option, which is your state or local program. They have the funds from the U.S. Department of Treasury and are responsible for distributing them to those in need.

Believe it or not, there are 495 state and local programs with emergency rental assistance cash. This has caused issues with many wondering where to turn for help, but you can find your program by <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">visiting this link</a>.

Your second contact for getting emergency rental assistance is dialing 211 on your phone. Try this if you have issues finding your local program, or you simply want someone to walk you through the process.

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- 200 Ad -->

Your third emergency rental assistance contact is your local Public Housing Agency. This is a solid option if you want help in the short term, but you would also like to secure long-term housing via Section 8 or a similar program.
<h4>2. How can you tell if you qualify for rent assistance?</h4>
While the three contacts listed above will help you determine eligibility, here are some basic requirements that you should probably meet to get a piece of the ERA pie:
<ul>
 	<li>You have a rental agreement in place. Note that it does not have to be a signed lease, as long as there’s some agreement saying you owe rent.</li>
 	<li>You meet income requirements for your location. In other words, you can’t make more than a certain amount.</li>
 	<li>Someone in your home is experiencing housing instability and is worried about possibly being homeless.</li>
 	<li>Someone in your home has financial issues such as deep debt, lost income, or is eligible for unemployment.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3644""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Can you use emergency rental assistance to pay some of your bills?</h4>
Don’t let the name “rental assistance” fool you, as the ERA program can help with other bills as well. As long as it’s related to housing somehow, you could get help with paying that bill.

For example, you may have issues with paying your utility bills or even Internet. Or, you may have had to move due to nonpayment of rent, which caused you to incur application fees, screening fees, etc., for your new home. Those are all expenses that you may be able to receive assistance with under the ERA program.","Whether you don’t know emergency rental assistance exists, or you’re unsure if you qualify, keep reading, as we’ll do our best to clear things up for you.","2021-10-29 00:13:06",post,https://hardshiprecovery.com/confused-about-emergency-rental-assistance-read-this/,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1463201192.jpg,shutterstock_1463201192.jpg,/chroot/home/a5b36204/hardshiprecovery.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1463201192.jpg,3922,"Shocked,Worried,Young,Mixed,Race,Couple,Calculate,Bills,Pay,Online",,,,https://hardshiprecovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1463201192.jpg,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,2,bkelley,bkelley@hardshiprecovery.com,Brandon,Kelley,confused-about-emergency-rental-assistance-read-this,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-29 00:13:06"
