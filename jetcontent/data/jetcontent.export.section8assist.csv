60,"How to Get a Phone for Free from the Government","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LifeLine is an assistance program operated by the federal government of the United States with the goal of helping low-income families get a free cell phone and phone service. In this page, we offer information about how it works and the steps to follow to sign up.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This program is administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) and was created in 1985 to help low-income families improve their access to communications. It is one of several federal programs that belong to a system of telecommunication subsidies called the Universal Service Fund. Since its introduction, Lifeline has helped more than 15 million households get access to free cell phones.</span>

<strong>How to Qualify for LifeLine</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People need to meet certain requirements to get a free phone from the government through the Lifeline assistance program. Basically, they have to prove that they require financial assistance to enjoy the benefits of having a cell phone, such as the ability to find jobs, contact family members or handle emergencies. There are two possible avenues to become eligible for the program: by participating in a federal or state assistance program or due to household income.</span>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The majority of low-income families that qualify for a Lifeline account do so due to their participation in a federal or state assistance program. Most  providers consider that as proof enough of eligibility, and avoid the hassle of verifying financial need separately. However, they do require a card or award letter that confirms participation in the federal programs that are accepted as proof. Examples of valid programs are the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8), Veterans Pension and Survivor’s Benefit, and Medicaid. Families can contact their local Lifeline provider to request more information about the process.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Total household income can be used to qualify for a Lifeline account if no family member participates in a federal assistance program. All that is required is proof, through a pay stub or tax return, that the family’s income falls below 135%-175% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), depending on which state they live and which provider they choose.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As of 2018, $12,140 is the minimum income a single-person household must have to be above the poverty level in 48 states and the District of Columbia. This number goes up to $13,960 for Hawaii and $15,810 for Alaska. Additional family members increase this number accordingly. For example, a family of three that lives in Hawaii must earn less than $32,265 to qualify for a Lifeline account.</span>

<strong>How to Apply for a LifeLine account</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eligible families can request their Lifeline account by contacting one of the providers located in their state. To sign up for this assistance program, one family member has to provide proof of income or federal program participation, full legal name, date of birth, social security or tribal identification number, and address.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the household already has a phone contract with the provider, they can ask to receive the benefits through their existing account. Once they have signed up, members can choose which phone they would like to receive. Several carriers such as Assurance Wireless offer their customers access to Android-powered smartphones.</span>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are some restrictions that must be considered when requesting assistance through the Lifeline program. For example, only one wireless or landline Lifeline account is allowed per household. It is important for families to be aware of which service they need the most before signing up.</span>",,"2020-08-10 08:30:10",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-get-a-phone-for-free-from-the-government/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_476055898.jpg,shutterstock_476055898.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_476055898.jpg,62,shutterstock_476055898,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_476055898.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-get-a-phone-for-free-from-the-government,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:50:34"

In the United States, households can consider a wide array of alternative options to obtain money when the traditional methods, such as a bank loan or credit cards, cannot be used and their financial stability is threatened. 

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

In this guide, we offer information about where to find and how to get short-term money, and more.

<strong>Payday Loans</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A payday loan is the most readily accessible source of short-term money in America. It provides a set amount of money to be repaid with interest by the borrower after a short period, usually when the next payday comes. Most lending stores verify employment or income (through pay stubs or bank statements) before approving a loan to make sure the borrower can pay them back as agreed. However, some lenders skip this process altogether while others operate with different requirements.</span>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the United States, payday loans have been in use since the 1920s. However, they became a widely used financial instrument after the 1980s, when small community banks collapsed due to deregulation. Since then, lending stores have expanded nationwide to fill the void. As of 2018, short-term lending is a legal practice in most states, with thousands of stores across the country. At the federal level, payday lenders operate under the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).</span>

<strong>Applying for a Payday Loan</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first thing to do to prepare for a payday loan is to verify whether the state allows the practice altogether. People who live in Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Arizona, North Carolina, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia and the District of Columbia cannot request a payday loan due to it being illegal. However, there are other options that struggling families can rely on, some of which we’ll explore further ahead.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second step would be to find lenders willing to give the applicant the amount of money they require. These are usually located close to where the family lives, although online lenders have been rising in popularity. Regardless, most companies will charge a percentage or hard amount per each $100 they lend, which is then used to calculate the annual percentage rate (APR) given to the borrower before they agree to take the loan.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most lenders operate their own set of rules to determine who is eligible for a payday loan. However, they generally ask their potential customers to have an active bank, credit union or prepaid card account. Some lenders require documents that certify income from employment or any other source. People asking for a payday loan must provide a valid identification document that certifies they are at least 18 years old.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After a lender has been chosen, the final step is to determine how much money will be borrowed and when will it be paid back. Most payday loans don’t last longer than 14 days and their expiry date usually coincides with the borrower’s payday. In some states, lenders can offer the option to roll over the loan, which allows the borrower to extend the lending period if they are unable to repay in time.</span>

<strong>Other Alternatives</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Families living in states without payday loans have to rely on other options to acquire short-term money to cover their expenses. The best alternative to consider would be loans and other financing options from credit unions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To become a member of a credit union, most people are asked to donate a small amount of money to a non-profit organization. This is required to have access to several financing options that these unions operate to help their members cover all sorts of expenses. The Salary Advance Loan, which works like a payday loan but with lower interest rates, is a popular option among union members.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Credit unions offer financing options designed to cover certain expenses such as monthly rent or vehicle repairs. Some go as far as to offer low interest rate mortgage loans, credit cards and other forms of financial instruments.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A new financial instrument called the Small Dollar Loan (SDL) is another reliable method of obtaining short-term money. It was designed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) with the help of more than 30 state and local banks. These loans serve as a bridge between payday loans and standard bank loans by offering the borrower an annual interest rate (ART) of no more than 36 percent and a term of 90 days or more.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An auto loan would be the best option if a family needs the money to cover car repairs or to acquire a vehicle. There are many financial institutions around the country that offer affordable loans to their customers so that they repair their damaged vehicles or acquire the transportation method they need.</span>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<strong>Unclaimed Money</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many Americans are owed money and they don’t know about it. It may be due to tax refunds or back wages that were issued without the person being notified. In these cases, we’re talking about unclaimed money. Although the government does not operate a centralized location to find out if someone has unclaimed money, there are some state and agency specific resources that help figure out if this is the case.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People interested in getting back any unclaimed money they’re owed can make use of the local registries usually available in their state. Checking for tax refunds with the Internal Revenue System (IRS) or bank failures with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are good ways to start. Members of credit unions that have failed can search for unclaimed deposits, while people enrolled in Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits can look for unclaimed life insurance funds.</span>

<strong>Grants</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Grants are a great opportunity to get the money you need. They are a sum of money usually provided by the government or a non-profit organization to other organizations, businesses or individuals. Unlike typical loans, grants don’t have to be paid back, though those who are awarded a grant must comply with some directives and regulations.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether to pay for college education, kick start a business or perform much-needed maintenance to your home, grants can be the best solution if you meet the criteria to obtain one. There are hundreds of agencies and organizations that are willing to help families and individuals achieve their goals, giving away billions of dollars every year. </span>

70,"Affordable Options to Buy a Car","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A vehicle can be a powerful tool for low-income families, allowing them to get out of financial hardship. There are many alternatives across the United States that individuals can use to get help while buying a car.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They can apply for an auto loan and purchase their preferred vehicle, for example. In this guide, we provide information about financial assistance and alternatives to purchase an affordable car, as well as a set of suggestions for struggling families struggling to get the best possible vehicle.</span>

<strong>Auto Loans</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://section8assist.com/tips-for-finding-a-legitimate-loan-online/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Getting a loan from a bank</a> is the best way to purchase vehicles in the United States. Many low-income households usually decide that an auto loan is the best alternative they have. State and local financial institutions are always willing to provide affordable options to families that meet their lending standards. Several charities and non-profit organizations across the country also operate low-interest loans designed to be affordable for low-income families.</span>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Banks began to offer financial assistance to purchase vehicles at the beginning of the 20th century, when the auto industry was flourishing. A group of manufacturers, including General Motors, decided to offer financing options to dealers so that they could afford the large orders required to keep the factories going. In return, dealers gave the same opportunity to families wanting to buy a ca. With the help of the financial sector, they gave birth to what would later become the modern auto loan.</span>

<strong>Applying for an Auto Loan </strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Applying for an auto loan is similar to most other loan applications. Banks usually request that families provide documents that certify their eligibility for the loan, such as proof of income or employment. However, families often have to pay in advance a part of the value of the car they want to purchase. For example, a vehicle with a sale value of $10,000 would require a front payment of between $1,000 and $2,000 while the bank approves the loan for the remaining $8,000-$9,000.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This can be a problem for families with low income, poor credit or lack of employment. These factors can often turn an auto loan application into an uphill battle that many households refuse to fight as they struggle to save money. Some families even rely on federal programs to get the most out of their paychecks.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Breaking through these barriers can turn the tides and give families access to the vehicle they need. Exploring <a href=""http://section8assist.com/category/money/"">options to get short term money</a> can be helpful for applicants who want to pay incoming expenses, improve their credit score or open a savings account ahead of a successful loan application. These actions can put them on the road out of financial hardship, as well as getting them on better footing to cover the front payment required by the banks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Choosing the right car to be purchased is also as critical as having a stable source of income or a reliable job. Families should always consider how much money they can set aside for the monthly payments to make sure they don’t end up becoming a significant financial problem.</span>

<strong>Other Options</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An increasing amount of households in the United States find themselves in a position where asking for a auto loan is not an option. Many rely on federal assistance programs like SNAP to cover their food expenses and Medicaid to reduce the cost of their health insurance. Their very-low level of income disqualifies them from most lending options and the lack of savings makes it almost impossible for them to set aside $1,000 or more to cover the front payment required by the bank.</span>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, many non-profit organizations like Working Class for Families and New Leaf Services are aware of these problems, and through their charities have provided assistance to countless households going through financial hardship. They operate events and programs that offer struggling families free access to second-hand cars that had been donated by more financially stable families. Some organizations also provide families with ways to repair their cars and run scheduled maintenance at affordable prices.</span>

<a name=""Introduction""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>An Introduction to Section 8 Housing</h3>
The U.S. government created its Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program to give low-income families a hand in paying for their home.

It has helped lift a million-plus people out of poverty while placing them into neighborhoods that are safer and less poor. By doing so, it can improve the well-being of children and their family members while also reducing the financial burden placed on other public programs.

Vouchers are awarded by local public housing agencies (PHA) depending on a family’s size, household income, and other factors. Once a family has a voucher, they can select the housing of their choice, as long as it meets the program’s standards.

[the_ad id=""359""]<!-- Resources -->

<a name=""Requirements""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Eligibility Requirements for Section 8</h3>
Before jumping into the application process for a Housing Choice Voucher, it’s best to know what the Public Housing Authority looks at when determining Section 8 eligibility. In doing so, you’ll have a better idea of the information you’ll need to provide when applying.

Here are the four significant factors a PHA will use to determine your eligibility for a voucher:
<h4>1. The size of your family.</h4>
In the government’s eyes, a family doesn’t necessarily mean a large group of people living under one roof. Instead, here are the various arrangements that qualify as a “family” when it comes to Section 8 eligibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Family with or without children – Even if a child is temporarily residing outside of the home and is in foster care, it is still considered part of the family.</li>
 	<li>Displaced family – If all family members are no longer living in the home due to destruction from a disaster, extensive damage, or removal by government action, they fall under the displaced category.</li>
 	<li>Disabled family – When a family’s head of household or single member has disabilities, two or more people in the home have disabilities, or one person has disabilities and resides with a live-in aide, it falls under the disabled category.</li>
 	<li>Elderly family – Where the head of household or single family member, two or more members, or one member residing with a live-in aide is at least 62 years old.</li>
 	<li>Remaining member of a tenant family – Where all members of a family receiving voucher assistance have moved out of a home, but one remains.
Single person – Someone who does not fit into any of the above categories.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Family income limits.</h4>
The Housing Choice Voucher Program was created to help low-income families who need it most. For this reason, income limits make up a considerable part of the PHA’s decision of who to award vouchers to.

Income limits vary by location and the number of family members in a household. They can also change from year to year. The PHA will place a family into three different categories depending on their income:
<ul>
 	<li>Extra low income</li>
 	<li>Very low income</li>
 	<li>Low income</li>
</ul>
For the most part, a family cannot earn more than 50 percent of the median income where they plan to live to be eligible for a voucher. The law requires PHAs to award 75 percent of their vouchers to extremely low-income households. This refers to families whose income sits below 30 percent of the poverty line or local median, whichever is higher.

If you’re worried that your income may be too high for Section 8, know that the more members in your family, the more you can make and still qualify.

You can view an example of Section 8 income limits here, where you’ll see how requirements fluctuate as family members grow. The maximum number of family members is eight.
<h4>3. Your citizenship status</h4>
The citizenship requirement for Section 8 can be a bit confusing. While citizens and certain permanent residents are technically the only ones eligible to receive help, other family members can still benefit from the program.

If a family has a variety of citizenship statuses amongst its members, it can receive prorated voucher assistance. This just means that the amount of money they’ll receive will be based on the number of family members who meet the citizenship eligibility requirements.

<h4>4. Your eviction history</h4>
If you were evicted from public housing or a Section 8 rental in the past due to drug-related criminal activity, you will have to wait at least three years from the eviction date to be eligible for assistance.

Now that you know which factors your Public Housing Authority will take into consideration, it’s time to begin the Section 8 application process. But before you do, it’s a good idea to know what type of information and documents you’ll be expected to provide.

<a name=""Paperwork""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Information and Paperwork You’ll Need to Apply for a Housing Choice Voucher</h3>
There’s no better time than now to start collecting the documents you’ll need to apply for Section 8. You’ll need them for each family member, so they could take some time to gather.

Here are the basics:
<ul>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Social security card</li>
 	<li>Photo ID from the state or government</li>
 	<li>Driver’s license</li>
 	<li>Passport (if you are not a United States citizen)</li>
 	<li>Immigration documents (for both registered immigrants and aliens)</li>
 	<li>Immigrant status verification that’s signed</li>
</ul>

You’ll also need several documents to help prove that you fall within Section 8’s income limits. These will be harder to come by, but are necessary to complete the application process:
<ul>
 	<li>Proof of income, such as W2 forms, tax returns, and pay stubs</li>
 	<li>Bank statements</li>
 	<li>Information on assets, if you own any</li>
 	<li>Paperwork showing you receive benefits from public assistance</li>
 	<li>Social Security benefit verification letter</li>
</ul>
Without all of these documents, you will have a hard time getting approved. The PHA will use all of the information to see if you are first eligible for a voucher. If so, it will then use the same information to determine the voucher amount so you can pick out the appropriate Section 8 housing.

All of your paperwork and application answers must be authentic and true. The PHA will verify your information via local agencies, your bank, and employer to ensure it is correct.

<h3>How to Apply for a Section 8 Housing Voucher</h3>
You should try to apply for the Housing Choice Voucher Program as soon as possible since waiting lists can be quite long. Here are the steps to complete the process.

<h4>1. Locate your public housing agency.</h4>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a website where you can find your local PHA. This is the first step to the Section 8 application process, as you’ll need to contact your PHA to find out more information about voucher requirements specific to your area.

Finding your PHA is as easy as clicking on the state you live in and scrolling down until you find the office nearest you.
<h4>2. See if you’re eligible</h4>
The application can only proceed if you’re eligible for Section 8 assistance. Your PHA will help determine this by taking your family size and income into account.

As mentioned, the general rule for voucher eligibility is that your family’s income cannot be higher than 50 percent of the median income for your area. In addition, citizenship status and any eviction history will be reviewed before you can continue to apply.
<h4>3. Get a Housing Choice Voucher Program application</h4>
If you’re good to go in terms of all of the eligibility requirements, it’s now time to get the official application so you can kickstart the process.

Your local PHA can point you in the right direction of where to get an application for free. Depending on where you live, you may get it online, in person at the PHA, or via mail.
<h4>5. Complete the application</h4>
Take your time completing the application. You want to be as thorough as possible and ensure all the information is correct and truthful.

While the length may vary according to your PHA, expect to fill out basic information on things like date of birth, gross income, mailing address, phone number, criminal history, and more. Remember that these fields must be filled out for each family member, as they will affect your eligibility and the size of your voucher.

Your housing counselor should give you directions on how to fill out the application correctly. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact them first. This application could be your one shot at securing affordable rent in a safe home.
<h4>6. Submit the application on time</h4>
As stated, the waiting list for the Housing Choice Voucher Program can be quite lengthy. As such, you do not want any delays in submitting your application that could stall the process even more.

Use your PHA’s instructions to apply once it’s fully complete. To avoid rejection, make sure it’s submitted by the due date.
<h4>7. Be patient</h4>
Waiting is an unfortunate but necessary part of the Section 8 application process. Your application could take a few months to process, so sit tight.

After it’s processed, you will either be rejected or accepted and put onto a waiting list.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<a name=""WaitingList""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>The Housing Choice Voucher Program Waiting List</h3>
Once the PHA deems you eligible for a Section 8 voucher, you’ll have to wait until you actually receive it. Although the thought of waiting even more to receive government rental assistance may be daunting, at least you know you’ve made the cut.

You’ll rarely get a housing voucher immediately after approval. Since the demand for housing assistance is much higher than the supply of vouchers, sitting on the waiting list for an extended period is quite common.

Getting on a waiting list itself is an accomplishment, however, due to several factors. Some PHAs limit applications to specific periods. Others will close their waiting lists if they receive too many requests.

Luckily, you can apply via various PHAs if the one nearest you has a waiting list that is closed or too long. Ask your PHA to give you a list of where you can do this so you can widen your opportunities and shorten the time spent without assistance.

Once your name on the waiting list is reached, your PHA will tell you how to receive your voucher. To accelerate this, be sure to disclose any of the following situations on your application if they apply:
<ul>
 	<li>Your family has been involuntarily displaced by the government or due to disaster.</li>
 	<li>You’re currently living in substandard housing.</li>
 	<li>You’re paying more than half of your income in rent.</li>
 	<li>You’re homeless.</li>
</ul>
Such situations could gain PHA preference and move you farther up the waiting list, depending on the housing needs and priorities of your community.

<a name=""VoucherValue""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Section 8 Voucher Value</h3>
A common misconception about Section 8 is that it allows low-income families to live completely rent-free. The truth is, families are required to pay 30 percent of their income or a minimum of $50 towards rent and utilities, whichever is higher, under the program.

The Housing Choice Voucher will cover the rest of the costs. There is a cap or “payment standard” to this coverage, however, that the PHA sets. This standard represents what it costs to rent a local home that’s moderately priced.

Can you choose a home that’s higher than the payment standard for your area? Sure, but you’ll have to pay any extra costs for that luxury.

Once your voucher value is determined, the PHA will pay that amount directly to your landlord every month. You will be responsible for paying the rest of the rent promptly.

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Choosing a Section 8 Home</h3>
Another misconception about the Section 8 program is that you’ll have to live in a subsidized housing project once accepted. On the contrary, you can choose any housing that qualifies under the program's requirements, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Apartments</li>
 	<li>Townhomes</li>
 	<li>Single-family homes</li>
</ul>
Should it qualify, a family can also use their voucher to help pay the rent at their current residence.

To qualify, a home must meet Housing Quality Standards that cover such factors as:
<ul>
 	<li>A working kitchen</li>
 	<li>Access</li>
 	<li>Electricity and light</li>
 	<li>Indoor air quality</li>
 	<li>Materials and structure</li>
 	<li>Neighborhood</li>
 	<li>No use of lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Overall cleanliness</li>
 	<li>Sanitary bathrooms</li>
 	<li>Security and space</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Temperature control</li>
 	<li>Trash disposal</li>
 	<li>Water availability</li>
</ul>
If that list seems lengthy or complicated, don’t worry, as your PHA’s counselor will tell you what to look for so your home qualifies. This information will include the unit size you’re eligible for according to your family size.

You’ll have at least 60 days to use your voucher. Once again, you can use it to pay the rent in your current home or the new home you choose. Regardless of which route you pick, here’s what will have to happen to make your move acceptable:
<ul>
 	<li>The landlord will have to accept Section 8 vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA must confirm that the home meets local Housing Quality Standards.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA must confirm that the rent is reasonable compared to similar homes in the area.</li>
</ul>
After your home is chosen and approved, you will have to sign a minimum 12-month lease with the landlord. A security deposit may be required that cannot be more than one month's rent. After the contract is complete, your landlord can start a new one or allow you to stay in the home on a month-to-month basis.

<a name=""Roles""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Roles and Responsibilities Under Section 8</h3>
Here are primary responsibilities that come with being a Section 8 tenant:
<ul>
 	<li>Follow the lease agreement.</li>
 	<li>Follow the Housing Choice Voucher Program requirements.</li>
 	<li>Pay rent on time.</li>
 	<li>Maintain the unit in good condition.</li>
 	<li>Notify the PHA if the family has any changes in composition or income.</li>
 	<li>Abstain from any criminal activity that includes bribery, fraud, or drug offenses, among others.</li>
</ul>
You, as a tenant, aren’t the only one with responsibilities once a voucher has been disbursed, as the landlord, Public Housing Authority, and HUD have roles too.

The landlord must ensure that the housing unit meets Housing Quality Standards (HQS) while they receive voucher payments. The home must be safe and clean while being offered at a reasonable rent. Just like the tenant, the landlord must follow the lease agreement. Also, they must conform to the housing assistance payments contract signed with the PHA.

The PHA must supply voucher assistance to the family and make payments to the landlord. It has the right to stop those payments, however, if the landlord does not follow the lease agreement or the payment contract. The PHA will also do the following on an annual basis:
<ul>
 	<li>Review the family’s composition.</li>
 	<li>Review the family’s income.</li>
 	<li>Inspect the home to ensure it meets HQS.</li>
</ul>
Lastly, the HUD will transfer funds to the PHA so it can make voucher payments. It pays the PHA a fee for handling the Housing Choice Voucher Program and lets them apply for more vouchers to assist additional families. The department also oversees the PHA to ensure they’re following program guidelines.

<a name=""Benefits""></a>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Keeping Section 8 Benefits When You Move</h3>
Just because you have a voucher for one Section 8 home does not mean you cannot move to another. To do so without seeing a lapse in your assistance, contact your PHA before you make the move.

When moving to a new home, you will first be responsible for ending the existing lease with your landlord. You will also have to ensure that your new residence meets Housing Quality Standards.

Before you can move to an entirely new place, you will be expected to live for at least one year in the original service area of the PHA where you were first approved for a voucher. Again, contact your PHA first to avoid any lapses or, even worse, losses in benefits.

If you would like to become a homeowner after receiving Section 8 assistance, the Homeownership Voucher Program can help. It allows families to use their Section 8 benefits towards mortgage payments.

Rules and even the benefit calculation of the Housing Choice Voucher Program will apply should you make this move. You must also meet such criteria as:
<ul>
 	<li>Being a first-time homeowner.</li>
 	<li>No primary family member can own or partially own residential property.</li>
 	<li>No family member has either owned or partially owned their own home for at least three years.</li>
</ul>
Besides those basics, there will be minimum income requirements, as well as any rules set out by your local PHA. You will also have to complete a pre-assistance homeownership program and a course on housing counseling to fully qualify.

80,"Could You Qualify For Habitat For Humanity Housing?","You’ve probably heard about Habitat for Humanity and know the gist of what it does, but how well do you really know it?

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’re like most, you probably don’t know much about Habitat for Humanity beyond hearing their name in the news or commercials. In fact, you may think they just give away free homes to those in need on a random basis.

The truth is, Habitat for Humanity is a housing program that you could even qualify for. It’s not necessarily for the impoverished, nor do they give away “free” homes. To see what it takes to secure Habitat for Humanity housing, let’s discuss some of the basics.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>What Habitat for Humanity Does</h3>
To understand what Habitat for Humanity housing was meant to do in a nutshell, look no further than this quote from their official website:

“Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit organization that helps families build and improve places to call home. We believe affordable housing plays a critical role in strong and stable communities.”

As you can see, they not only build new homes for families, but they also improve existing ones to make them more livable, safe, and efficient.

If you were to hire a real estate agent to show you homes, they would likely pick places that are too big and expensive for your budget. Habitat for Humanity, on the other hand, prefers to build homes that are small, easy to maintain, and that result in lower monthly utility bills.

In short, if you’d like to own a home but are scared of the costs, Habitat for Humanity housing could be right up your alley, as long as you’re eligible.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Eligibility Requirements for Habitat for Humanity Housing</h3>
Since Habitat for Humanity operates globally in over 70 countries and the entire United States, its eligibility requirements vary. Eligibility is determined on a local basis, but here are some of the basic requirements you could run into:
<ul>
 	<li>You must be a legal resident.</li>
 	<li>You must have decent credit.</li>
 	<li>You must have a stable income.</li>
</ul>
If eligible for Habitat housing, you will not be gifted the home. You will be expected to pay a mortgage on it via monthly payments, and a small down payment will likely be necessary.

Your income cannot be too high or low to be eligible for a Habitat house. You can find out your local requirements by searching the Habitat for Humanity site.

Beyond making your mortgage payments on time, something else is required to own Habitat for Humanity housing: sweat equity.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

You will be expected to build your home or someone else’s with volunteers. This requirement is a staple of the Habitat program, but if you are unable to perform physical labor, you can complete homeowner classes or volunteer in other ways.

No construction experience is required to build a Habitat home, but you will have to put in some time. In Los Angeles, California, for example, 200 hours of sweat equity are required.

While this may seem like a lot, you are getting the opportunity to own a home while helping others, which makes it all worth it.",,"2020-08-10 04:38:03",post,https://section8assist.com/could-you-qualify-for-habitat-for-humanity-housing/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_642173251.jpg,shutterstock_642173251.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_642173251.jpg,82,shutterstock_642173251,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_642173251.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,could-you-qualify-for-habitat-for-humanity-housing,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 19:11:01"
85,"Find Affordable, Senior-Friendly Apartments With The Section 202 Program","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

When it comes to housing for seniors, two things usually come to mind. First, the housing should be affordable, since many seniors are no longer employed and are living on a fixed and sometimes limited income. Second, the housing should be senior-friendly to accommodate any special needs and make living as safe and convenient as possible.

The Section 202 program prioritizes those two necessities. In doing so, it’s helped develop hundreds of thousands of apartments that have made affordable and safe living a reality for many seniors.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How Section 202 Stands Out From Other Housing Assistance Program</h4>
Section 8 has stolen the spotlight when it comes to affordable housing for those trying to make the most out of a meager income. Section 202, on the other hand, specifies the need for similar housing for seniors, but with a twist that comes via several unique features that can be found in its units, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Ramps</li>
 	<li>Grab rails</li>
 	<li>Wheelchair accessible-units</li>
</ul>
While those features are enough to attract any senior, Section 202 also emphasizes services that offer necessities as well as luxuries.

For example, some Section 202 developments may have social spaces where residents can mingle with others, enjoy events, and dine. Others may have care coordinators to help with day-to-day activities like bathing, meals, and administering medication.

Since some seniors are not mobile and can no longer drive, transportation services from a Section 202 community can help. And to ensure they remain active and in good spirits, some offer daily activities.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How Section 202 Makes Rent More Affordable</h4>
Having access to so many features and services may make you worry about a high price tag. With Section 202, though, there’s no need to worry.

If you qualify for this program, you will only have to pay rent equal to 30 percent of your income. The program will handle the rest, so you won’t have to stress over a limited budget.
<h4>Determining Section 202 Eligibility</h4>
Approval for Section 202 benefits does not require that you provide documentation that you are a citizen, noncitizen, etc. Someone in the household will have to be at least 62 years old, however, and income cannot pass 50 percent of the median income for the area where you want to live.

Criminal convictions can make approval more difficult, especially if you’ve been convicted of a felony for a violent or drug-related offense. Adverse history with housing authorities, such as eviction, debt, termination of assistance, etc. can also make it harder to qualify.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Section 202’s Application Process</h4>
If you’ve been thinking of finding affordable housing for seniors, do not waste time applying for Section 202. Demand for the program’s resources is sky-high, and waiting lists can be long in some locations.

You’ll have to apply directly to a Section 202 landlord or management company. To start, though, it’s best to contact your local Public Housing Agency, as they can point you in the right direction and help with other forms of assistance.","There’s no need for seniors to overpay for housing.

The list of expenses a homeowner must pay is quite long. While homeowner's insurance is an expense you can’t necessarily eliminate, you can undoubtedly lower it with the following strategies:
<h4>Bundle Your Insurance Policies</h4>
Chances are, you have auto insurance to cover your car. By purchasing all of your coverage with the same company, you can often enjoy a multi-line discount.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Not only are the savings (which are sometimes 10 percent) nice when you bundle, but so is the convenience of only having to deal with one insurance company.
<h4>Raise Your Credit Score</h4>
Although you’re not taking out a loan or applying for a charge card here, your credit score matters when it comes to homeowner’s and other types of insurance. The higher your score, the less you’ll have to pay for your premium.

You can now get your free credit report once a year. Take advantage of this offer so you can see your score and strategize on how to improve it.
<h4>Increase Your Deductible</h4>
The insurance deductible is how much money you’ll have to pay out of pocket when making a claim. The higher your deductible, the lower your premium.

You can see significant savings here. To play it safe, however, keep that higher deductible amount stashed in savings account just in case you need it down the line.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Know Insurance Prices Before Purchasing Your Home</h4>
The last thing you want to have happen is to experience sticker shock when seeing how much your homeowner’s insurance costs. To prevent this, get a quote before buying your home.

You’d be surprised at how similar homes can have wildly different insurance costs, so don’t assume anything. Insurance is something you’ll need, so it’s best to factor its price in your home buying decision.
<h4>Only Insure the Home</h4>
Various things can damage a home, such as floods, fires, and more. The land, on the other hand, is less likely to suffer.

Keep this in mind and stick to insuring the home and not the land to score some extra savings.
<h4>Add Protective Features to Your Home</h4>
A generator, storm shutters, or a reinforced roof do have upfront costs, but they can save you in the long run in more ways than one.

First, they can protect against storms like hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes. Second, they can lower your premium by making your home safer.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Add an Alarm System</h4>
Protect your home and family by installing an alarm system in your home. It can give you some added peace of mind while also lowering your premium.

If you add features like water sensors to the system, you can save even more.
<h4>Don’t Smoke</h4>
Smoking can be harmful to your health and your home. Since smokers can accidentally cause fires, they can end up paying higher premiums.

Quit smoking, and you can enjoy lower homeowner’s insurance costs while possibly lowering your health insurance costs too.","Do you find it tough to meet your monthly budget?

95,"6 Costly Home Improvements That Can Make It Harder To Sell Your Home","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Why might you renovate or improve your home? To either make it more functional, comfortable, and enjoyable for your family, or to make it more attractive to prospective buyers.

Unfortunately, some home improvement projects may seem great on the surface, but can actually hurt you in the long run.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are projects that can make it harder to sell your home since they can decrease its value:
<h4>1. Swimming Pools</h4>
Pools are money pits. And while they can be a cooling and eye-catching addition to your home, here are specific reasons why you might want to skip on that backyard oasis:
<ul>
 	<li>High installation/construction costs.</li>
 	<li>Time-consuming and costly to maintain.</li>
 	<li>Create hazards for young children and pets.</li>
</ul>
According to HouseLogic, installing an in-ground pool can increase a home’s value by an average of seven percent. That’s not a huge increase when you consider all the work and expenses that are involved.

Oh, and if you think installing an above-ground pool is a safer, less expensive route, know this: Some buyers prefer to have such pools removed before purchasing a home.

In short, they can be seen as more of a nuisance than a benefit.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Garages</h4>
If you’re thinking about building a standalone garage to give your home some automobile storage space, hold that thought.

Building standalone garages can break the bank, as their average cost ranges from $20,000 to $40,000.

Will you recoup that cost when selling your home? It isn’t very likely.
<h4>3. Unique Décor</h4>
Whether it’s odd-colored paint or really weird tile, think twice before installing something that most of the population may see as an eyesore.

The more neutral the décor, the better, especially if you’re looking to sell soon.
<h4>4. Built-In Entertainment</h4>
If you’re a movie fanatic, installing a home theater may seem like a smart move. That prospective home buyer may not feel the same, however.

They may not want to pay a premium for such a space that could be used as something else or could increase electricity costs. Like a pool, this luxury could turn into a burden.
<h4>5. Carpeting</h4>
Carpet can look nice right after it’s installed, but after some time, it can show signs of wear.

For this reason, many people now prefer tile or wood flooring, as it can maintain its look and be easier to keep clean.

If you install wall-to-wall carpeting, know that a possible buyer may get turned off once they see it.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Bathroom Upgrades</h4>
You may see the bathroom as your sanctuary, and this may move you to install a tub or jacuzzi that’s anything but cheap.

How much of that expense can you recoup? Not much of it, according to some experts.

Add on to your bathroom, and you may recover around half of what it cost to install. Even worse, a buyer may not see something like a jacuzzi, for example, as functional and fitting their lifestyle.

As with other items on this list, the simpler, the better, unless you plan on living in your home for decades to come.","While you may have the best intentions with a home improvement project, here are some that are not only costly, but can decrease the resale value of your house.","2020-08-10 04:42:09",post,https://section8assist.com/6-costly-home-improvements-that-can-make-it-harder-to-sell-your-home/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_108375557.jpg,shutterstock_108375557.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_108375557.jpg,97,shutterstock_108375557,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_108375557.jpg,"Work From Home","Debt Help",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,6-costly-home-improvements-that-can-make-it-harder-to-sell-your-home,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 19:10:11"

The coronavirus has opened our eyes to just how important health can be. Unfortunately, staying healthy can come at quite a financial cost if you don’t have affordable insurance. Even worse, being unemployed can make health insurance seem impossible to attain if you lose coverage through your employer.

If you recently lost your job due to COVID-19 layoffs or for some other reason, don’t fret, as there are ways to get subsidized coverage for you and your family. Let’s take a look at some of them now.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>A Marketplace Insurance Plan</h4>
The government offers affordable health insurance plans through its Marketplace. The amount of savings you can achieve will depend on the size of your household and your income.

You can qualify for a Special Enrollment Period through the Marketplace that lasts 60 days from the day you lose employer coverage. It does not matter why you left your job, either. To learn more about the Special Enrollment Period so you can replace lost coverage, go here.

While a Marketplace insurance plan may not be 100 percent free, your premium can be minimal if your income is severely limited. Any out of pocket costs can lower according to your household size and income as well. Add in premium tax credits, and you could get an insurance plan that is much more affordable than you ever imagined.
<h4>Medicaid</h4>
The government’s Medicaid program offers subsidized health coverage to recipients with low incomes or disabilities. Depending on your situation, Medicaid could result in low-cost or free healthcare.

Medicaid does not have a limited enrollment period, making it ideal for someone who just lost their job. You can apply for Medicaid either through your state or via the Health Insurance Marketplace, which can be found here.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</h4>
Perhaps more important than your own health coverage is that of your kids. With CHIP, you can receive a variety of subsidized services for your children in the form of prescriptions, immunizations, free doctor and dental visits, vision and dental care, emergency services, and more.

CHIP comes in particularly handy in cases where your income is too high for Medicaid but not significant enough to afford private health insurance. It’s also offered in some states for pregnant women, and has no limited enrollment period, just like Medicaid.

You can begin the CHIP application process by calling 1-800-318-2596.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Get Healthcare Without Insurance or Income</h4>
Some people find themselves in an unfortunate situation where they just lost their job, have no income, but also no insurance. If you find yourself in this predicament and the options mentioned above do not work, try looking into a community health center for help.

Community health centers are located in urban and rural areas across the country. They offer affordable health care based on your income and could cover any gaps until you get your financial situation in order.","COVID-19 has led to layoffs and massive losses of income.

106,"Section 8 Housing Scams, Beware","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

But before you make any moves, here are some housing-related scams you should beware of.

Scammers love times of desperation, as it gives them the chance to take advantage of those in need. The coronavirus outbreak has caused many people to become desperate due to job and income loss. As they search for ways to save money, scammers have come up with clever cons to separate them from their cash.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s one area where many scams have popped up? Housing, which includes Section 8 vouchers from the government.

While Housing Choice Vouchers can help you save a ton of money in the long run, you could lose your money in the short term should you give in to any of the following cons.
<h4>1. Rental assistance offers for a fee.</h4>
The government created the Section 8 program to help low-income families achieve the dream of safe, affordable housing. As such, they do not charge you fees to get assistance or apply for it.

Whether by email, phone, or in person, avoid scams that promise rental assistance as long as you submit an upfront payment in the form of:
<ul>
 	<li>Cash</li>
 	<li>Check</li>
 	<li>Wire transfer</li>
</ul>
No legitimate rental assistance program, including Section 8, will ask you for money, especially during the coronavirus pandemic.

Scammers have technology that can “spoof” email addresses and phone numbers to appear legitimate or from a government entity. Instead of responding to or answering them, contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA).

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Any unsolicited offers for rental assistance.</h4>
You’ll have to apply to receive a Housing Choice Voucher from the Section 8 program. It will not be given to you. Keeping this in mind, avoid any unsolicited offers that promise Section 8 vouchers out of the blue.
<h4>3. Charging for Section 8 applications.</h4>
You shouldn’t have to pay a penny to receive a Section 8 application, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) strictly prohibits charging any fees to apply. Still, scammers know you may be anxious to begin the application process, which is why they could trick you into paying to start.

If you’re ready to apply for Section 8 so you can save on rent in the future, contact your PHA to get started.
<h4>4. Vouchers in exchange for payment.</h4>
You cannot merely pay for a voucher, nor can you exchange cash for moving up in a waiting list. As stated, there’s an application process involved with Section 8 that everyone must go through.

After you contact your PHA, you can apply for Section 8. If you meet the requirements, you will be placed on a waiting list. Once your turn in line is reached, you will then receive your voucher so you can soon move into your new home.

None of this process can be accelerated by paying someone on the side. If you see any promises for such a service, avoid them at all costs.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Charging deposits to see Section 8 units.</h4>
Legitimate landlords will let you view Section 8 units at no cost. If you see any advertisements on classified websites that charge a deposit to see a unit, it’s most likely a scam.

Although scammers love stealing money, your personal information can be just as valuable. Remember this should you come upon any websites asking you to fill out forms to receive Section 8 information, as they can sell your data to marketing companies or use it to commit identity theft.

111,"Tips For Finding A Legitimate Loan Online","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The Internet makes it easy to find financing when you need money in an emergency. Unfortunately, this convenience comes with a bit of danger thanks to con artists looking to steal your data or money.

How can you stay safe and still <a href=""https://section8assist.com/how-to-get-federal-student-aid-as-an-adult/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">get the loan you need</a>? We’ll discuss that in a bit, but first, let’s look at some risks you face when looking for loans online.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Overpaying for Loans</h4>
Getting approved for a loan shouldn’t lead to a sigh of relief until you figure out how much you’re paying for it. Bad lenders can overcharge in terms of fees and interest to the point that such temporary help becomes a long-term headache.

A reputable lender can give you the same loan that a bad lender can at a much lower price. Add in the safety aspect, and you have plenty of reasons to do your research before picking a lender.
<h4>Having Your Money Stolen</h4>
It doesn’t take much for a fake lender to make a website aimed at preying on potential borrowers. They may guarantee approval and ask for upfront fees to process your application. Once you wire those fees, the lender disappears with your money.
<h4>Identity Theft</h4>
A loan application is loaded with valuable information for con artists. Once they have your Social Security number, date of birth, and other data, they can steal your identity and create long-lasting damage to your credit by opening bogus accounts in your name.

While some sites are set up solely to steal your information, others may allow it to be taken due to inadequate security. Regardless of how your info is stolen, you want to keep it from happening by dealing with reputable lenders who have proper security measures in place to protect your data.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Online Lenders to Avoid</h4>
If a potential lender is linked to any of the following, look elsewhere for your loan:
<ul>
 	<li>Unsolicited phone calls</li>
 	<li>Unsolicited mail that arrives at your house</li>
 	<li>Spam emails</li>
 	<li>Guaranteed approval</li>
 	<li>Upfront fees</li>
 	<li>Request payment by Western Union or wire</li>
 	<li>Lack of professionalism</li>
</ul>
If you see any of the following behavior from a lender, they may be running an unlicensed and illegal practice:
<ul>
 	<li>Charging higher interest rates than your state legally allows</li>
 	<li>Renewing loans with excessively high fees more than your state legally allows, which increases your debt</li>
 	<li>Breaking laws on collecting debt from unpaid or defaulted loans</li>
 	<li>Adding products into your loan that you never agreed to, such as disability or life insurance</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Find a Reputable Lender Online</h4>
Always do your research before submitting any personal data or filling out an application. You can begin this process by checking the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) database, where you’ll find complaints on financial products.

Online reviews can give you greater insight into a lender’s reputation. Just know that all reviews may not be legitimate, as some may be created for marketing purposes.

To overcome fake reviews and gain peace of mind, ask people you trust if they’ve had a positive experience with a specific lender. Popular financial podcasts may also point you in the right direction.","You can find a loan online to fix your finances fast.

116,"These Red Flags Mean It’s Time To Look For A New Lender","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

It’s unfortunate, but there’s no shortage of scams out there when it comes to loans. Con artists know people may let their guard down when times get tough, and they’ll use this to get your personal info or your money.

How can you tell if a lender wants to scam you instead of help you? Look for these red flags.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. They guarantee approval.</h4>
Although it may seem like they help people in need of financing, lenders are in the business to make money, not lose it. What would happen if a lender approved every single person who applied for a loan? They’d take on a ton of risk from people who probably can’t pay them back, which would put them out of business.

If you have no income, lack assets as collateral, and have zero or bad credit history, a reputable lender will probably reject you as a client. Since it’s unlikely that you’d be able to pay back the loan, you would present too much risk in this scenario as a borrower.

How could a lender guarantee approval then? First, they could do it by ensuring they remain profitable via huge fees or incredibly high interest rates. Or they could do it because they want to steal your data or money and aren’t interested in a legitimate loan at all.

In short, if a lender has no interest in knowing your finances and ability to pay, keep shopping around.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. They require upfront fees.</h4>
Why would you pay money to someone who’s supposed to give you a loan? It doesn’t make much sense, but some lenders will request advance fees to process your application or perform some other related task.

What happens if you pay an upfront fee? They’ll keep asking for more fees, until you finally catch on that you’re being scammed.

If it’s a larger loan you’re looking at, such as to purchase a home, that may have a credit check or appraisal fee. Auto loans, personal loans, and other forms of smaller financing should never require a fee. If they do, avoid them.
<h4>3. They request payment via Western Union or wire.</h4>
Again, you shouldn’t have to pay anyone when you need a loan. Still, some lenders may insist you not only pay, but also do it via Western Union or wire.

Why would a lender request this method of payment? To make it easier to steal your money, unlike with a check or credit card that have safety measures in place to combat fraud.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. They lack professionalism.</h4>
A bank may not be your best friend, but its employees will usually do their best to be as professional as possible. A fly-by-night lender, on the other hand, may give you bad vibes that something isn’t right.

Is their website filled with spelling errors? Do you get virus pop-ups on your web browser when visiting their site? If so, do not enter any of your personal data into their forms and avoid doing business with them.

Lastly, if you speak to one of their employees and they are abusive or pressuring you into the loan, take it as a sign to end all contact. If they pressure you that much now, it’s only a sign of things to come.","Don’t let the need for quick cash turn you into the victim of a scam.

121,"Is A VA Loan Your Best Bet For Buying A Home?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Are you an active-duty member of the armed forces or a veteran? If so, you’ve probably heard of VA loans and their homebuying powers.

Many military members and their families have used VA loans to own their dream homes. And with zero percent down payments, low interest rates, affordable closing costs, and no need for private mortgage insurance (PMI), you can’t blame them.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

There are other forms of financing out there, though, so taking the VA route may not be an automatic choice. To help you make the best choice, let’s delve deeper into what VA loans have to offer.
<h4>The Characteristics of a VA Loan</h4>
Can anyone get a VA loan? No, as eligibility is usually limited to veterans, service members, and surviving spouses in some instances.

VA loans cannot be used for just any purpose, either. You can use one to help you buy your primary home. You cannot use it for a second residence or income property, though.

While the eligibility and use of VA loans are a bit restricted to certain people and purpose, banks, mortgage companies, and other private lenders aren’t as strict when it comes to approval. This is because the government backs up to 25 percent of a VA loan in case of default.

With that added guarantee in place, banks can grant VA loans to prospective homeowners with lower credit scores. And they can do it minus the need for private mortgage insurance that can add to the overall cost of owning a home.

If you don’t have much saved for a down payment, a VA loan can be just what the doctor ordered. With zero percent down payments, VA loans are often the financing option of choice for many with slim savings. While other lenders may frown upon high total debt-to-income and mortgage payment-to-income ratios, those who offer VA loans do not.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>An Additional Cost of VA Loans</h4>
As mentioned, you won’t have to pay monthly PMI on a VA loan. You will, however, have to pay the VA a funding fee (usually between 2-3 percent) that’s added to the front of the loan and compounds on a monthly basis.

This funding fee can make a VA loan’s annual percentage rate (APR) higher than other loans, even though it may have a lower interest rate. The interest rate is how much you pay per year to borrow money, while the APR includes interest and any fees in its calculation.

The funding fee could be seen as a downside to VA loans, but you can have it waived if you:
<ul>
 	<li>Are a veteran who receives compensation from the VA for a disability connected to your time in the military.</li>
 	<li>Are a veteran receiving active-duty or retirement pay, but you would be entitled to receive VA compensation for your disability.</li>
 	<li>Are a surviving spouse of a veteran who passed during or from a disability related to service.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Even if you can get the funding fee waived, remember that military life can frequently take you to new destinations. If you’re still active in the service, buying a new home that you may have to move out of soon may not be the best choice.","A Veterans Affairs (VA) loan can be an attractive homebuying tool if you have military ties.

126,"Quick Tricks For Getting Online Jobs With No Experience","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Does the thought of a regular job make you cringe? Would you like to avoid seeing a boss every day while making money from the comfort of your own home? Then working online is your best bet.

Unfortunately, getting online gigs and jobs can be quite competitive. And if you have no experience, getting your foot in the door can be a bit harder than a person with a complete portfolio or profile.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Does this mean you should abandon your dreams of doing online work and stacking cash from your couch? Not at all. It just means you’ll have to get creative when it comes to getting work.

Luckily, you won’t have to brainstorm too much, as this article is about to do most of the work for you.
<h4>Ways to Get Online Work When Nobody Knows You</h4>
Some online workers and freelancers have reached guru status. At this point in the game, so many people know them that they have to turn down job opportunities due to a lack of time.

If this makes you feel intimidated, don’t be. Did these gurus start at the top? No, they started at the bottom just like you are.

You can get there too. But here’s what you’ll have to do to get that significant first gig.
<h4>1. Think of all your relevant experience.</h4>
Let’s say you want to be a freelance writer and get paid to write articles or emails for Internet clients. Your main problem is that you’ve never gotten an online gig before, and you have no examples of existing online work.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Does this mean you’re doomed? No, because you’ve probably written something in the past for school or as a hobby.

Use any relevant experience you can to boost your profile and authority in whatever arena you’re looking to enter. Even if it’s not 100 percent tied to the job in question, it shows clients that you have the ability.

When pitching yourself, tell them that you haven’t done work in their specific field, but you can do it as long as they give you detailed directions.
<h4>2. Offer them a tryout.</h4>
When nobody knows you, and you lack a portfolio or resume, you’ll have to be aggressive. Unlike the gurus, you probably won’t have people coming to you. Instead, you’ll have to go after them.

When applying for an online gig or job, you should be able to see what task is required. Tell the client you’ll perform some variation of that task for free as a tryout. If they like what they see, they can officially hire and pay you for your services.
<h4>3. Get that ever-important first testimonial.</h4>
A testimonial is crucial to getting more work. And your first testimonial is what you’ll need to get over the inexperience hump.

If a client turns down your tryout offer, tell them you’ll do the work for free in exchange for a testimonial.

Tell them that you’re first starting, and not to be alarmed or skeptical. You’re only offering a free service because you’re building a business, and this first testimonial is what you need to get going.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

They’ll probably understand where you’re coming from, and should your work be good enough, you’ll get that much-needed testimonial.

Once you have it, ask that free client for referrals. As long as you did a good job, they’ll likely be happy to do so.

You can boost the incentive to give you referrals even more. Offer a discount on your future rates to that client if they help to expand your network.

As referrals start flowing in, you’ll start getting more work. And if you get to the point that you’re too busy to accept every referral, increase your price.

By requesting more money, you’ll boost your bank account and reputation. Don’t be shy about doing it either, as many clients will gladly pay more if they think they’re getting quality in return.","No experience is no excuse for not getting online work. Try these tricks, and you’ll start getting hired regardless of your resume.","2020-08-10 04:55:06",post,https://section8assist.com/quick-tricks-for-getting-online-jobs-with-no-experience/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1253228203.jpg,shutterstock_1253228203.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1253228203.jpg,128,shutterstock_1253228203,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1253228203.jpg,"Work From Home","Debt Help",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,quick-tricks-for-getting-online-jobs-with-no-experience,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 19:06:27"
131,"3 Simple Tips To Fix Your Finances In 2020 And Beyond","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

It’s a good idea to set New Year’s resolutions every year, as they give you the motivation to improve various aspects of your life. While losing weight or quitting smoking are common resolutions, there’s one area that you should strive to improve every single year: Your finances.

It can be hard to improve your financial situation if you don’t have a solid foundation to stand on. That’s why today we’ll look at three tips to not only make 2020 your most prosperous year yet, but to also help you maximize your money in the years to come.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Find creative ways to increase your income.</h4>
What’s the best way to maximize your money? Make more of it. Luckily, there’s no better age for making more money than now, thanks to the Internet.

You can sell unnecessary items on sites like eBay or Craigslist for extra cash. You can also put your clothes up on Poshmark to see if you get any bites.

Do you have any special skills that could earn you an extra income on the side? Think hard enough, and you can probably find several.

For instance, you could find side gigs on Fiverr or Upwork that will garner income from writing, translating, typing, proofreading, graphic design, and other similar skills.

Or you could find side gigs for more “offline” skills such as babysitting, pet sitting, and yes, even house sitting.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

If you don’t have a ton of extra time to make side money, make the most out of your current position by asking for a raise or requesting extra hours.

As long as you look, you’ll be surprised at how many ways exist to increase your income. The more income you make, the more financial freedom you’ll have.
<h4>2. Look into debt consolidation.</h4>
What can you do with all that extra income from the first tip in this list? Use it to pay down debt so you can sleep easier at night.

Depending on your situation, you may have debt in many different places. This can make it even more intimidating as you try to manage multiple interest rates, balances, and correspondence from creditors.

How can you simplify your debt to make it easier to tackle? Consolidate it so that it’s all in one place, with one payment, one term, and one interest rate.

While debt consolidation isn’t for everyone, it’s worth a look if you want to get serious about becoming debt-free. Just the mental aspect of having one payment could help you get rid of your debt faster.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Check your credit.</h4>
You may be scared to check your credit report if you have a plethora of outstanding debt. As scary as it may be, however, you should look at your credit report to ensure everything is correct.

A quick scan of your credit report could show errors by the reporting bureaus or creditors. You can point out those errors and get them removed.

Once they’re gone, you can increase your credit score and secure financing in the future with more favorable terms. This can make it easier to make big purchases like a car or home, while saving you money in the long run via lower interest rates.","Want to make 2020 your best year yet when it comes to money?

136,"Use This SMART Goal Method To Make 2020 Money Moves And More","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Do you find yourself making the same New Year’s resolutions every time January 1st rolls around? If so, you’re certainly not alone. And as for why this may be happening, it’s probably because you’re <a href=""https://section8assist.com/3-simple-ways-to-force-yourself-to-save-money/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">not setting the right goals</a> in the first place.

What makes a goal “right”? Several elements, which is what the SMART method entails.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is the SMART Method?</h4>
The SMART method is a guide you can use to set goals. It is made from the following acronym, which tends to vary, and describes characteristics that each objective should have:
<ol>
 	<li>Specific</li>
 	<li>Measurable</li>
 	<li>Achievable</li>
 	<li>Relevant</li>
 	<li>Time-bound</li>
</ol>
If you set a goal that has those characteristics above, it will not only be crystal clear, but also extremely achievable.

Now let’s break down each part of a SMART goal and create examples based on a desire to save and make more money this year.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>1. Specific</h4>
If your goal is not specific, you won’t have the motivation needed to achieve it.

To make a specific goal, answer these five questions:
<ol>
 	<li>What is the goal that you want to accomplish?</li>
 	<li>Why is the goal important?</li>
 	<li>Who will be involved in helping you reach the goal?</li>
 	<li>Where is the goal located?</li>
 	<li>Which resources will you use to achieve the goal, and are they limited in any way?</li>
</ol>
Example: “I want to have extra money saved up this year so that I can move my family into a better apartment. I will first ask for a raise/more hours from my current boss. I will also do babysitting and pet sitting side gigs online to make extra money, while only eating out once a month to cut costs.”
<h4>2. Measurable</h4>
A goal must be measurable so you can track your progress. To make it measurable, answer these questions:
<ol>
 	<li>How many or how much?</li>
 	<li>When will it be finished?</li>
</ol>
Example: “I want an extra $5,000 saved up by December 31st.”
<h4>3. Achievable</h4>
While it’s good to aim high with your goals, they must be realistic so you can achieve them. To make your goal realistic, answer these questions:
<ol>
 	<li>How will you accomplish the goal?</li>
 	<li>When considering limitations, how realistic is the goal?</li>
</ol>
Example: “I have many years at my job, so asking for a raise is not out of the question. Since I have kids, a dog, and plenty of babysitting and pet sitting experience, making extra money from such gigs shouldn’t be difficult. Also, I can easily reduce eating out to just once a month.”

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Relevant</h4>
The goal must matter to you. If not, you won’t feel motivated to achieve it. Answer these questions to determine if the goal is relevant to you:
<ol>
 	<li>Is this goal worth your time?</li>
 	<li>Is now the right time to go after it?</li>
 	<li>Does the goal align with your needs?</li>
</ol>
Example: “Now is the right time to save an extra $5,000 by the end of the year since I’m ready to upgrade my family’s living conditions. We’ll have better schools at our disposal, and getting a raise and doing extra work is something I’ve wanted to do for years.”
<h4>5. Time-bound</h4>
You need that target date to push you towards reaching the goal. Having it also helps you break down the steps to achieve it.

Make your goal time-bound by answering these questions:
<ol>
 	<li>When must the goal be accomplished?</li>
 	<li>What can you do in the next six months to move towards it?</li>
 	<li>What can you do today?</li>
</ol>
Example: “December 31st is when I must have the extra $5,000 sitting in my bank account. In the next six months, I can have a solid network of people needing my babysitting and pet sitting services. Today, I can sign up to a site like Care.com to find my first gig to start building my online reputation and get more work.”

141,"How To Start Setting Up Your Financial Future Today","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

How hard is it to start setting up your financial future? Not hard at all, which is a good thing since it’s so crucial to do.

As simple as the following steps may seem, they’re recommended to start fixing your finances this year so you can flourish in the future.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Fix your credit.</h4>
Bad credit can keep you from buying things like a home or car at the lowest cost possible. It can result in higher interest rates, or it could prevent you from getting any financing at all.

Do you need to pay an expert to start fixing your credit? No, you just need to get your free credit report and start looking for any mistakes.

Are there any accounts that are reported as past due, even though you’ve always paid them on time? Call the company to get them removed so you can boost your credit score.

At the same time, keep your eyes peeled for any accounts you may have forgotten about. Any delinquent accounts or even missed payments could negatively impact your credit, so you’ll want to address them as soon as possible.
<h4>2. Tackle high-interest debt.</h4>
Paying off debt can take a significant load off of your back. When paying it off, tackle the debt that has the highest interest rate first.

The higher the interest, the faster the debt can grow. This is why high-interest loans should receive priority when it comes to paying.

If you want to make certain loans easier to pay off, consider refinancing them. The Fed’s announcement of reduced interest rates means you could pay less interest and have lower monthly payments. Both will help you pay off debt faster.

<h4>3. Build your emergency fund.</h4>
Whether it’s to cover car repairs or an unexpected medical bill, having an emergency fund protects your finances.

For instance, let’s say you only have $500 in your emergency fund, but you need a car engine repair that costs $1,500. How will you pay the rest? By putting $1,000 on a credit card, which instantly puts you in debt.

If your emergency fund were larger, you wouldn’t need to go into debt. You could protect your credit score, avoid monthly payments, and have added peace of mind that comes with being debt-free.

For these reasons, many suggest you should have three to six months of cash for emergency expenses. If you don’t, now’s the time to start adding to that fund by cutting other costs, such as entertainment.
<h4>4. Contribute more to your retirement.</h4>
Add at least a one percent contribution to your company’s 401(k). It can boost your retirement fund in a big way as the years go by.

Don’t have a 401(k)? Open up an IRA and make small contributions to it. The move will only take a few minutes to make, but it can provide security for years to come.

If you don’t have much extra income to contribute to your retirement, don’t fret. Something is better than nothing, so put away what you can.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Change your mindset from spending to saving.</h4>
Challenge yourself to stop spending so much and start saving more. You can do this by cutting back on little things like eating out.

For example, you may eat out every Friday night, resulting in a bill that’s $100, on average. Instead of putting that towards food, put it into your emergency fund.

Over time, you’ll be surprised at how much money you can sock away for a rainy day. And you can use this trick to save for any goal, including retirement.","It’s never too early to set up your financial future.

146,"5 Quick Tips To Lower Your Phone Bill","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

You probably carry a cell phone with you everywhere you go. And while it may be useful, the same may not be true for your landline.

Yes, as outdated as it may seem, many people still have a landline for several purposes. If you’re one of them and feel like you’re paying more than you should, <a href=""https://section8assist.com/paying-more-than-10-for-internet-see-why-you-shouldnt/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here are some tips to get a price break</a>.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Once finished, you should have some extra wiggle room in your budget to save towards your emergency fund or pay down debt.
<h4>1. Get rid of your landline.</h4>
The simplest route to save on your home phone bill is to eliminate it.

When should you do this? If you find that you never use your landline, or that you get nothing but scam or telemarketing calls on it.

As long as your cell phone is in good working condition and has reliable service, you should be able to cut the traditional phone cord without too much fuss.

To accommodate this change, you may want to ensure your cell phone plan includes unlimited minutes, so you avoid overage charges.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Only buy the phone services you need.</h4>
The typical home phone line can cost around $40. That’s as much as many cell phone plans, and it may not be necessary.

What can cause a landline’s price tag to be so high? All the bells and whistles that come with it, such as caller ID, call waiting, and more.

Call your provider to see how much a basic phone line costs. You can then add any extras and skip features you don’t use.
<h4>3. Go for the bundle.</h4>
Do you use the same company for your home phone, Internet, and cable TV service? If you don’t have those services bundled, you could be missing out on some savings.

By bundling, you give the company an incentive to offer an extra discount. It also makes your bills easier to pay.

If you’re asked to sign a contract, look over the fine print. A cheaper introductory rate could increase after a certain period.
<h4>4. Make the move to VoIP.</h4>
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) uses a Web connection to make calls. The call quality may not be as good as a traditional line, but it can result in some savings.

This option may be worth looking at if you make a lot of international calls, but are sick of seeing that monthly expense arrive in the mail.

While you may have to purchase some equipment to start, VoIP can eliminate a monthly bill if you choose a company like Ooma.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Shop around.</h4>
Do you feel like you’re paying way too much for your landline? Are you unhappy with the service also? If you answered yes to either one of those questions, a quick phone call could cut your monthly home phone costs.

A simple trick that often works is to say that you want to cancel your plan. To retain you, the company may offer a discount.

If you’re still not satisfied, shopping around could open your eyes to more attractive home phone plans.

Again, read the fine print before signing a contract. While a new phone company could snag you with some savings upfront, a higher price could kick in later.","Are you looking for extra breathing room in your monthly budget?

151,"How To Reduce Your Home Phone Bill Without Getting Rid Of It","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

A home phone line may seem like a thing of the past. After all, who needs one when you can make and receive calls with your cell phone?

The answer is, some people still do need a landline for other reasons, such as:

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Being able to make calls if the power goes out.</li>
 	<li>Unlimited local calls.</li>
 	<li>Not having to worry about recharging batteries.</li>
 	<li>Better clarity and sound quality during calls.</li>
 	<li>Added peace of mind if the need to call 911 arises.</li>
</ul>
If any of those reasons describe your need for a landline, that explains why you still have one. And while it may be seen as a necessity, there’s no need to pay more than it’s worth.

What are some ways to lower your home phone bill without cutting the cord? Here they are:
<h4>Call Your Phone Company</h4>
The first move to make in your quest to lower your phone bill is to call the service provider. Tell them you’re not happy with your monthly bill, and that you’re going to shop around to see if you can snag some savings elsewhere.

Depending on the company, they may connect you to a retention specialist.

What’s their purpose? To keep you as a customer. How will they do this? Most of the time, they will try to retain you by offering a discount on your current service.

Although a discount can help you instantly cut costs while keeping your landline, know that it may not last forever. Be sure to get all the details about the discount and when it ends to avoid any sticker shock later on.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Look for Competitors</h4>
If your call to the phone company doesn’t result in savings, it’s time to shop around and look for a better offer.

This move may take a bit of time, but the good news is that you should certainly have options. Phone companies are more competitive than ever, and this means lower prices for customers.

Who knows? Just a few minutes of research and calling around could result in a new bill that’s a fraction of what you’re currently paying.

In short, it’s best to know that you’re getting the cheapest rate possible. And the only way to honestly do that is to shop around.
<h4>Trim the Fat on Your Phone Plan</h4>
Do you find features such as call waiting or caller ID useless? If you don’t use them at all, call your home phone provider and tell them to remove those features from your plan.

Many phone plans come with bells and whistles from the start, and these unnecessary features can bloat your monthly price.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Save by Bundling</h4>
Are you tired of paying your home phone, cable TV, and Internet bills separately? Do you use the same provider for all of those services? If so, bundle them together to simplify things and cut costs.

You could see instant discounts by bundling. A contract could come into play, however, so don’t forget to check all the details.

As with many low-cost introductory offers, the ones you secure via bundling probably won’t last forever.","If you’re sick of paying an arm and a leg for your home phone line, but still want to keep it, keep reading.","2020-08-10 09:09:27",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-reduce-your-home-phone-bill-without-getting-rid-of-it/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_278141306.jpg,shutterstock_278141306.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_278141306.jpg,153,shutterstock_278141306,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_278141306.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-reduce-your-home-phone-bill-without-getting-rid-of-it,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-07-26 14:04:07"
156,"6 Tricks To Grab Bargains While Grocery Shopping","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

When you think of ways to save when grocery shopping, clipping coupons is probably at the top of your list. And while coupons can cut your costs when it comes to food, there are other, more clever ways to achieve that same goal.

We’ll save the coupon tips for another day, as today’s focus will be on the following simple tricks to grab bargains while grocery shopping.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Go full size, not fun size.</h4>
Here’s a general rule that can make saving while shopping much simpler: The more packaging, the bigger the premium you pay.

For example, have you seen those tiny snack packs promising just 100 calories per serving? Sure, they can help with portion control and give you a quick way to grab a snack on the go, but you’re paying extra for that convenience.

The same holds for a product like yogurt. Buy a pack of six small yogurts, and you’ll pay a premium for all of that extra packaging.

What’s the moral of the story? Buy items in bulk, then make your own small bags or portions later on.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Don’t purchase produce individually.</h4>
Did you know that a lot of produce first gets sorted by its size? They just don’t put it on display. Instead, they pick out the biggest pieces and put them on sale individually.

What do they do with the smaller, less impressive pieces? They place them in packages, and you can save by buying them instead of opting for more expensive pieces sold by themselves.
<h4>3. Purchase frozen produce.</h4>
If you find that you’re often throwing away produce because it spoils, there’s a way to stop all of that waste: Buy frozen.

The main benefit of frozen produce is that it lasts longer. This helps you pick out what you need and freeze the rest.

In the end, you avoid waste and that rushed feeling of having to eat a ton of food fast, so you don’t have to toss it out.
<h4>4. Avoid prepared foods and buy them whole instead.</h4>
Chopped fruit is an example of prepared food that is convenient and delicious. If you buy the fruit whole, however, and chop it up yourself, you can save some extra cash.
<h4>5. Get fish and other seafood frozen.</h4>
Produce isn’t the only frozen food that can save you money over its fresh counterpart.

Seafood is another, so get it frozen, and you probably won’t notice the difference. Your wallet, however, will, as you’ll avoid that premium that’s charged for thawing it once the seafood gets to the store.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Choose your cheese wisely.</h4>
Cheese that’s fresh from the deli can seem like a delicacy, but at what cost?

If you chose cheese from the refrigerated section instead, you can reduce the per-pound price. As an added benefit, it usually lasts longer than the slices you get from the deli too.

Speaking of cheese, get it in blocks if you can. It’s cheaper than slices, and you can cut it up yourself to get the thickness you desire.","Think coupons are the only way to save at the grocery store?

161,"These 3 Challenges Make Saving Affordable And Easy To Do","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

You just need to try the savings challenges in this article, and you’ll be well on your way to stacking cash soon.

What are the two biggest excuses people come up with when it comes to saving money? The most popular one is that they probably don’t have enough room in their budget to do so. And another commonly used excuse is that they lack the financial discipline to stash cash for a rainy day.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Well, if you’ve used either or both of those excuses in the past, guess what? Today’s the day they end. Because as long as you give one of the challenges in this list a go, you’ll start saving money instead of spending it.
<h4>The $5 Challenge</h4>
The next time you pay for something with cash and get a five-dollar bill as part of your change from the cashier, save it. Do this for an entire year, and you will have completed the Five Dollar Challenge.

Will this challenge give you enough money to put a down payment on a house at the end of the year? Probably not, but it can add to your vacation fund or emergency fund.

If you manage to save a pair of five-dollar bills per week, you’ll end up with $520 once the challenge is over.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>The 52-Week Money Challenge</h4>
This challenge has you save a certain amount for 52 weeks. While it’s quite simple to follow, you can end up with a solid sum of $1,278 once it is finished.

To do the 52-Week Money Challenge, start saving as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Save $1 in week one.</li>
 	<li>Save $2 in week two.</li>
 	<li>Save $3 in week three.</li>
 	<li>Save $4 in week four.</li>
 	<li>Save $5 in week five.</li>
 	<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>
The largest deposit you’ll have to make is $52, which isn’t too bad. By the time you get there, you should be used to putting a bit of money away per week, so $52 should be doable in your quest to become a savvy saver.
<h4>The Penny Challenge</h4>
If the 52-Week Money Challenge seems a bit expensive for your taste, try the Penny Challenge instead.

With this challenge, you’ll be saving money daily instead of weekly. Here’s the pattern it follows:
<ul>
 	<li>Save $0.01 on day 1.</li>
 	<li>Save $0.02 on day 2.</li>
 	<li>Save $0.03 on day 3.</li>
 	<li>Save $0.04 on day 4.</li>
 	<li>Save $0.05 on day 5.</li>
 	<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

By increasing the amount you save by just one penny per day, you can end up with $667.95 once the challenge is over.

As for what your biggest deposit will be, it’s nothing more than $3.65 on the final day, making the Penny Challenge quite simple to conquer.

If you give your kids an allowance, do the Penny Challenge with them. It will teach them the value of the dollar and show how powerful putting a bit of money away can be.","You don’t need a substantial income nor loads of financial discipline to start saving money today.

167,"5 Credit-Related Moves You Should Consider Making Right Now","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Why does credit get a bad rap? It’s usually because most of us associate it with financial mistakes from our past.

Credit isn’t all bad, though, since it can help you buy things you need and pay them off over time instead of having to wait. Combine that benefit with a lower interest rate, and credit can be looked at as a friendly loan that can help and not hurt you.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

On the other hand, if you let credit card spending spiral out of control and have to pay a high interest rate, it can do more damage than good. To prevent this from being your reality, let’s look at some credit-related moves you should consider doing now.
<h4>1. Get your free credit report.</h4>
You can’t move towards the future while completely ignoring the past, at least not where credit is concerned.

You need to know your past so you don’t repeat it, and getting your free annual credit report can help you do just that.

Use your free credit report to see your weaknesses. Let it remind you of past credit mistakes you don’t want to repeat.

Also, use it to make sure there are no errors that could hinder your credit score. If there are, you’ll want to contact the companies in question so they can fix the mistakes and raise your score.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Do an audit of your credit card spending.</h4>
Have a look at your credit card statements to see what you’re swiping for. If you see a ton of unnecessary expenses on luxuries like clothes, restaurants, and entertainment, vow to change this spending.

Implementing a rule such as reserving credit cards for emergencies can help. Or you can use them just for necessities like groceries and gas.

For other spending, tell yourself that cash is the only way. This can keep your credit card in your pocket, so you don’t rack up loads of debt you don’t need.
<h4>3. Increase your credit limit.</h4>
Make this move only if you know you can control your spending. Otherwise, it’s best to leave it alone.

How can increasing your credit limit be a sound financial move? Because it can improve your credit utilization ratio, which can boost your credit score.

You can request a credit limit increase by calling your card company or logging into your account.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Put your credit card payments on autopilot.</h4>
The hustle and bustle of everyday life can make it easy to forget to make a payment on time. Reporting bureaus won’t forget, however, and this could negatively impact your credit score.

To prevent missed payments, use autopay. If you can, try to pay the entire balance every month too to reduce what you pay in interest.
<h4>5. Pay more every month.</h4>
If you can’t set autopay to pay the entire balance of your credit card every month, do the best you can. Even paying a few more dollars every month can help you reduce the outstanding debt and the interest owed on it.","Want to make the most out of your credit so you can buy what you need now while paying the lowest interest rates possible?

172,"5 Signs That You’re A Victim Of Identity Theft, Plus How To Stop It","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Even though you may be completely innocent, having your identity stolen can cost you. First, it can cost you money in dealing with all of the problems it can cause. And second, it can cost you a ton of time trying to fix it too.

What’s the key to stopping identity theft in its tracks? Detecting it before the spending and opening of accounts spiral out of control.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How Your Free Annual Credit Report Can Stop Identity Theft</h4>
Early detection of identity theft is an excellent reason to take advantage of your free annual credit report. Even if you’re scared to see your score, you should get your report to identify any unknown accounts or mistakes on your history.

If you see an account on your report that you did not open, don’t automatically assume it’s just a mistake by the company or credit reporting bureau. It could be identity theft, and you should call the company to notify them. Be sure to contact the credit bureau, too, and dispute the account so it can be removed.

Besides new, unknown accounts, check the inquiries section of your credit report as well. If you see companies you don’t recognize have been reviewing your report, place a fraud alert on it. This can force businesses to confirm your identity before they open any new accounts or loans in your name.

You want to keep your eye out for hard inquiries from businesses you're unfamiliar with. Those occur when you apply for credit. If you know you haven’t applied and see a hard inquiry, it may be an identity thief who’s using your information.

Beyond checking your credit report, there are other ways to tell if your identity has been stolen. Here they are:

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>1. You get bills in your name that you never opened.</h4>
When you receive a bill in the mail for a credit card or other loan in your name that you never applied for, contact the company immediately. Let them know you think your identity has been stolen, and they can proceed to fix the issue from there.
<h4>2. You no longer receive your credit card bills.</h4>
If you missed one month’s credit bill, an identity thief might have taken it from your mailbox. And if it’s been a while since you’ve seen a statement, they may have changed the address it gets sent to altogether.

When this happens, contact your card issuer to make sure they’re still sending the bill to the correct address.
<h4>3. Debt collectors harass you for accounts you didn’t open.</h4>
Getting a call from a debt collector for an account you never opened could be a sign that your identity was stolen several months ago.

Tell the collector the account isn’t yours. Let them know they shouldn’t contact you anymore, either.

Check your credit report for the account in question. If you see it or any other suspicious accounts, put a fraud alert on your report. You can also set a security freeze on it to keep new accounts from being opened in your name.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. You’re denied for a loan or credit card.</h4>
Getting denied for credit or a loan isn’t suspicious in itself. If you were expecting approval, however, you’ll want to find out exactly why you were rejected.

The creditor or lender must tell you. If the reason sounds suspicious, check your credit report to ensure it wasn’t due to identity theft that’s been damaging your score unbeknownst to you.
<h4>5. You can’t find your credit card.</h4>
The minute you cannot find your card, you should report it lost or stolen. This can keep someone else from running up charges on it that could ruin your credit later on.

Even if you just lost it or misplaced it somewhere in your home, your best bet is always to contact the issuer as a precaution until you know for sure what happened to the card.","Your identity may have been stolen without you even knowing it.

177,"7 Quick Hacks To Boost Your Credit Score","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The higher your credit score, the better your chances of getting loans and credit cards with affordable interest rates.

While your credit score may seem low now, there are moves you can make to improve it in the future. Here they are:

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Check your free credit report.</h4>
As scary as it may be, you have to check your credit once a year to know where you truly stand. You can now do it for free on an annual basis, so excuses about extra costs don’t fly here.

Once you have your free report in hand, you can make the rest of the credit score-boosting moves in this list.
<h4>2. Dispute negative information that’s old.</h4>
Past mistakes don’t have to ruin your credit forever. Once seven years pass, most negative information such as late payments or collections should disappear.

What can stay on your report past seven years? Things like bankruptcies or tax liens if you live in California. Beyond that, however, file a credit report dispute to remove the old information so you can increase your score.
<h4>3. Do a “pay for delete.”</h4>
If you’ve recently come into cash and want to put it to good use, you can clean up your credit report by doing a pay for delete.

This involves asking a creditor to delete an account from your report once you’ve paid the past due balance in full.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>4. Prioritize which accounts to pay down.</h4>
You want to avoid having accounts that are almost at their limit. The more available credit you use, the higher your credit utilization ratio, which makes up 30 percent of your score.

Look for the highest account balances that are closest to their limits. These are the ones you’ll want to pay down first after any past due balances are taken care of. By doing this, you can lower your utilization ratio to better your score.
<h4>5. Get some positive history by getting a new card.</h4>
Once your accounts are under control, you may want to build some positive credit history from scratch. You can do this by getting a new credit card.

If your credit score prevents you from getting approved, you can opt for a secured credit card or one that exists explicitly for people with bad credit.

Once open, be sure to keep your utilization ratio low (10 percent is great, 30 percent is good) and make payments on time.
<h4>6. Write a goodwill letter.</h4>
Do you have negative accounts that you paid off? You may get them removed by writing a goodwill letter to the creditor.

A goodwill letter asks the creditor to remove a paid, negative account so you can improve your score. To increase your chances of succeeding here, try writing the message to a specific person within the company.

183,"Is Having No Credit Score Or History A Bad Thing?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

But what about having no credit score at all? Is that equally as bad? Keep reading to find out.

Some people never check their credit score because they know they’ve missed payments and figure it’s probably low. If this sounds like you, combat that fear by getting your free annual credit report now.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

By seeing your credit history and score, you’ll be able to tell if any errors should be removed to improve your score. You can also see which past mistakes you should avoid in the future. Last, but not least, you can tell if you’ve been a victim of identity theft.

What’s another reason you may not take advantage of your free credit report? The fact that you have no credit history at all.

While having a poor credit history is less than ideal, let’s take a look at how having no evidence of past credit can affect you.
<h4>Two Reasons Why You May Have No Credit Score</h4>
Not having a credit score means you fall into one of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>You never applied for credit cards or a loan in the past.</li>
 	<li>You have no recent credit history.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

It makes sense that if you’ve never applied for any form of credit in the past that you’d have no score or history. This is common for young people, as they may not give creditors any activity they can use to calculate a score.

On the other end of the spectrum is not having a score due to no recent history. Sure, you may have had credit cards and loans in the past, but if you’ve been dormant for the last 7-10 years, you may have a history, but no score.

Is there a specific cutoff date where your credit score will disappear? No, as there are several factors that go into it. The average range, however, is 7-10 years.

Having no score makes you “credit invisible.” How many people fall into this category? About 10 percent, as reported by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2016.
<h4>The Effects of Having No Credit Score</h4>
While no credit isn’t necessarily as bad as having poor credit, it can make it tough to get approved for a loan or card.

Being credit invisible doesn’t necessarily label you as a bad borrower, but rather a mysterious one that some creditors may not want to associate with.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Build Your Credit History</h4>
You can start building your credit history by doing the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Opening a student or secured credit card.</li>
 	<li>Opening a store credit card.</li>
 	<li>Becoming an authorized user on someone else’s card.</li>
 	<li>Using a cosigner to get a loan or credit card.</li>
 	<li>Report your utility payment and rent history to the credit bureaus.</li>
 	<li>Finance an expensive item, such as an appliance or furniture, with a store.</li>
 	<li>Get a credit-builder loan.</li>
</ul>
When making any of the above moves, be sure to read the fine print, so you don’t get hit with high fees or interest rates that put you in a hole that’s hard to get out of.","You probably know that bad credit history is something you should avoid.","2020-08-10 05:21:46",post,https://section8assist.com/is-having-no-credit-score-or-history-a-bad-thing/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_495704656.jpg,shutterstock_495704656.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_495704656.jpg,185,shutterstock_495704656,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_495704656.jpg,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,is-having-no-credit-score-or-history-a-bad-thing,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 19:03:25"
188,"7 Tips To Cut Your Home’s Cooling Costs","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

You don’t have to sacrifice comfort to lower your cooling costs so you can <a href=""https://section8assist.com/how-to-find-utility-assistance-in-your-state/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">see a smaller utility bill</a>. You just have to make these money-saving moves:
<h4>1. Use fans.</h4>
According to the Consumer Energy Center of California, sitting in front of a fan can make you feel four degrees (Fahrenheit) cooler. While that’s good to know, it’s also great news that fans can be less costly than an air conditioner.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Not only can fans cost less to purchase or fix, but they can also cost less to run.

Set up several fans in your home, and you should feel it cool down without getting sticker shock from your electricity bill.

To keep your bill as low as possible, be sure to turn off any fans in unoccupied rooms.
<h4>2. Layer down.</h4>
While adding layers to your clothing during the winter can keep you warm, the opposite is true during warmer months.

The less clothing you wear around the house, the cooler it will be, making you rely on the AC unit less.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Close the curtains.</h4>
Sunlight can heat your home quickly. The more you can keep out, the more refreshing and comfortable your house will feel inside.

How much heat can keeping the curtains open add to a house? According to some, as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

That’s a huge difference that can put a burden on your cooling system, so keep those curtains closed as much as possible.
<h4>4. Avoid the oven.</h4>
Using the oven to cook can spread excess heat to the rest of your home.

Instead of the oven, try cooking on the grill outdoors or use the microwave. A slow cooker will suffice as well.

If you use the stove, be sure to turn a fan on to blow out any hot air.
<h4>5. Avoid incandescent light bulbs.</h4>
These old fashioned forms of lighting produce more heat than light. By replacing them with longer-lasting and more energy-efficient LED or compact fluorescent bulbs, you can keep your home cooler without being in the dark.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Seal gaps around doors and windows.</h4>
You want to keep as much cold air in your home as possible. The more that escapes, the more your AC will have to work overtime to maintain a lower temperature.

Look around your home. If you see any windows or doors that have gaps near the frames, seal them with weather stripping or caulk to keep cold air from escaping.

As a bonus, doing this will also help during the winter if it gets cold where you live. Outdoor cold air will be blocked from coming indoors, which could cause you to run up heating costs.
<h4>7. Use a programmable thermostat.</h4>
While installing a programmable thermostat will have an upfront cost, it can save you money in the long run.

Buy one that lets you set a schedule. For example, when you’re not home and working or running errands, you can set the thermostat at a higher temperature. Once back, it can be lowered to keep you cool.","Air conditioning can take a big chunk of your monthly budget.

193,"4 Steps To Determine Section 8 Housing Assistance Eligibility","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If these trying times have you looking for housing assistance, here are the eligibility basics on what it takes to secure a voucher.

Many states have put a temporary stop to evictions due to lost jobs and income from the COVID-19 outbreak. While this may give you some time to organize your finances, what happens once everything goes back to normal? Getting a new job or replacing lost income may not be that simple, which is why a Section 8 voucher could come in handy.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since Housing Choice Vouchers can take a long time to process, there’s no better time than now to get acquainted with the program. But instead of discussing what it takes to apply, let’s focus on the requirements to be eligible for Section 8, broken down into four simple steps.
<h4>1. Check that you meet the essential Section 8 eligibility requirements.</h4>
To be eligible for Section 8 housing assistance, you must be:
<ul>
 	<li>At least 18 years of age.</li>
 	<li>A U.S. citizen (or noncitizen with eligible immigration status).</li>
</ul>
What qualifies as eligible immigration status? Any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Lawful permanent resident</li>
 	<li>Resident of Guam, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, or Palau</li>
 	<li>Refugee/asylee</li>
 	<li>Victim or relative of a trafficking victim</li>
 	<li>Registry immigrant</li>
 	<li>Parolee</li>
 	<li>Conditional entrant</li>
 	<li>Person given 1986 amnesty status</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Confirm that you meet the household income requirements.</h4>
The basic rule when it comes to income is that your household must earn less than half of the Area Median Income (AMI) of where you are applying to live.

Gross income (what you receive before taxes and expenses) is used for the calculation. This income limit increases according to the number of people living in your household. Income from the employment of household members under the age of 18 is not included.

You can find income limits in your area by going <a href=""https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html"">here</a>. You can also get them by contacting your local housing office.
<h4>3. Identify any qualifying preferences your household may have.</h4>
Section 8 vouchers have waiting lists that can be quite long. You can move up the list faster than others if you have preferences that apply to your situation, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Being a local resident.</li>
 	<li>Having a household member who is elderly or with disabilities.</li>
 	<li>Being homeless or living in substandard housing.</li>
</ul>
Some waiting lists may be open only to those with such preferences. If these restrictions are in place, you may want to ask for placement on another list to accelerate the process.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Beware of disqualifying factors.</h4>
The housing agency may reject a voucher application if any of the following apply to you or any household member seeking Section 8 assistance:
<ul>
 	<li>Eviction from HUD housing within the last five years.</li>
 	<li>Money owed to a housing authority.</li>
 	<li>Termination of assistance by a housing authority for any reason.</li>
</ul>
Felons with offenses related to drugs, alcohol abuse, or violence may have a harder time getting accepted into Section 8. If a person was evicted from public housing within the past three years for a drug-related offense, they will likely be denied.

If you feel that your household doesn’t meet every single Section 8 requirement, contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) before giving up. They may be able to help you kickstart the application process, even if your situation isn’t 100 percent ideal.","A Housing Choice Voucher from the government’s Section 8 program could help keep a roof over your family’s head.","2020-08-10 09:27:21",post,https://section8assist.com/4-steps-to-determine-section-8-housing-assistance-eligibility/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144782404.jpg,shutterstock_144782404.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144782404.jpg,195,shutterstock_144782404,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_144782404.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,4-steps-to-determine-section-8-housing-assistance-eligibility,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:50:48"
198,"How To Receive Food Assistance","Staying healthy is a pressing concern for many families across the United States. To achieve this goal, they have access to a variety of federal programs designed to help them with their food expenses. 

[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides assistance for low-income families to purchase food and other household supplies.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Originally named Food Stamp Plan, it was created in 1939 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “New Deal” set of reforms designed to combat the Great Depression. Henry Wallace, who served as Vice President and Secretary of Agriculture under Roosevelt, is thought by many to have done the most to bring about the program.</span>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SNAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under the agency of Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). It benefits more than 44 million Americans who receive at least $100 a month in assistance to buy food and household supplies. In this guide, we offer information about the program, what is required to qualify, and how to apply to receive the benefits.</span>

<strong>How to Qualify for SNAP</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SNAP offers financial assistance to low-income families nationwide. As a result, the eligibility of a family is determined by the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG). As of 2018, these guidelines establish $12,140 a year as the minimum income for a single-person to be above the poverty level in most states.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To receive the benefits of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a family needs to certify that their gross annual income falls below 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). This means that they do not have to be “in poverty” to be eligible for food assistance. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) does not count money received as part of any other assistance program towards the income calculation.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to the income criteria, families must have less than $2,250 in assets to qualify. This number grows to $3,500 if the household includes an elderly or disabled person. However, it does not include the value of the family’s home, up to one vehicle, and other exonerated assets such as household goods and personal effects.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<strong>How to Apply for SNAP</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low-income families that are eligible for food assistance can submit an application to any of the local SNAP offices located in their state. The application can be submitted online, by mail or in person. Which methods are available vary state by state. Regardless, all state offices will ask families to provide documents that certify their eligibility, such as proof of income or employment.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Submitting a SNAP application online will usually require the creation of an account on the state office’s website. This generally gives the families access to additional benefits, allowing them to undertake other SNAP-related activities from their home, such as keeping track of their applications or submitting new documents.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is possible in all states to send the application by mail. Using this method can be comfortable for families with no computer or internet access. Households should call their local SNAP office before submitting their application to make sure they send the documents to the correct mailing address.</span>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A mandatory interview with a SNAP representative to review the documents and certify the eligibility must take place before the process is complete. Therefore, it is recommended that families take a trip to the local SNAP office and become familiar with the personnel. Two trips would have to be made to the local office to submit an application in person: one to ask for information and guidance and another one for the mandatory interview. However, this can be best method for elderly and disabled citizens, who can receive assistance and get their application approved as fast as possible.</span>",,"2020-08-10 09:32:17",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-receive-food-assistance/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_313061147.jpg,shutterstock_313061147.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_313061147.jpg,200,shutterstock_313061147,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_313061147.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-receive-food-assistance,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:50:52"
204,"Frequently Asked Questions On Section 8 Housing Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’ve never applied for Section 8 housing assistance before, now’s the time to get familiar with the program, especially if you see tough times ahead. To help you achieve that goal, here are some basic questions and answers on how Housing Choice Vouchers work.
<h4>How much is a Section 8 voucher worth?</h4>
That depends on the location of the housing. On average, a Section 8 tenant will be expected to pay 30 percent of their monthly income towards the rent. The remainder will be paid by the local Public Housing Agency (PHA) directly to the landlord.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

In some cases, tenants may find housing that exceeds the PHA’s “payment standard” and be more expensive than recommended. If so, the tenant may end up paying up to 40 percent of their income towards the rent.

By keeping the vast majority of income in your pocket, you can see how a Section 8 voucher could keep you afloat if tough times arise once again.
<h4>Is everyone eligible for Section 8?</h4>
No, as Section 8 is mostly intended for low-income families that fit basic criteria, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Being 18 years of age or older.</li>
 	<li>Being U.S. citizens or non-citizens with eligible immigration status.</li>
 	<li>Earning below 50 percent of the median income for an area.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is Section 8 a form of emergency rental assistance?</h4>
No, as the process can take years to complete, depending on the demand for housing. In other words, if you're looking for immediate housing help due to the coronavirus, you'll need to seek other options.

Section 8 is, however, a solid solution for long-term rental assistance that can keep your family in safe, affordable housing into the future.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Are Section 8 vouchers limited to one location? Can they be moved?</h4>
While some PHAs may require Section 8 tenants to remain in an area’s housing for one year, they usually allow for the “portability” of vouchers to other locations after that period passes.
<h4>Are Housing Choice Vouchers transferable to other people?</h4>
While they can be transferred to new locations when a family wants to move after a particular time, Section 8 vouchers are not transferable between people unless the head of the household dies.
<h4>Do vouchers have deadlines for when they must be used by?</h4>
Yes, but a voucher recipient usually has at least 60 days to find housing. If an extension is needed, it will be up to the PHA to allow it.
<h4>Do Housing Choice Vouchers expire?</h4>
As long as the household is living in an approved Section 8 unit, in good standing with the PHA, and still eligible for the program, they can continue to receive housing assistance with no expiration date.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Can you use a Section 8 voucher to pay rent in any dwelling you choose?</h4>
No, as it must adhere to the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards to ensure it’s safe and up to code.

Will finding a home before you get your voucher lead to quicker approval?

No, as you will have to remain on the waiting list before you can get a voucher to use towards rent. While on the waiting list, you can search for Section 8 housing to be prepared to move when the time comes, however.
<h4>How can you apply for Section 8?</h4>
You can begin the process by <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"">going here</a> to locate your PHA and contacting them.","Has the economic impact of COVID-19 opened your eyes to the importance of cutting costs?

209,"Rental Assistance For Seniors, Best Resources","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Paying for housing can feel impossible for a senior who is trying to live on a modest, fixed income.

If this sounds like your situation, you’re not alone, as the National Council on Aging estimates that over 25 million people aged 60 or older were “economically insecure.” This status reflects those living on less than $31,225 in annual income.

While increasing your income may be difficult as a senior, getting rental assistance to make your situation more manageable can help.

Here are two popular forms of rental assistance the government has created to help seniors with housing.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8)</h4>
You’ve probably heard of the Section 8 program before, and while it's now formally referred to as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, it still offers housing assistance to those in need, including seniors.

Getting a Housing Choice Voucher is ideal for a senior who still wants to live independently in their own home. It does not limit them to a single-family home, either, as they can use their voucher towards rent in an apartment or townhome as well, as long as it meets the HUD’s requirements.

To be eligible for Section 8, you’ll need to:
<ul>
 	<li>Be over 18.</li>
 	<li>Be a U.S. citizen or possess eligible immigration status.</li>
 	<li>Have an income that doesn’t exceed 50 percent of the median income for the area you want to live in.</li>
 	<li>Pass a background check.</li>
</ul>
Although those requirements may differ according to location, they’re standard and give you an idea of what’s needed to qualify for Section 8.

If you qualify, you will have to pay 30 percent of your income towards the rent. The HUD will pay the rest directly to your landlord.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Section 8 is an excellent option for seniors seeking rental assistance, but its downside is demand. Some who qualify may sit on a waitlist for years before receiving a voucher.

To apply for a Housing Choice Voucher, go here to contact your local Public Housing Agency.
<h4>The Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program (Section 202)</h4>
As mentioned, Section 8 is geared more towards the senior who wants to live on their own. Section 202, on the other hand, is a better fit for someone seeking assisted living.

Like Section 8, Section 202 is run by the HUD. To provide assisted living for seniors, this rental and housing assistance program offers the following, depending on location:
<ul>
 	<li>Housing specifically equipped for seniors with ramps, grab rails, and wheelchair-accessible features.</li>
 	<li>Social spaces where seniors can interact with others, plus daily activities.</li>
 	<li>Assistance with medications, meals, bathing, and more.</li>
 	<li>Transportation services.</li>
 	<li>On-site care coordinators.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

A senior who qualifies for Section 202 housing can gain significant rental assistance. As with Section 8, they will be expected to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. The HUD will pick up the rest of the tab.

As a freelancer, you’ll be bidding versus others to secure clients from around the world. You can either get one-time gigs or form relationships that will turn into long-term, well-paying positions that can last years.
<h4>3. Fiverr</h4>
Don’t let Fiverr’s name scare you. While it does have gigs that pay $5 a pop, you can also find jobs for much more. Start building money-making momentum as a Fiverr freelancer, and any negative memories of losing your regular job due to COVID-19 will soon disappear.

219,"How To Calculate Your Wait Time For A Section 8 Housing Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

A common misconception about Section 8 and housing vouchers is that it’s a quick form of rental assistance. Many believe that when they can’t pay the rent due to an emergency that Section 8 can come in and save the day.

Unfortunately, that’s not true due to one critical factor: time. Section 8 is not emergency rental assistance since it can take a ton of time to receive your housing voucher. So if you’re nearing eviction due to a lack of rent money, it’s best to look elsewhere for that short term solution.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

On the flip side, housing vouchers can be an excellent long-term solution for rental assistance. If you’re consistently having trouble making the rent, a monthly voucher can change that by covering part of your payment.

With that being said, let’s tackle the task of trying to decipher just how long you’ll be on a Section 8 waiting list. Although we won’t be able to give a precise answer since it varies due to your Public Housing Agency (PHA), we will at least look at the basics of how waiting lists work.
<h4>The Waiting List Process</h4>
After you complete your Section 8 application and submit it, you will have to wait for the approval. This wait will vary according to your PHA, but the standard is somewhere between a couple of weeks to a couple of months.

Your PHA may give you various options to apply. If the online option is available, take it over a paper application, as it can take less time to process.

If your application is approved, you will get a spot on the waiting list. This notification often comes via email or a letter. If you do not get placed on a waiting list, you may receive no warning at all. Again, this will depend on your PHA’s procedures.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

A waiting list’s order can be determined chronologically, or randomly via a lottery. Once you have your spot, you’ll want to keep it. This is why paying attention to any notifications or requests for information is crucial. If you don’t respond to a request, you may lose your spot.

It’s also important to note any changes to your situation. If your income or family composition changes, contact your PHA so they can make the adjustments. Keeping your contact information up-to-date is also a must, just in case they need to contact you.
<h4>Waiting List Times</h4>
The higher the population in your area, the longer the wait time for a housing voucher. There may be exceptions to this, but that’s usually how it works.

You may be on a Section 8 waiting list for several years. You can narrow down this timeframe by asking your PHA for an estimate, or you can look at its “Annual Plan” to calculate it yourself.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Calculating Your Section 8 Waiting Time</h4>
The Annual Plan can tell you how many people are on the waiting list, plus the annual turnover rate. The turnover rate describes how many vouchers are awarded per year.

Here’s an example if your area has 500 households on the waiting list with an annual turnover rate of 100:

500/100 = 5 years.

Yes, you would have to wait approximately five years to get your housing voucher in this case, which shows why Section 8 is not a form of emergency rental assistance.

If you’re confused or unsure of how long your wait for a voucher is, contact your PHA so they can point you in the right direction.","The time it takes to receive your voucher can vary significantly. Here are some tips on how to calculate the wait.","2021-08-01 07:45:34",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-calculate-your-wait-time-for-a-section-8-housing-voucher/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1165523350.jpg,shutterstock_1165523350.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1165523350.jpg,221,shutterstock_1165523350,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1165523350.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-calculate-your-wait-time-for-a-section-8-housing-voucher,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 03:25:42"
224,"Make Cash at Home With Online Survey Sites","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->
Can you get rich by simply filling out surveys online? Probably not. Does this mean you should shun online survey sites? Not if you’d like to <a href=""https://section8assist.com/35-tasks-you-can-complete-for-additional-income/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">earn some extra cash or gift cards on the side</a>.

Before we jump into tips on making money with survey sites, it’s worth noting that you should look at them as entertainment instead of work. Will it take some time to start earning? Sure, but many survey sites’ activities are fun and not tiring.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Whether you’re a college student or a single parent seeking a side income, or just someone who loves to give their opinion, you can use these sites to fulfill those desires. Just know that you won’t be quitting your day job in the process.
<h4>1. Make a separate email address solely for survey sites</h4>
You probably don’t want to receive loads of survey emails to your personal or work inbox. Since many of these sites send you emails when a survey becomes available, you could clog up your inbox quickly. For this reason, it’s best to create a brand new email address for your survey side gig.

Gmail is free and easy to use. Once you have your new address created, you can proceed to the next step.
<h4>2. Sign up to legitimate survey sites simultaneously</h4>
Your second key to success with online surveys is to use legitimate sites. What makes a site legitimate? One that allows you to earn without compromising your personal information.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Here are four such sites:
<ul>
 	<li>MyPointsInboxDollars</li>
 	<li>Survey Junkie</li>
 	<li>CashKarma</li>
</ul>
To get the most bang for your survey-filling buck, sign up to those four sites at once. Each will have their own availability, so you want to be able to have the most shots at completing surveys as possible.
<h4>3. Never pay to play.</h4>
The whole point of joining survey sites is to rake in extra cash. If a website asks for money before you can make any, stay away.

The four sites above are well-known in the online survey arena. Start with them, and you should have more than enough opportunities to earn without having to worry about places that will try to scam you.
<h4>4. Keep your banking info to yourself.</h4>
Legit survey sites pay via checks in the mail, gift cards, or through PayPal. As such, you should never have to enter your banking information to get paid. If you do, you could have issues down the line.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Save time with Roboform.</h4>
If you get super serious about your survey side gig, you may want to use a program like Roboform to help you save time.

With many sites/surveys, you’ll be filling out the same information over and over again. Roboform can remember such details and fill it out for you, making form-filling a breeze.
<h4>6. Be broad in your responses.</h4>
When filling out forms or profiles, try to make yourself seem like a viable candidate for as many surveys as possible. You can do this by being more broad than specific with your answers.

The more varied your profile, the more opportunities you can receive to rake in the dough.","Despite their reputation, you can make money with online survey sites.

229,"Eligibility and Money, Recent Changes to Housing Program Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here are some things you should know before you start looking at properties.

Once you have a Housing Choice Voucher, can you do whatever you want with it? Unfortunately, no, as your Public Housing Agency (PHA) has specific guidelines you must abide by when finding a home.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since the PHA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are providing some of the monthly rent, they have the final say in what’s acceptable housing. This can restrict your housing search a bit, which is why it’s best to know what’s expected before you begin.

Although you will have some work ahead of you, know that the hardest part of the Section 8 application process – sitting on the long waiting list – is now over.
<h4>Is there a monthly rent restriction when picking a Section 8 home?</h4>
Yes, and it is known as the Payment Standard. The PHA uses this to determine what reasonable rent is for your location. You will have to use the Payment Standard as a guide if you don’t want to be stuck paying a ton of rent out of pocket.

If the rent is too high, any excess beyond the housing voucher value will have to be covered by you. Choosing a property with high rent could land you in financial trouble if you cannot cover your end.

Contact your PHA to see what the Payment Standard is where you live. It’s essential to know this amount before you begin your search, as you can use it as a guide to narrow down properties that interest you.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Can you pick any Section 8 home you desire?</h4>
While the Payment Standard limits how much rent will be paid by the voucher, the Housing Quality Standards (HQS) also restrict your choices. These standards are used to ensure that the home you pick is safe and efficient.

For example, if a home you like is missing smoke detectors, has issues with water availability, or lacks proper indoor air quality, it may not pass the HQS test. In short, you won’t be able to use your voucher towards the rent there.

To determine HQS eligibility, the home will have to be inspected. If it passes, you can then move one step closer to moving into your Section 8 rental.
<h4>Must every landlord accept Section 8 vouchers?</h4>
No, unless they are located in certain parts of the country. For example, these states have anti-discrimination laws that protect Section 8 users:
<ul>
 	<li>Washington D.C.</li>
 	<li>Washington</li>
 	<li>Vermont</li>
 	<li>Utah</li>
 	<li>Oregon</li>
 	<li>Oklahoma</li>
 	<li>North Dakota</li>
 	<li>New York</li>
 	<li>New Jersey</li>
 	<li>Massachusetts</li>
 	<li>Maine</li>
 	<li>Connecticut</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

There are also some cities and counties that offer similar protection. To find out where your voucher must be accepted, contact your PHA.
<h4>How can you find Section 8 housing?</h4>
There are plenty of sites that will let you look for Section 8 rentals online. You can also ask your PHA for a contact list of landlords that are housing voucher-friendly.","Searching for an affordable Section 8 home can be exciting once your housing voucher is in place.","2021-08-01 07:35:06",post,https://section8assist.com/eligibility-and-money-recent-changes-to-housing-program-voucher/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1089163904.jpg,shutterstock_1089163904.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1089163904.jpg,231,shutterstock_1089163904,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1089163904.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,eligibility-and-money-recent-changes-to-housing-program-voucher,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-09 13:59:26"
234,"How To Get Additional Food Assistance During COVID-19","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Keep reading to see different ways you can get additional food assistance during the coronavirus outbreak.

Once news of the coronavirus and possible shutdowns hit, you probably went to the store and stocked up on food for your family. Once those shutdowns spread, however, you’re stockpiling may have stopped if your income was negatively impacted.

In response to the crisis, several organizations have stepped up to provide COVID-19 food assistance. While your mileage may vary according to location, this list should help open your eyes as to the opportunities that exist.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>211.org</h4>
The fact that you can get emergency assistance via 911 is probably etched into your brain. But did you know you can find other forms of assistance by calling 211? You sure can, and it’s a number that can come in handy until things get back to normal.

When it comes to food, contacting 211 can connect you to information on where to find food distribution sites and food pantries in your area.

Besides dialing 211, you can find your “local 211” by <a href=""http://www.211.org/services/covid19"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">going here</a> and entering your city and zip code or state into the fields at the top of the page.

You’ll also find a wide variety of resources available to those in need besides food assistance, such as help with unemployment benefits, low-cost home Internet access, health insurance and medical expenses, rental and mortgage payment assistance, and more.
<h4>The Benefits.gov Website</h4>
Most states have their own programs that offer food assistance in times of crisis like this and throughout the year. You can <a href=""https://www.benefits.gov/categories/Food%20and%20Nutrition"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">find programs available in your state</a> by visiting this link where you can filter the results by location to pinpoint what you need.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

As an example, you may find information on your state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which was formerly referred to as food stamps. You may also find information on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

The federal government has eased requirements for such programs to make it easier to receive their benefits in these tough times. In other words, if you had problems qualifying before, check to see if you’re eligible now.

One way in which qualifying has become easier is you no longer have to enroll in person. It can now be done remotely, which is quicker, more convenient, and safer. Another is that the USDA recently waived requirements for children to be present when parents pick up meals.
<h4>Local Schools</h4>
While most schools across the country have closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, their food services have continued to allow local children to receive free meals.

Contact your child’s school to see if they are offering free meals that you can pick up.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>State Social Services</h4>
Another place where you may want to check for food assistance is through your state’s social services agency. To find yours, go <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.
<h4>The USA.gov Website</h4>

239,"Buying A New Car Versus Buying A Used Car","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If so, we’ll break down the benefits of each to help you make that decision.

Before you start shopping for a car, there’s an important choice you need to make, and that’s whether the car should be new or used. By picking one before your search, you can make it much easier to pinpoint your next vehicle.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

What should you consider when comparing new versus used cars? Let’s have a look.
<h3>New Car Benefits</h3>
<h4>More Customization and Newer Features</h4>
When buying a brand new car, you have a lot more options when it comes to customization, so you can get the perfect vehicle to match your needs and desires.

At the dealership, you can choose the car’s exterior and interior colors, plus any other custom features that will be limited if you take the used car route.

The newer the car, the better the technology, too, with features such as adaptive cruise control or lane-change warnings that can make it safer to drive.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Warranty Coverage and Lower Repair Costs</h4>
If you’ve ever driven a used car with many miles/years on it, you know that it can lead to worry when it comes to unexpected repairs and maintenance. If the engine or transmission fails, you could be looking at repair costs worth thousands of dollars.

With a new car, you shouldn’t have this problem thanks to a warranty that can keep you covered. This peace of mind that comes with new vehicles may be their most popular feature, beyond new technology or that “new car smell.”
<h4>Better Financing Offers</h4>
Depending on your credit, you could enjoy financial incentives for buying a new car, such as zero-percent financing or cash back. Either could lower your upfront costs to get into a new ride.

Beyond incentives, new car loans often have lower interest rates than used ones. Score another point here for the new car crew.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>A Quicker Purchase</h4>
As mentioned, you can customize a new car to fit precisely what you want and need right from the dealer. With a used car, you may have to search a while to find a precise fit, especially if you’re picky about color, engine features, etc.
<h3>Used Car Benefits</h3>
<h4>More Affordable</h4>
Depreciation is your friend when buying a used car, as it can help you score a reasonably new vehicle at a much lower cost. Some cars lose one-fifth of their value or more in their first year, so waiting a bit to get that desired car in its used state could result in significant savings.

The price of a used car isn’t the only financial feature that may be more affordable, as you may save on insurance too. Since less-expensive cars usually cost less to insure, you can keep more money in your pocket every month by going used.

While it may seem like new cars have a lot more benefits in their favor, it all depends on your situation. Regardless of which route you choose, be sure to shop around, do your research, and, as always, read the fine print before signing on that dotted line.","Are you in the market for a car, but don’t know if it’s better to buy it new or used?

244,"Your Guide To Financial Recovery After COVID-19","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

This is your quick guide to doing so, no matter how bad it seems right now.

It can be hard to look for silver linings when you’ve been stuck inside for so long, and this is even more true if you’ve lost your job or significant income due to the coronavirus. One positive, however, could be that this is a wakeup call to make better use of your time and money in case a similar crisis appears in the years to come.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are some tips you can follow to get back on your feet and ensure your family’s future is financially secure:
<h4>1. Get benefits related to the coronavirus outbreak.</h4>
The federal government took action to help people stay afloat during shutdowns in the form of stimulus checks and beefed-up unemployment benefits.

Stimulus checks under the CARES Act provide $1,200 to single adults with an adjusted gross income below $75,000. Married couples without children who earn less than $150,000 combined get $2,400. Qualifying children under the age of 16, meanwhile, can add $500 each to the check amounts.

You can still get stimulus checks for less than $1,200 if you are a single person who makes up to $99,000. A married couple without children can make up to $198,000 to still qualify for a smaller check.

The IRS will use your 2018 or 2019 tax filings to distribute these funds, so as long as you filed, you don’t have to do anything to receive it.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Beyond stimulus checks, you may also collect unemployment benefits from your state, plus $600 weekly if you lost your job, were furloughed, or quarantined due to the coronavirus.

<h4>2. Cut the fat from your budget.</h4>
Qualifying for coronavirus stimulus checks or unemployment benefits can help you stay on your feet during these tough times. To stretch that income or any savings you currently have, it’s best to eliminate unnecessary expenses such as eating (or now, ordering) out, monthly subscription services, and more.
<h4>3. Try to live within your means.</h4>
Do you now feel like you’re paying too much for your car? Is your rent or mortgage way out of your league due to COVID-19 job or income loss? If so, you may want to downgrade your car, home, or any other bill that you know will be tough to pay.

Downsizing or downgrading may be a tough pill to swallow, but being able to meet your monthly budget is better than worrying about how you’ll make payments on time.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Start building your emergency fund.</h4>
If you can, use some of your stimulus check to start stashing away money for a rainy day. As burdensome or boring as it may be to build an emergency fund, it can keep you from using credit cards or going into debt when tough times arise. And that can save you from financial ruin in the future.
<h4>5. Take an intense look at your employment/career.</h4>
There’s nothing worse than being told you can’t work because you’re “non-essential.” You may want to take this time to reevaluate your career and enter something new that not only pays more, but is also in high demand.

If you are satisfied with your position, you may be able to leverage this current climate into a more favorable working condition.

For instance, you could ask to start working from home more often, which can help you cut transportation or even childcare costs. Or, if you’ve stuck around while others decided to quit, you could leverage your loyalty into a raise or a promotion to boost your present and future finances.
<h4>6. Learn from this experience.</h4>
The coronavirus pandemic has been tough on most of the world. Take it as a learning experience to see where your financial weaknesses are.

Do you need to save more? Have you found that expensive material things aren’t that important? Regardless of the lesson learned, use it to your advantage should another crisis appear somewhere down the line.","While the economic impact of COVID-19 has been catastrophic, there are ways to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and build a better financial future.","2020-08-10 05:44:16",post,https://section8assist.com/your-guide-to-financial-recovery-after-covid-19/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1704130414.jpg,shutterstock_1704130414.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1704130414.jpg,246,shutterstock_1704130414,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1704130414.jpg,"Work From Home","Debt Help",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,your-guide-to-financial-recovery-after-covid-19,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 19:00:44"

<h4>Step 1 – Developing Your Case for Telecommuting</h4>
As mentioned, there’s no better time than now to ask for a work-from-home setup. Even though many companies made the temporary move to let their employees work remotely, many have seen the cost-cutting benefits associated with telecommuting. As such, your boss may be more receptive to such a request than they may have been in the past.

Asking your boss to give the okay on working from home could be done casually, but it’s much better done professionally. That means doing research and presenting your arguments in a presentation that’s statistically backed. Luckily, with the Internet at your disposal, this is easier than it sounds.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Some things you may want to include in your presentation could be statistics or evidence on:
<ul>
 	<li>How businesses have benefitted from work-from-home arrangements.</li>
 	<li>How employee productivity increases when telecommuting.</li>
 	<li>The financial savings companies can enjoy by eliminating office costs through remote work.</li>
 	<li>The best policies/procedures for working from home that benefit both the employee and employer.</li>
</ul>
Gather all of your findings in a PowerPoint presentation, and your boss will have a harder time rejecting your request.
<h4>Step 2 – Showing Why You Deserve to Telecommute</h4>
An employer isn’t likely to let just any employee work from home, especially if they have a poor track record. An employee who has shown to be trustworthy, dependable, and always on time, however, could be the perfect remote work candidate.

It’s your job to showcase these characteristics by providing specific examples related to your history with the company. Promotions, positive evaluations, and more can provide a solid argument as to why your boss should trust you when working at a distance.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Step 3 – Detailing Your Reasons for Working From Home</h4>
Do you know you can be more productive working in your pajamas? Do you feel like you can be a better company asset by eliminating a long, tiring commute every day? Here is where you have to come up with reasons why remote work benefits your boss and makes you even more valuable to the organization.

You can make this part of your argument stronger by presenting a sample schedule of what your typical days would look like. The more detailed visual you can provide of how such a setup would work, the better your chances of being approved as a remote work candidate.
<h4>Step 4 – Making Your Request via a Risk-Free Trial Run</h4>
You don’t want to pressure your employer into making a long-term commitment. If you do, they may say no.

To alleviate the pressure, ask for a test run so you can see how telecommuting works. If both parties are happy once the trial run is finished, you can move to a more permanent agreement. If not, you can return to regular office work.","Your chances of convincing your boss to let you work from home are now higher than ever.

Are you one of the millions of people who lost their jobs and saw their income destroyed due to COVID-19? If so, this has probably caused loads of concern when it comes to money and paying your bills. And if you have student loan debt, you may be wondering how you’ll ever pay it off right now.

Luckily, the government has stepped in to give some student loan borrowers relief, at least temporarily, with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

We’ll discuss what type of loans are eligible for relief, the benefits involved, and what you can do if you’re not covered and are worried about ruining your credit.
<h4>Student Loan Relief From the CARES Act</h4>
The CARES Act became official on March 27. It was put together to offer financial relief to those negatively impacted by the coronavirus and all of its shutdowns. While you may know about the CARES Act mostly due to its hefty $600 per week unemployment benefits and $1,200 stimulus checks, it also addressed the issue of student loan debt.

Learning that the CARES Act covers student loans is excellent news, but it comes with a pretty big asterisk. Unfortunately, all student loans are not included. Only those held by the government are eligible for relief, and they must be provided or guaranteed through the U.S. Department of Education.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>CARES Act Benefits for Qualifying Student Loans</h4>
There are two significant benefits that the CARES Act provides for holders of federal student loans. The first is that no payments will be necessary between March 13, 2020, and September 30, 2020. The second is that there will be zero interest during this period as well.
<h4>Student Loans That Qualify for CARES Act relief</h4>
As mentioned, a student loan will have to be provided or guaranteed through the Department of Education. This covers direct loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Perkins loans.

Once you have confirmed that your loan meets those requirements, you do not have to take any action to enjoy the zero-interest loan deferral benefits. Your loan provider will handle the payment suspension automatically.

It’s crucial that you confirm your status before holding off on payments. In the case that your loan does not qualify, avoiding payments could negatively affect your credit or result in penalties and extra fees.

To see if your loan qualifies for CARES Act relief, contact your provider.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Options for Borrowers Not Covered Under the CARES Act</h4>
Even if you do not have a loan from the Department of Education, you still may be eligible for relief due to COVID-19. Student loan providers know that since so many have lost their jobs and income, making payments could be close to impossible at the moment.

By contacting your provider, you can see the options that are available, such as postponed payments or lower payments that can offer some wiggle room until you get back on your feet.","The coronavirus outbreak has caused changes to certain student loans to provide some much-needed relief to borrowers via the CARES Act.

259,"See If You’re Eligible For Free Food From The WIC Program","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

We’ll look at what it takes to be eligible for such food assistance and reveal a handy tool you can use to see if you qualify.

The concept of food stamps is nothing new, as they’ve helped many families stay fed over the years when they found it tough to stay financially afloat.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

While the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is not food stamps in the traditional sense, it can help certain people nutritionally. And even if you’ve never used it or are unfamiliar with WIC, the coronavirus outbreak could make it a necessity as you look for ways to fill your family’s nutritional needs.

Who can use WIC, and what does it take to receive benefits? Let’s take a look at that now.
<h4>How WIC Determines Eligibility</h4>
While food stamps are more mainstream, widespread, and well-known, WIC is more specialized, and this is reflected in the program’s name.

Women, infants, and children are groups of people for whom the program was created, and here is the breakdown of how each group can qualify:

Women (must meet one of the following):
<ul>
 	<li>Pregnant</li>
 	<li>Postpartum</li>
 	<li>Breastfeeding</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

If pregnant, the beneficiary can receive WIC during her pregnancy and six weeks after it’s finished or she gives birth. If in postpartum, benefits will be available up to six months after birth or the pregnancy’s end. If breastfeeding, benefits can be received until the infant reaches the age of one.

Infant eligibility lasts until they are one. WIC eligibility for children, meanwhile, continues until the age of five.

Beyond that first set of requirements of fitting into the women, infants, or children category, the applicant must also live in the state where they are applying. This meets WIC’s residential requirement.

For the income requirement, the applicant can get automatic eligibility if they are already receiving or are eligible for other assistance programs from either the federal government or the state.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

For instance, if you or a household member receive or are eligible for SNAP, TANF, or Medicaid, you could automatically fulfill WIC’s income requirement. If not, you could meet it by falling within your state’s income standard, which can be found here.

Lastly, the WIC applicant must meet the nutrition risk requirement, which states that they have a medical-based issue, such as underweight or anemia, or a dietary-based problem, such as a poor diet.

If all four requirements of category, residential, income, and nutrition risk are met, the applicant may be eligible for WIC.
<h4>How to See If You’re Eligible for WIC Benefits</h4>
All it takes is about 15 minutes to see if you could be eligible for WIC food assistance. Simply click here, and you can use the WIC Prescreening Tool online.

It’s worth noting that the tool only offers a glimpse into your potential eligibility for these benefits. It’s not the actual application you’ll need to complete to get WIC assistance, as you’ll need to make an appointment with your local agency to do so.

To find the agency nearest you, go here. Select your state and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to be pointed in the right direction.","Food assistance from WIC can undoubtedly come in handy after the economic destruction from COVID-19.

263,"Before You Sign A Rent-To-Own Agreement, Read This","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If so, you’ll want to read this before you make anything official.

Do you feel as if your status as a “renter” will never change? In other words, have you possibly put your dreams of owning a home on hold forever?

If so, you’ll be glad to know that there’s a way to be a renter while also moving closer to your home owning dreams. It’s called a rent-to-own agreement, and it’s the perfect solution for some who can’t get or afford a mortgage for the time being, but would still like to set their sights on owning a home.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>How Rent-To-Own Homes Work</h4>
You’re probably familiar with how a typical rental agreement works. You pay your landlord a certain amount every month (rent), and in exchange, they allow you to live in a property they own.

With rent-to-own, you still pay rent. However, some of your payment goes towards the purchase of that property at a future date when the lease ends.

Leases in such agreements typically last between one to five years. Once finished, you will have a credit with the landlord that can reduce the purchase price of the property you wish to make yours.
<h4>Things to Be Aware of Before Signing a Rent-To-Own Contract</h4>
As with any contract, you’ll want to do plenty of research before locking yourself into a rent-to-own agreement. These agreements are usually best when they are part of a government-run program, or they’re of the “lease-option” variety.

Both reduce your risk, and lease-option is favorable because while it lets you purchase the home before your lease ends, it doesn’t bind you like a “lease-purchase” agreement does.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Here are some other things to look out for before locking yourself into a rent-to-own contract:
<h4>Monthly Payments</h4>
Part of your monthly payment will be rent to the landlord. The rest will be an amount that goes towards the home’s future purchase. As such, you can expect to pay more out of pocket each month for living expenses.

Keep in mind that not all of what you pay extra will go towards the home’s purchase. Some of it will go into the landlord’s pocket as a fee for setting up this agreement.
<h4>Upfront Fees</h4>
Unlike a security deposit on a rental, a rent-to-own agreement usually has a nonrefundable, upfront fee that can equal 2.5-7 percent of the home’s purchase price. If your cash is low, this fee could be a tough obstacle to overcome.
<h4>Price Fluctuations</h4>
When you sign the rent-to-own contract, it will be for the home’s current value. If it decreases when the lease ends, you will still have to pay for the purchase price in the contract.

This can lead to a situation where the home decreases in value, and you end up overpaying for it in the future. Getting a mortgage for an amount that exceeds the home’s value could be troublesome down the road.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Repair and Maintenance Costs</h4>
Landlords usually pass these on to the eventual buyer in rent-to-own agreements. If you know anything about home repair and maintenance, you know it can be quite costly.
<h4>Punctual Payments</h4>
You can’t afford to miss payments when a rent-to-own contract is in place. Doing so could void the deal, causing you to lose whatever credited money you had towards the purchase of the house.","Are you interested in using a rent-to-own agreement to purchase a home eventually?","2021-01-11 10:50:43",post,https://section8assist.com/before-you-sign-a-rent-to-own-agreement-read-this/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_524599192.jpg,shutterstock_524599192.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_524599192.jpg,265,shutterstock_524599192,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_524599192.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,before-you-sign-a-rent-to-own-agreement-read-this,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-19 20:30:07"
269,"4 Reasons To Get Your Degree Now Via Distance Learning","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

With distance learning, it’s not only a possible move, but a smart one too. Have you recently realized that it’s time to take a new path in life? Maybe you aren’t satisfied with your job and its pay.

Perhaps you were laid off due to being deemed as “nonessential,” which made you question job security. Or maybe you simply weren’t doing what you loved, which made you start to think about advancing your education to change your reality.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Regardless of why you’d want to start studying, doing it at a distance certainly has its benefits. And while distance learning was once seen as a unique setup, it’s now becoming the norm as students shift studying from on campus and into their homes.

If you need a little nudge to take the leap to get your degree online, have a look at these benefits that distance learning can bring.
<h4>1. It’s more affordable than you think.</h4>
It’s no secret that a college education can be quite costly, and all of the talks about the student loan crisis reflects this. However, there are ways to distance learn at a discount, and those ways are called scholarships.

There are plenty of distance learning scholarships out there that can help you achieve your dream of getting your degree online. You may want to search as soon as you finish reading this just to see what’s available. You’d be surprised at how much money some of the awards are worth.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

The more online scholarships you get, the more affordable your education becomes. Combine that with the rest of the benefits in this list, and it becomes rather apparent that distance learning is now the way to go.

Beyond scholarships, think of all the costs you can cut when studying at home. You won’t have to waste gas going to class. You won’t have to pay for on-campus housing. And since you’re at home, you’ll be able to eat more affordably in your kitchen instead of eating out in between classes.
<h4>2. You create your own schedule.</h4>
There’s no need to show up to virtual class on time (in most cases), unlike those meetings held on campus. This makes distance learning extremely convenient, as it allows you to craft a schedule that fits your needs.

Beyond the convenience of creating your schedule, you also have to factor in performance. By studying when you want, you can pick your peak times for absorbing information instead of adhering to a strict schedule.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. You can stay at home.</h4>
Nothing beats the comfort of your couch, and it’s an ideal place to get studying done. While this comfort benefit of distance learning is quite nice, what if you have kids?

By being able to stay home, you can cut childcare costs, which have recently spiraled out of control. This allows you to keep more money in your pocket for other expenses.
<h4>4. You can work.</h4>
If you currently have a full-time job, you may not want to give up that income just to study. With distance learning, you can still work a full-time job and study in your off hours. Such flexibility would be quite tricky as a regular on-campus student.","Now’s a great time to take advantage of your time at home and start working towards your degree.","2020-08-10 09:52:47",post,https://section8assist.com/4-reasons-to-get-your-degree-now-via-distance-learning/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1032878401.jpg,shutterstock_1032878401.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1032878401.jpg,271,shutterstock_1032878401,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1032878401.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,4-reasons-to-get-your-degree-now-via-distance-learning,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:50:58"
274,"Frequently Asked Questions For Low-Income Homebuyers","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

To help you get started on your quest to become a homeowner despite income, credit, or savings issues, have a look at these frequently asked questions and answers.
<h4>1. Can I buy a home with help from the government?</h4>
You may know that the government can help you with rent assistance via Section 8 and other programs. But it can also help you with buying a home.

There are several ways to buy an affordable home with help from the government. If you feel like a lack of savings is holding you back, you can apply for down payment assistance (DPA). This results in an average of $12,000 towards the purchase of homes.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Get down payment assistance via a grant, and you won’t have to pay it back. Get it through a loan, and you’ll be able to make payments with low interest.

Besides down payment assistance, you can also get home buying help from the government through USDA or FHA loans. The government backs these mortgages, which allows for applicants to qualify for them despite lower credit scores, low income, and a lack of down payment.
<h4>2. What are some examples of home buying programs for people with low income?</h4>
Should you not qualify for a traditional mortgage, don’t fret. Here is just a handful of low-income home buying programs that can save the day:
<ul>
 	<li>USDA loans – To help you buy an affordable house outside of the city.</li>
 	<li>FHA loans – Low down payments and accepting of low income and low credit scores.</li>
 	<li>HomeReady loans – Let you buy a home with low income and a small three percent down payment from Fannie Mae.</li>
 	<li>Home Possible loans – Another option for low-income purchasers with small down payments from Freddie Mac.</li>
 	<li>VA loans – If you’re a member of the armed services or a veteran, you can get loans here with zero money down.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. What does it take to qualify for a low-income home loan?</h4>
Each mortgage program has its requirements. If you feel as if you won’t get approved for a loan, you could take on a co-borrower to boost your qualifying income. Otherwise, here are some examples of what to expect from different programs:
<ul>
 	<li>USDA – Make between 50-80 percent of the Area Median Income.</li>
 	<li>FHA – 580 credit score, 45 percent debt-to-income ratio. Put 10 percent down, and you could qualify with a credit score as low as 500.</li>
 	<li>VA – Be a veteran or service member.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. What’s a good loan program for a first-time, low-income homebuyer?</h4>
You can get a big jump on the process by getting down payment assistance. You can also try some of the aforementioned low-income loan programs like USDA, FHA, VA, HomeReady, or Home Possible.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Do you need proof of income to buy a home?</h4>
The carefree days of buying a home without proof of income are now over. If you don’t want to submit a W2 or use traditional proofs of income, however, you can use bank statements, retirement accounts, or assets to achieve that goal.

If proof of income is a significant issue, you may want to look into a bank statement loan.","Low income doesn’t translate into never owning a home.

279,"No Down Payment? This Assistance Makes Buying A Home No Problem","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

With down payment assistance (DPA), becoming a homeowner just got a lot easier. Several things can stand in your way of owning a home. A low credit score is one of them, as is low income. What about down payments, though?

Since they require you to have a certain percentage of your home paid for upfront, down payments could be seen as the biggest obstacle around, especially if you live paycheck to paycheck. After all, how can you save for a home when almost all of your money is going towards your rent?

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Luckily, down payment assistance makes this major roadblock disappear. And if you’re one of the many people that never knew such aid existed, now’s the time to see how it can work for you.
<h4>Different Types of Down Payment Assistance</h4>
As you begin your search for help with funding your home purchase, you’ll likely come across these four categories of down payment assistance:
<ol>
 	<li>Grant – This gains the top spot on the list since it’s the most common form of DPA. More importantly, you could say it’s the best form since it acts as a gift, and you don’t have to pay it back.</li>
 	<li>A loan that you must pay down alongside your primary mortgage.</li>
 	<li>A loan with deferred payments that won’t have to be made until you want to move, refinance, or sell the home.</li>
 	<li>A loan that is forgiven for a certain number of years (usually 5-20). You’ll only have to pay it if you decide to move, refinance, or sell the home.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

It’s worth noting that numbers 2-4 in that list all act as second mortgages. As far as interest rates go, those DPA loans may have no interest at all, or have rates that are lower, equal, or higher than your primary mortgage.
<h4>What It Takes to Get Down Payment Assistance</h4>
Unfortunately, DPA isn’t just given out to anyone who applies. Regardless of the type of DPA you seek, there will be requirements that come with it.

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, you may have a higher chance of getting such assistance, since these programs were put into place with such applicants in mind. Even if you’ve bought a home before, you could still classify as a “first-time homebuyer” if you haven’t been a homeowner within the previous three years.

Although each DPA has its own requirements, here are some of the most common ones that you may run into while doing your search:
<ul>
 	<li>You must use the home as your primary residence.</li>
 	<li>You must have either low or moderate income.</li>
 	<li>The home must sit in a targeted census tract or qualified area.</li>
 	<li>An approved lender/loan program must be used.</li>
</ul>

Here are some entities which offer DPA:
<ul>
 	<li>Cities</li>
 	<li>Counties</li>
 	<li>States</li>
 	<li>The federal government</li>
 	<li>Charities</li>
</ul>
How can you quickly pinpoint the funding you need? Your best bet is to do an online search for “down payment assistance grants” in your area.","Putting together a down payment to purchase your dream home no longer has to be an obstacle.","2021-08-01 07:30:02",post,https://section8assist.com/no-down-payment-this-assistance-makes-buying-a-home-no-problem/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_343468016-1.jpg,shutterstock_343468016-1.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_343468016-1.jpg,281,shutterstock_343468016-1,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_343468016-1.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,no-down-payment-this-assistance-makes-buying-a-home-no-problem,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-09 13:58:49"

At the very top of the list is immediate food aid. It makes sense to list this first because if you need food right now, some other programs may not fit the bill.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->
<h4>How to Get Help Now</h4>
To get immediate food aid, call the USDA National Hunger Hotline. Its number is 1-866-3-HUNGRY. You can receive help in either English or Spanish during the hours of 7 am to 10 pm Monday through Friday.

Beyond calling that hotline, USA.gov suggests contacting local religious or community organizations for immediate food assistance. You can find such organizations in your area by dialing 211 on your phone.
<h4>Changes to Food Programs Due to the Coronavirus</h4>
You can get more long-term food help through USA.gov through two popular programs: Food stamps (SNAP) and WIC.

Due to health concerns from COVID-19 and the increased need for food, the government has made it easier to get benefits from these programs.

For instance, <a href=""http://hardshiprecovery.com/applying-for-snap-benefits-are-you-eligible/"">food stamp benefits may be higher</a>. You may be able to enroll in food assistance programs online instead of in person. And if you have any kids that need meals, you can get them from school without having to bring them along for proof.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Speaking of school meals, the USA.gov food assistance page can teach you about how to get free food for school-age children. It can also provide similar help if you have any seniors in the household who require nutritious food.

Lastly, if you’re ever a victim of a disaster, there’s helpful information on the page regarding D-SNAP benefits.","If you’re wondering where to get food assistance when money’s tight due to COVID-19, one website may cure all of your nutritional needs.","2020-08-10 09:57:32",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-use-the-usa-gov-website-for-covid-19-food-assistance/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1716947941.jpg,shutterstock_1716947941.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1716947941.jpg,286,shutterstock_1716947941,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1716947941.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-use-the-usa-gov-website-for-covid-19-food-assistance,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:51:07"
289,"How To Find Utility Assistance In Your State","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

How do most people suggest you cut utility costs to make more room in your budget? By cutting back on usage. In other words, they suggest you do things that can make home life a lot less comfortable, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Not using your AC or heater so much.</li>
 	<li>Taking fewer showers.</li>
 	<li>Flushing the toilet less often.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

Are making such moves the only way to make your utilities more affordable? No, as you can get help from the government and charities to pay at least a portion of your bills.

Will you have to make below a certain income to be eligible for most utility assistance programs? Probably, but even if you don’t think you make the cut, do the following to see where you stand.

Who knows? You may qualify for a government assistance program that can give you money towards your bills, so you have some much-needed breathing room.
<h4>How to Get Help Paying Your Utility Bills</h4>
There are several ways to find government assistance programs that focus on utilities, but visiting this link may be the best of the bunch.

Once there, you’ll see a drop-down list of states, plus a list of direct links to state energy assistance applications.

Use the drop-down menu to pick your state. On your state’s page, depending on where you live, you may see different options for low-income energy programs that are separated as:
<ul>
 	<li>Federal</li>
 	<li>State</li>
 	<li>Utility</li>
 	<li>Charitable</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

The primary federal program is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). It offers help with paying your heating and cooling costs in two main ways:

Paying the heating/cooling cost portion of your monthly energy bill.
Improving your home to make it more energy-efficient through “weatherization.”

This program can offer significant benefits now and later on. Should you qualify, you could get monthly help with your energy bill, plus home improvements to seal/insulate your house, or replace your AC or furnace.

You should see links on your state’s page to find local LIHEAP contacts so you can begin the application process.

Beyond LIHEAP, your state may have a utility assistance program of its own. Look below that, and you should see plenty of utility programs from local governments and charities, along with their contact information.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

As an example, here’s a tiny sampling what you can find if you live in Florida and need help with paying your utility bills:
<ul>
 	<li>Good Neighbor Program (Tallahassee) – Free ceiling insulation, hot water leak repair, and heating and cooling system repair.</li>
 	<li>SHARE (Tampa) – Pays for basic home energy expenses.</li>
 	<li>Care to Share Program (Florida Power &amp; Light Company) – Offers up to $500 of electric service per year.</li>
 	<li>Project Care (Lakeland Electric) – Helps the disabled and those 60 or over with paying their electric bills.</li>
</ul>
Have a look at your state’s page to see what they have to offer. If you need more help, you can also call the National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) hotline. Their number is 1-866-674-6327.","Those utility bills don’t seem to be getting any cheaper, do they?

294,"Use These Section 8 Preferences To Get Your Housing Voucher Quicker","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

There’s little doubt that Section 8 rental assistance can be a huge help if you’re struggling to pay the bills. If approved for a housing voucher, part of your rent can be paid by a Public Housing Agency (PHA) directly to the landlord. Pay the remaining rent out of your pocket, and you’re good to go.

While this is probably great news if you’re behind on your rent payment, there is one downside to Section 8 vouchers: The time it takes to get them.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Why Are Section 8 Waiting Lists so Long?</h4>
Depending on your PHA, which can be found here, you may have to wait several years to get your housing voucher. Why is the wait so long? Blame it on demand.

Simply put, the people that need voucher assistance far exceed its supply. And in areas where the demand is especially high, the wait can be much longer.

Even if you fulfill all of the eligibility requirements for Section 8, there are cases where your application can be rejected due to demand. That’s why it's important to not only start the application process now, but to also include all the relevant details when applying.

What’s one of the most important details you can include? Those that deal with preferences, especially when you gain a spot on the Section 8 waiting list.

What is a “preference”? It’s a circumstance or characteristic that the PHA gives priority over others. And if one or more applies to your situation, it can get you a housing voucher quicker.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How Waiting List Preferences Work</h4>
For a preference to be applicable, it must relate to one of the following family members:
<ul>
 	<li>Head of household</li>
 	<li>Co-head</li>
 	<li>Spouse</li>
</ul>
To prove that the preference is true, documentation will be needed. Once verified, the preference is usually assigned a point value by the PHA. The more preferences you have, the more points you can accumulate, which can push you closer to the front of the voucher line.

As with procedures, waiting list times, and other Section 8 factors, the use of waiting list preferences depends on your PHA. Preferences used in one location may not apply to another, and some PHAs may not use any at all.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

To find out which preferences your PHA uses, contact them, and ask. If any apply to you, be sure to mention them during the application process so you can get your voucher as soon as possible.

Here are some examples of waiting list preferences:
<ul>
 	<li>Rent-burdened – Paying a disproportionate percentage of your income towards rent.</li>
 	<li>Homeless – Living on the streets or in a shelter.</li>
 	<li>Residing in substandard housing – One with no plumbing, electricity, kitchen, etc.</li>
 	<li>Domestic violence victims – Legal documentation may be necessary.</li>
 	<li>Displaced by a natural disaster – Forced out of your home due to a flood, fire, etc.</li>
 	<li>Displaced by government action – Removed from your home due to code enforcement, cuts to housing funding, etc.</li>
 	<li>Disabled – Cannot live or function on your own, in need of more accessible housing, etc.</li>
</ul>
Many more preferences exist, so don’t forget to ask your PHA which ones are being given priority in your area.","It could be years before you get your Section 8 housing voucher. Use these waiting list preferences to accelerate the process.","2020-08-10 05:59:29",post,https://section8assist.com/use-these-section-8-preferences-to-get-your-housing-voucher-quicker/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1564624228.jpg,shutterstock_1564624228.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1564624228.jpg,296,shutterstock_1564624228,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1564624228.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,use-these-section-8-preferences-to-get-your-housing-voucher-quicker,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 18:59:30"
523,"A Comprehensive To-Do List For Adult Students","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Before we get into a long list of things an adult student should do before making their next move to improve their life, let’s loosely define who such a person is. An adult student could be considered any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Someone who never went to college, yet wants to do so now.</li>
 	<li>A person who started college, but never finished.</li>
 	<li>A worker who wants to expand their skills or knowledge to advance in their field.</li>
 	<li>Someone looking to start all over and find a new career.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

If any of those situations seem familiar, here are several things worth looking into that can provide clarity and guide you closer to your goal:
<h4>Get Your GED</h4>
If you don’t have your high school diploma, get your GED certificate from your state, as you may need it if you want to go to school or jump into a new career.
<h4>Research Jobs</h4>
If you’re looking for a new career, <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this tool</a> from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics can help you pick one with a bright future. You can browse occupations by group, such as healthcare, to see jobs in each sector, a summary of what’s expected, required education, and median pay. You can also discover what the highest-paying jobs are right now and where growth is likely to occur so you can pick an occupation that’s in-demand.

The Federal Student Aid website has a similar tool that can help you search for careers to discover the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Job descriptions</li>
 	<li>Required education</li>
 	<li>Required skills, abilities, and knowledge</li>
 	<li>Average annual salary</li>
 	<li>Projected demand</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Research Schools</h4>
The College Navigator tool from the National Center for Education Statistics can help find the right college for you. You can look for schools in your area, browse different programs, and more to see where you may want to attend.

The U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard is another tool worth using. It can also help you find the right fit by giving you insight into a school’s costs, admissions, programs, and more. It’s quite handy when you need to compare different schools so you can make your final choice.
<h4>Get Help From Your Employer</h4>
If you want to advance in your current career, your employer may be able to help you finance your education. Ask if they have tuition assistance, as it could make going to college much more affordable.

Besides employer help, you may be able to cut your college costs due to your work as an employee. You can learn more about this by reading the IRS’ Publication 970 on Tax Benefits for Education. It details information on tax credits for students, plus how tuition fees and deductions work.
<h4>Look for Scholarships</h4>
Besides a current employer, scholarships are another great way to cut college costs. You can search among thousands of scholarships using the CareerOneStop site from the U.S. Department of Labor.

If you’re not familiar with the different types of student aid besides just scholarships, go <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> to learn more.
<h4>Fill Out Your FAFSA</h4>
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is a form that can show schools your level of financial need. With this information, they can offer you scholarships, and you can see if you qualify for any federal grants that you won’t have to pay back.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Get To Know the Financial Aid Office</h4>
Once you settle on a school, contact its financial aid office to see what forms of assistance are available.
<h4>Pay Attention to Deadlines</h4>
Whether you’re going to community college, a four-year university, a career school, or applying for financial aid, keep an eye on those deadlines.

Many years have passed, and for one reason or another, you decide you’re not exactly happy where you are. Maybe that dream of going to college and setting foot on campus can’t get out of your head.

Perhaps it bothers you that you started college years ago and never finished your degree. Or maybe you’re simply sick of your boss, sick of your path, and want more pay and a new and exciting career.

Regardless of which situation sounds like yours, there’s one thing that can put you closer to making your dreams come true: Information. Why? Because information provides clarity, which can help you see the light and understand what steps to take to reach your goals.

Thanks to the Internet, information is more readily available than ever. And when it comes to colleges or careers, here are some of the best tools you’ll find.
<h4>Online Tools for Researching Careers</h4>
Before you can pick a college or career school, you have to figure out what you want to do. Unless that’s perfectly clear, you’ll probably need a little help to see what fits you best.

A great place to begin is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook. It has everything you need to know about jobs in different career fields, and you could spend weeks or longer using all of its features.

Here are just some things you can use the site for:
<ul>
 	<li>Find the highest-paying occupations.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>Demand for different careers</li>
 	<li>Daily tasks involved</li>
 	<li>Average annual salary</li>
 	<li>Education and training requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Online Tools for Researching Schools</h4>
After you use the two tools above to figure out your career path, the next step is to research schools. You can begin doing so with the College Navigator tool. It lets you perform side-by-side comparisons of schools to see which is your best bet.

If you have no schools in mind, you can do an advanced search to find schools according to location, setting, enrollment, tuition rates, and more.

Your school search doesn’t end there, though, as you can also use the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard to find your ideal fit.

Going to a college or four-year university isn’t the only way to get a degree and advance your career, as you can do so with technical college too.

For some reason, though, people tend to think that tech schools involve tons of out-of-pocket costs, and since they’re not traditional, college is a better route to take. Luckily, that’s not true, as you can get free money for tech school via the various avenues in this article.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Can You Learn at a Technical School?</h4>
Tech or trade schools offer several options when it comes to fields of study. For instance, you can study to become the following with your technical degree or certificate:
<ul>
 	<li>Chef</li>
 	<li>Computer technician</li>
 	<li>Cosmetologist</li>

 	<li>Plumber</li>
 	<li>Welder</li>
 	<li>And more</li>

What’s the main difference between a trade school and college? The fact that training is more direct and specialized, and it focuses more on your career instead of general studies.

<h4>Financial Aid for Tech School</h4>
If you’re worried about the costs associated with getting a tech school degree or certification, there’s good news: Just like college, you can get free money for your education.

You may have to dig a little to see if the program you’re interested in has financial aid options. Generally, as long as the program is accredited, you should receive similar aid as if you were attending a four-year college. Here are some of the types of assistance that could be available.
<h4>Tech School Grants and Scholarships</h4>
Both grants and scholarships are similar in that they’re basically free money for school. As long as you follow some guidelines, they don’t have to be paid back like a student loan. Where these forms of free money tend to differ is how they are awarded.

Grants are often need-based. This means that they are given to those who show a financial need, or who are first-generation students, minorities, etc. On the other hand, scholarships are generally merit-based and given according to grades, extracurricular activities, etc.

Where do grants and scholarships come from? The first source is the federal government, which offers the famous <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pell Grant</a>, <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/fseog"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</a>, etc.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

The second source is <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">your state</a>. The third source comes from the school you’re looking to attend. You can find these grants and scholarships by visiting the school’s website or contacting their financial aid office.

Finally, you can get grants and scholarships for technical school from unions and trade organizations. For example, if you want to work in plumbing, heating, or cooling, the <a href=""https://www.phccfoundation.org/foundation/scholarship-program/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PHCC Educational Foundation's awards</a> can make your schooling more affordable.
<h4>Start Searching for Tech School Grants and Scholarships Today</h4>
If you already have a tech school in mind, contact their financial aid office to see the available options. As far as federal grants go, you should <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fill out</a> your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine your financial need. This will open the door for not only federal grant opportunities, but also those from your state and school once it’s complete.","You’re thinking of trying technical school instead of taking the traditional college route, but you’re worried about costs.

You don’t have to go to a college or university to qualify for grants and scholarships, as they exist for tech and trade schools too. What’s the catch? There is none, as the program simply needs to be accredited so you can apply for and hopefully get that free cash.

Whether you’re looking to become a plumber or paralegal, massage therapist or mechanic, or a computer technician or cosmetologist, here are some tips on how to get grants and scholarships towards that goal.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Where To Find Grants and Scholarships for Tech School</h4>
If you’ve looked for grants and scholarships for a traditional college in the past, you’ll be glad to know that the process is similar for tech school.

As far as grants go, the best place to start looking is with the federal government. To do so, you’ll need to complete your <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>. Since grants tend to be need-based, this form determines whether you’re eligible for free money from the federal government. It analyzes your financial need, and if you make the cut, you could get a Pell Grant, which offers over $6,000 per year towards schooling and other federal grants.

If you’re serious about going to trade school soon, you’ll want to complete your FAFSA now. Not only does it determine eligibility for federal grants, but it also shows your financial need to states, which are the next source of free money. You can find education grants from your state by going <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

After you see how much free money the federal government and your state have to give, your next stop is the school you’re planning to attend. Contact their financial aid office to see what they have available in the form of grants and scholarships. For instance, if you’re looking to work in the beauty industry and attend <a href=""https://paulmitchell.edu/nationalscholarship"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Paul Mitchell Schools</a>, you could get a scholarship to pursue your dream.

The search for free money doesn’t stop there, though, as tech schools have yet another source of grants and scholarships: Unions and trade organizations. You can find these by searching online for organizations linked to your field. Visit their websites, and you may see sections dedicated to grants and scholarships for prospective students looking to become part of the industry. As an example, students looking to work with automotive technology can <a href=""https://techforce.org/scholarships/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">get scholarships from the TechForce Foundation</a>.

One more place to look for funding toward your trade school degree or certificate is your current employer. If you’re looking to remain in that field and advance your career, they may be willing to help you with tuition assistance.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

What do many recent high school graduates and adults looking for a change have in common? A desire to get their college degree.

Regardless of your age, a degree is possible. And if you think money is the main obstacle standing in your way, here are several options you can use to fund your educational adventure.

[the_ad id=""342""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Federal Student Loans</h4>
Are there ways to get free money for college? You bet, and we’ll discuss them in a bit. But if you don’t qualify for any free money, it’s good to know that you can fall back on <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">federal student loans</a>.

Here are some of the benefits of getting a student loan from the government:
<ul>
 	<li>Usually easy to qualify for.</li>
 	<li>Poor credit history is often ignored.</li>
 	<li>No co-signer is needed.</li>
 	<li>Interest rates are fixed and low.</li>
 	<li>As long as you’re actively enrolled half-time in school, no payments are due.</li>
 	<li>Repayment can be postponed or converted into flexible plans, if necessary.</li>
 	<li>Can offer student loan forgiveness in some instances due to employment.</li>
 	<li>Can reduce interest rates to make repayment more manageable.</li>
</ul>
While those benefits may sound good, you still may want to avoid going into debt at all. The following options can help you achieve that goal.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Federal Work-Study Program</h4>
As its name suggests, <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a Federal Work-Study program</a> gives you the best of both worlds during college. You get to work near or on campus, often in a job related to your field. This not only gives you valuable experience before you graduate, but it also provides financial aid for your studies.

Qualifying for this particular program often involves showing a financial need, which is determined when you complete your <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>.
<h4>3. Federal Grants</h4>
The FAFSA form mentioned above is a must if you want to qualify for <a href=""https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">federal grants</a>. Like scholarships, grants are financial awards that do not have to be paid back, making them desirable options for funding your studies.

With your FAFSA complete, the federal government can see if you have sufficient financial need to qualify for a grant. And while getting a Pell Grant, for example, from the government can give you a nice boost, your FAFSA also paves the way for even more funding options.
<h4>4. Grants and Scholarships</h4>
Let’s say you show sufficient financial need via your FAFSA. The federal government sees it, but so can your state and the school you’re about to attend. What does this mean? That you’ll get even more grant opportunities from your state and school.

Beyond that, you can also search for scholarships from individuals, employers, nonprofits, private companies, social organizations, professional organizations, and more. Your school’s financial aid office should have plenty of scholarship resources, and you can <a href=""https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">use this website</a> to start searching on your own.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Your Employer</h4>
Here’s a resource that you may have overlooked when it comes to cash for college. Your employer may have a tuition assistance program that can help finance your studies, especially if you’re looking to stick with the company.
<h4>6. Emergency Financial Aid</h4>
Applying for and receiving traditional grants and scholarships usually takes some planning. If you need quick cash for classes, and don’t want to take out costly personal loans, talk to your school’s financial aid office. They can connect you to emergency financial aid options from the government, school, and other organizations that can help when time is of the essence.","Don’t let your degree-linked dreams diminish due to a lack of money.

The last thing a mother needs is to wonder how she’ll feed her children. Unfortunately, this is a concern for many mothers across the country, which is why it’s good to know that the USDA has programs that can lend a helping hand. Here are four in particular that are incredibly helpful for babies, young children, and women:
<h4>1. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</h4>
When it comes to food assistance programs for babies, young children, and women, WIC may be the most popular of its kind.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

To qualify for WIC, you must fit into one of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Pregnant woman</li>
 	<li>Breastfeeding woman</li>
 	<li>Non-breastfeeding postpartum woman</li>
 	<li>Infant</li>
 	<li>Toddler or child up to five years old</li>

<h4>2. WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP)</h4>
As you can tell by its name, this program is linked to WIC. It offers coupons that can be used at farmers’ markets and roadside stands to supplement your diet with healthy fruits and vegetables.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h4>
This program wasn’t put in place specifically to serve babies, young children, and women, but many still use it for their nutritional needs.

SNAP is the current name for what used to be called food stamps, and it was created to help families stay fed while they move towards independence.

To be eligible for SNAP benefits, you’ll need to meet specific income requirements, resource limits, and more. Once qualified, you’ll likely receive an EBT card that works like a debit card. Take it to a participating store, and you can swipe it to pay for certain foods, such as:

 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Fish</li>
 	<li>Dairy</li>

 	<li>Adult daycare center</li>
 	<li>After-school care program</li>

Staying safe is probably a priority during this coronavirus pandemic, but so is staying fed. After all, you can’t survive if you can’t eat, but the numerous shutdowns have made buying food frustrating for many families. You can blame this on businesses closing, jobs being lost, and income dropping drastically.

While the thought of going without food isn’t a pleasant one, know that there are several ways you can get help. Let’s look at some of them now.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Different Forms of Coronavirus Food Assistance</h3>
<h4>Immediate Food Assistance</h4>
What’s your best move if you notice that your kitchen is empty today, and you have a family to feed? For emergency food assistance, you can start by calling the National Hunger Hotline. It’s been live for two years now, and it can come in handy in times like these.

Whether you’re an individual or family in need of food, you can find it by calling 866-3-HUNGRY on Monday through Friday between 7 am and 10 pm. Once you call, you’ll be connected with an operator who can tell you about the different food assistance programs in your area.

Another phone number you can call is 211. Just as you’d call 911 for an emergency, you can do the same with 211 for urgent assistance with food and things like housing, healthcare, and more.

If the thought of calling a hotline isn’t your thing, you can also use the Internet to find emergency food assistance within minutes. Three sites, in particular, are easy to use and loaded with information on local food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and the like:

 	<li><a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Feeding America</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Long-Term Food Assistance</h4>
Those options above can help you if you need food today, but what about the future? What if you want some stability when it comes to purchasing food that can make it easier to sleep at night knowing your family will always be fed? To achieve that goal, you can start with SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Formerly known as food stamps, SNAP currently helps 1 in 7 Americans with buying groceries. While there are some restrictions on what you can buy with your benefits, it’s good to know you can purchase things like meat, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and more. To learn more about SNAP, go here.

WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, is similar to SNAP. It specializes in helping pregnant women or those who have children under five years old.

Qualify for WIC, and you’ll be able to buy necessities like baby formula, milk, and other nutritional foods. To contact your WIC state agency, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/toll-free-numbers-wic-state-agencies"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">go here</a>.

You can live without luxuries like eating out, entertainment, vacations, etc. However, you can’t live without such necessities as housing, food, utilities, and medical care.

The government and many nonprofit organizations know this, which is why they’ve set up emergency assistance programs to help those in need. We’ll look at some of the options you have when times get tough, so you and your family never go without.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Housing Assistance</h4>
For most, rent is easily the biggest bill, which also makes it the hardest to pay. Since you need that roof over your shelter, you can’t neglect the rent for too long, or else you’ll end up on the streets.

You can find emergency rent assistance by calling 211. Once you connect with an operator, tell them your housing situation. They can then give you a list of local programs that offer last-minute help with the rent.

The operator may refer you to the <a href=""https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/""> Salvation Army</a> or <a href=""https://www.catholiccharitiesusa.org/""> Catholic Charities</a> , as both are known to offer emergency rent assistance. You may also be referred to local religious organizations that sometimes provide rental help. <a href=""https://www.voa.org/housing""> Give Volunteers of America a look as well</a>.

Crowdfunding is another option. It’s where you get help from others to pay your rent through companies like <a href=""https://www.modestneeds.org/""> Modest Needs</a> or <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/"">GoFundMe</a>. Since both leverage the Internet's power, you could get the help you need much quicker and easier than you think.

When it comes to the government, rental assistance is more long term. They may not offer rental aid right now, but they can provide stability in the future through <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8""> Section 8 housing vouchers</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Food Assistance</h4>
Besides shelter, food is an absolute necessity. 211 can help here once again, as they can tell you about local food distribution sites or programs.

<a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/need-help-find-food""> Feeding America</a> can help you find both emergency and long-term food assistance through their network. With over 60,000 food pantries and 200 food banks at their disposal, you’re bound to get fed by contacting them. The nonprofit can also help you sign up for food assistance programs from the government, like <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility""> SNAP</a> and <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-eligibility-requirements""> WIC</a>.

SNAP can give you money every month that can be used at participating stores to buy nutritional necessities. WIC can do the same, but it focuses more on pregnant women and their young children.
<h4>Utilities Assistance</h4>
Once you have the roof over your head and your family’s fed, you have to keep the lights on. The government’s <a href=""https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap/about""> Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</a> can do just that. They can even offer funding to repair or replace your air conditioning and heating systems.

Beyond the government, you can also get emergency utilities assistance by calling 211 or going through <a href=""https://www.modestneeds.org/""> Modest Needs</a>.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Medical Assistance</h4>
You can’t forget about your health, although rising medical costs may force you to.  <a href=""https://www.211.org/services/essential-needs""> 211 can provide emergency medical assistance</a> through its essential needs services, or you can turn to <a href=""https://www.nafcclinics.org/""> the National Association of Free &amp; Charitable Clinics</a>.

The federal government can help as well with its <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/get-help-paying-costs/medicare-savings-programs""> Medicare Savings Programs</a>.","What can you do when you’re out of money and bills need to be paid?

What can you do if you are pregnant, just had a baby, or have infant children depending on you to put food on the table? Once your fridge empties, you can start by calling on friends and family for help.

You could also get a personal loan or put groceries on the credit card, but both of those moves will put you in debt. You could also seek food assistance from the USDA, which has four programs that help feed women, babies, and young children for free.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

As with most government programs, the following have specific requirements you must meet to qualify for their benefits. Visit the links in each section to learn more about the programs and how you can apply via their official government websites.
<h4>SNAP aka Food Stamps</h4>
You probably heard of food stamps as a kid, and while that’s no longer their official name, this government benefit still exists as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP.

SNAP helps low-income families put food on the table to provide assistance while getting their finances in order. And even though it wasn’t made specifically with women, babies, and children in mind, it can certainly help anyone in those categories get the nutrition they need.

Now that food stamps are out the window, SNAP benefits come in a different form: An EBT card. It looks like a debit card and functions like one at participating grocery stores.

You just pick out the SNAP-eligible foods, go to the cashier, swipe your SNAP benefits card, and get those necessities at no cost.

What can you buy with SNAP? Luxuries like alcohol, cigarettes, and hot foods are a no-no. You can, however, get essentials like meat, milk, fruits, vegetables, etc.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>WIC</h4>

While SNAP was made more with general low-income families in mind, WIC was developed for who’s listed in its official name: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.

WIC offers necessities in the form of baby formula, cereal, eggs, milk, baby foods, etc. to the following living in low-income households:
<ul>
 	<li>Pregnant or breastfeeding women</li>
 	<li>Non-breastfeeding postpartum women</li>
 	<li>Infants</li>
 	<li>Children up to five years of age</li>
</ul>
Making below a certain income isn’t the only requirement, however, as you’ll also need to be dubbed a nutritional risk to participate in WIC.

While it may be listed separately, the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) falls under the WIC umbrella.

If you qualify for WIC and are a woman, have an infant over fourth months old, or a child age one to five, you can use FMNP benefits to get produce at roadside stands and farmers’ markets.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>CACFP</h4>
The Child and Adult Care Food Program is the fourth and final form of nutritional assistance in this list. Through it, the USDA reimburses children or adults in daycare centers, emergency shelters, or after-school care programs with nutritious meals and snacks.","If you don’t know where your next meal will come from, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) can keep you and your children fed via these food assistance programs.

574,"Don’t Fall Victim To These Medicare Open Enrollment Scams","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

What makes the perfect scam? Several factors, but two of the biggest ones that can lead to a scam’s success are easy targets and opportune times.

What’s an easy target for many scammers? Seniors. What’s an opportune time? Right now, as Medicare Open Enrollment has kicked into gear.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

To help you end this year scam-free as far as open enrollment is concerned, we’ll discuss some of the most common cons going on at the moment. Keep them in mind for the next few weeks, and you should be good to go while hopefully getting the Medicare coverage you need.

Before we jump into the scams themselves, let’s talk about what Medicare Open Enrollment is, just in case you need a refresher.

This period, which happens annually from October 15 to December 7, allows Medicare enrollees to upgrade their plans. Must you change your plan during open enrollment? No, but you should at least review your current coverage to see that it fits any changes in your health over the past year. And you should also review any changes to your plan for the coming year to ensure you don’t get sticker shock or see surprises when it comes to prescription coverage, in-network providers, and more.

Open enrollment gives you the chance to cut Medicare costs by enrolling in or switching plans, which has many enrollees taking action at this time. If you’re one of them, good for you. But as you take that action, watch out for the following cons.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Open Enrollment Scams To Watch Out For</h3>
<h4>Phone Scams</h4>
It’s always a good idea to avoid phone calls from numbers you don’t recognize to stay completely scam-free. When it comes to open enrollment cons, know that Medicare will not call you. They won’t leave voicemails or send unsolicited text messages either. Instead, they’ll send you mail.

What type of scam calls are making the rounds? Agents asking if you received something in the mail regarding your health insurance. Calls out of the blue where agents try to sell you plans that don’t exist or don’t cover your needs. People telling you they’re calling “from Medicare.”

Some of the most tempting phone scams include claims that you have refunds on the way from last year’s premiums or prescription plans. You can get offers of drug cards that offer deep discounts, but don’t work in the real world. Or you can get calls with promises of cheap health insurance plans and health cards.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>In-Person Scams</h4>
While the phone gives con artists some cover, many will be bold enough to approach you in person. Know that agents cannot come up to you in common areas like hallways, parking lots, sidewalks, or lobbies. They can’t come to your door, nor leave leaflets or flyers on Medicare. And whether it’s on the phone, via the Net, or in person, never offer referrals, share your Medicare number, or let strangers see your Medicare card.

To play it safe, only deal with trusted Medicare sources, such as the program’s <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">official website</a> or <a href=""https://www.shiptacenter.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SHIP</a>, which is your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.","There’s no better time to enhance your Medicare coverage than during the open enrollment period. Con artists know this, though, so beware of these scams.","2020-12-14 21:20:12",post,https://section8assist.com/dont-fall-victim-to-these-medicare-open-enrollment-scams/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1498236200.jpg,shutterstock_1498236200.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1498236200.jpg,575,shutterstock_1498236200,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1498236200.jpg,Resources,"Health Care",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,dont-fall-victim-to-these-medicare-open-enrollment-scams,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:51:21"

It’s a lot easier to spend money than it is to save it, and it’s a lot more fun too. How can you level the playing field, so saving becomes almost as fun as spending? By using challenges that turn it into a game that you and the entire family can enjoy.

Here are some of the most popular money-saving challenges that you can start trying today:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>No Spend Challenge</h4>
The title of this challenge may not sound fun at all. And, depending on your spending habits, it may sound impossible.

What does the No Spend Challenge entail? As its name suggests, you pick a certain amount of time where you vow not to spend any money.

For instance, pick a weekend or even a week where you won’t purchase anything. As long as you pay your bills ahead of time, stock your fridge, and ensure you have gas in the car, it’s doable. Best of all, this challenge will cause you to become creative.

If you don’t want to waste gas beyond going to work or school, you can think of ways to entertain yourself at home. Or, if you need a certain tool to complete a task, you can think of what you already have to get the job done.

If there ever was a perfect time to start the No Spend Challenge, it’s now where you’re more likely to be stuck at home.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Pantry Challenge</h4>
Have you noticed how you go to the store to buy more food without eating what you already have? If you’re like many, this probably happens in your home. And you probably have plenty of items sitting in your fridge or cupboard that haven’t even been opened.

Instead of wasting money on new food, the Pantry Challenge has you eat what you currently have. This not only cleans up your kitchen, but it can also save you a ton of cash.

As long as the food isn’t expired, the Pantry Challenge, like the No Spend Challenge, will cause you to be creative when it’s time to eat. And as you make some meals, you may notice that you’ve been buying things you don’t even eat. This can save you money in the future by being more selective with your purchases.
<h4>Keep All The Change Challenge</h4>
This challenge is rather easy to figure out, as all it has you do is save your change instead of spending it.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Whenever you buy something and get some coins back, put them in a jar or somewhere safe, and don’t touch them for a year. Once the 12 months are over, count up what you have. You’d be surprised at how much you can save by keeping your change untouched, and this can motivate you to start saving dollars regularly.

If you want a more high-tech version of this challenge, download the Acorns app. Instead of keeping spare change, the app rounds up purchase totals and puts it into an investment portfolio. It’s a great way to save and begin investing if you do any shopping online.","Do you find it incredibly difficult to save money?

Do you need experience to complete all of the tasks on that list? Of course not, as many of them are pretty self-explanatory and can be done by almost anyone.

Are those the only tasks that can lead to quick extra cash? Nope, as they’re just a small sample taken from the TaskRabbit site, which is just one place where you can find tasks that people are willing to pay for.

As you read that list, you should be getting plenty of ideas of how you can start making money. If you get enough steady work, it may be enough to quit your full-time job if you want more control over your schedule.

Is completing tasks a profitable venture? It sure can, as you’re just donating your time in most cases, which means there’s no actual monetary investment involved.

Best of all, many of these tasks pay surprisingly well, even if you have no experience. For example, in the Miami area, you could get paid as much as $36 per hour to provide moving help on TaskRabbit.

If you want to do something less physically demanding, how about being a personal assistant? In Miami, that can net you around $20 per hour. Pet sitting, meanwhile, earns an average of $17 per hour to play with other people’s furry friends, and you can make $21 per hour running shopping errands.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

All of this should be great news if you thought you were limited to working a second job or making minimum wage doing something mundane. And while TaskRabbit is quite popular, know that there are many other sites where you can find high-paying tasks to complete, too, with Craigslist being just one example.","You may have the desire to boost your income, but you have no idea how to do it.

592,"7 Things To Avoid When Making Your Holiday Purchases","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Will this crazy year ever end? Many of us hope it’ll leave soon and take COVID-19 and the elections with it.

Luckily, the end of the year is close, and that means one thing: It’s time to start buying those holiday gifts. Of course, this just adds to the chaos, but unless you’re planning to sit this holiday season out, you’ll want to avoid debt with all the future uncertainty looming.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Here are some tips to stay as debt-free as possible while still getting those gifts you need so you can end 2020 on a happy note.
<h4>Mistake 1 – Not budgeting.</h4>
How much can you realistically spend this year? It could be a lot less than previous years, but don’t fret, as you’re certainly not alone.

Make your budget so you have something to follow. Stick to it to keep your finances in order. It’s an absolute must during the holidays.
<h4>Mistake 2 – Not having a list.</h4>
What comes after your budget? Your shopping list, where you pick the people who’ll get gifts and how much they’ll cost.

Don’t let your list dictate your budget. It should be the opposite way around. If everything doesn’t fit, tweak and reduce the list until it does.
<h4>Mistake 3 – Not following your list.</h4>
Want a simple rule to stay within your budget? Don’t buy anything that’s not on your list.

Sure, it doesn’t sound like fun, but you’ll thank yourself later when you don’t have costly credit card bills filling up your mailbox.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Mistake 4 – Waiting until the last minute.</h4>
Some of us get a rush from procrastinating, especially when it comes to shopping. While it may get that adrenaline pumping, you’ll want to avoid last-minute shopping so you can take advantage of early deals, avoid expensive impulse purchases, and reduce stress.
<h4>Mistake 5 – Not tracking your spending.</h4>
When you make your budget, do it in a spreadsheet or an app that allows you to track your spending as you go. Include all holiday expenses, such as food, travel, postage, etc.

By tracking spending, you’ll know how you’re progressing and avoid running out of money before getting everything you need.
<h4>Mistake 6 – Not comparison shopping or using coupons.</h4>
Thanks to the Internet, you no longer have to walk from store to store hunting for the best deals.

You can use apps like Honey, Google Shopping, etc. to see where the lowest price is so you don’t overspend. You can also search for coupons for your desired items to get those savings you deserve.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Mistake 7 – Not being able to say no.</h4>
You won’t be able to please everyone, especially with a coronavirus-impacted budget. Whether it’s your kids, partner, friends, or other family members, make sure they understand that you’re not looking to spend a lot this year.

You’ll also have to learn to say no to yourself. Online deals are expected to be numerous this year as many people stray away from malls due to COVID-19. Unless those deals are for items on your list, just say no.","This year has been stressful enough. Don’t add to that stress by making holiday shopping mistakes that’ll have you drowning in debt in 2021.","2020-12-18 17:35:33",post,https://section8assist.com/?p=592,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1530910454.jpg,shutterstock_1530910454.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1530910454.jpg,593,shutterstock_1530910454,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1530910454.jpg,"Financial Help",,draft,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,7-things-to-avoid-when-making-your-holiday-purchases,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-16 13:37:46"
595,"A Crash Course In Medicare Open Enrollment","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Take this quick crash course, and we’ll bring you up to speed in about five minutes.
<h4>What Is It?</h4>
If you’re enrolled in the program, the Medicare Open Enrollment Period (OEP) gives you the chance to change it. It’s a great time to look at the Medicare coverage you have, see that it fits your needs, or shop around for something more ideal.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>When Is It?</h4>
Open enrollment starts on October 15 and ends on December 7, and it happens every year.
<h4>Who Can Participate?</h4>
Medicare enrollees can participate in open enrollment. While your first chance to enroll in Medicare comes either when you qualify via a disability, or you turn 65, the OEP gives you the power to change that coverage every single year so it can adjust to your needs.
<h4>When Do Open Enrollment Changes Become Effective?</h4>
When you make changes during the OEP to improve your coverage to suit your needs, you can look forward to using your new plan on January 1 of the coming year.
For example, if you use this year’s OEP to change coverage on November 15, 2020, your new plan will kick in on January 1, 2021.
<h4>Is Medicare Open Enrollment the Only Time When You Can Switch Coverage?</h4>
While October 15 to December 7 may be the season for switching most plans, it’s not the only period where changes can be made. There’s a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment, for example, where you can switch from one Advantage plan to another. This period takes place annually between January 1 and March 31. You won’t be able to use it to switch from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare (Parts A and B) or vice versa.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>What Can You Do During Medicare Open Enrollment?</h4>
Here are some of the specific moves you can make during the OEP:

For starters, you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Part D drug plan for the first time. You can drop or switch Part D coverage too. And if you have a Medicare Advantage plan that you no longer want, you can switch to another, or you can enroll in Original Medicare Parts A and B.

As for the benefits of making such moves, Medicare Advantage helps if you want more coverage than Original Medicare can provide. A Part D plan can help with prescription costs if you suddenly need to take multiple drugs. Moving to Original Medicare, meanwhile, can help if you want to cut costs and no longer need the extra coverage an Advantage plan can provide.
<h4>Why Would You Want To Switch Plans?</h4>
Common reasons for switching plans during the OEP include cost-cutting so you can get a lower monthly premium. You may also opt for a plan with more providers in its network, so you have more options.
<h4>Does the OEP Apply To Medigap Plans?</h4>
No. If you want to enroll in a Medigap plan, that enrollment period occurs during the six months after your Medicare eligibility begins. Those six months is the prime time for getting accepted by a Medigap plan and getting good coverage at an affordable price. Opt for Medigap outside of the six-month window, and you could have a harder time getting accepted, or you may end up paying a lot more.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How Do You Change Coverage During Open Enrollment?</h4>
<a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Medicare website</a> lets you shop for new plans so you can find what you need. After you select a plan and join it during open enrollment, you’ll automatically be dropped from your old plan. On January 1, you can begin to enjoy that new coverage.","You may have the urge to participate in Medicare Open Enrollment, but don’t know enough about it to make your move.

598,"3 Simple Ways To Force Yourself To Save Money","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Are you in deep debt because you spend more money than you make? If so, you’re certainly not alone, but that probably doesn’t make you feel much better about the issue.

What could have kept you out of debt? A money-saving mentality that allows you to keep more of what you have instead of constantly making purchases.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Do you have to be born with this mentality? Not at all, as you can develop the financial discipline to start saving your cash, and these three challenges can help you achieve that goal.
<h4>1. Start saving your change.</h4>
Have you heard of the “Keep All The Change Challenge”? If not, you can probably deduce what it involves by looking at its name.

Instead of keeping your change in the car to use at the drive-thru or for other purposes, you store it in a jar or some other safe place. Every time you buy something and get change back, you put it in the jar.

Do this for a year, and you could have quite a nice mound of money that can be used to pay down some of your debt or for other purposes.

If saving change sounds silly, it’s not. You’d be surprised at how spare change can add up over time. Plus, the simple act of not spending that little bit of money can get you in the habit of saving more.

If you make many online purchases, a similar method is to use the Acorns app to start saving. It will round up any purchases you make to the next dollar and use that amount to invest in a diversified portfolio. Not only does this help you save, but it also gets your feet wet with investing to build a nice financial future.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Eat what you have.</h4>
Have you looked around in your kitchen lately? If so, you may notice that you really don’t need to go to the store so often, as you have plenty of uneaten food that’s just sitting there.

The “Pantry Challenge” has you avoid the store and eat what you already have. This teaches you to be resourceful, and it can also give you a firsthand glimpse into your buying mistakes.

For instance, you may notice that you buy way too much food that you never eat. By doing the Pantry Challenge, you can learn to be pickier when shopping, and you can also avoid the costly act of wasting food.
<h4>3. Stop spending for a while.</h4>
Do you find it impossible to go a day without spending? You may not purchase all necessities, either, but you spend simply out of habit or because it gives you a rush.

While it can be hard to stop this habit, the “No Spend Challenge” can slowly teach you that it is possible not to spend money every single day.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Start by picking a weekend where you’ll spend no money at all. This means nothing is spent on gas, food, entertainment, etc. You should find that you can avoid spending, and that you can occupy your time with other things that won’t put you into debt.

Once the weekend is over, compare your savings by looking at what you spent during other weekends. After you see how much you saved, you may get the motivation to do No Spend Challenges more often.","If saving money doesn’t come naturally to you, there are ways to build that financial discipline. We’ll discuss three methods that are simple yet effective, even for beginners.","2020-12-22 20:19:18",post,https://section8assist.com/3-simple-ways-to-force-yourself-to-save-money/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_749356630.jpg,shutterstock_749356630.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_749356630.jpg,599,shutterstock_749356630,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_749356630.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,3-simple-ways-to-force-yourself-to-save-money,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-03 18:20:17"

<h4>12 Ways the USDA Can Help Put Food On Your Table</h4>
As you start searching for food assistance, you’ll probably become familiar with the “USDA.” What is it? The U.S. Department of Agriculture, and it’s in charge of offering food assistance via many programs.

Sure, you may have heard of food stamps before or even WIC. But did you know that the USDA offers 12 programs that offer nutritional help to those who need it most?

You may have never had issues with putting food on the table before, but once COVID-19 hit the scene, an empty kitchen may have become your reality.

But instead of dwelling on the issue, there’s one site that can help you fix it by linking you to the right food assistance for your needs.

USA.gov is the official website of the U.S. government. You can use it for many things, but it’s particularly helpful with finding food help, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

607,"How To Switch From Renting To Owning With An Affordable HUD Home","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Has it always been your dream to own a home? If so, why not convert that fantasy into a reality?

Even though that may seem easier said than done, there are programs out there to help you become a homeowner, even if you fall into the low-income category. To help you see one such opportunity that’s out there, we’ll take a closer look at what it takes to buy an affordable HUD home so you can stop renting and start owning.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How HUD Homes Differ From Other Houses</h4>
Before we discuss what a HUD home is, let’s decode those three letters, so you know what we’re talking about. “HUD” stands for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is a government agency that lends a helping hand to low-income families.

What is the HUD most known for? Its Section 8 program that pays part of your rent to make housing a lot more accessible and affordable.

Could Section 8 rental assistance be the answer to your housing needs? If you want to make rent more affordable, yes. But if you want to own a house and become your own landlord, a HUD home is what you should focus on.

What makes a HUD home so special? Its price and the costs associated with purchasing one.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

For starters, HUD homes are usually listed below the market price for other houses in the area for one reason: To attract buyers quickly. Why does the HUD need buyers fast? Because they acquired those homes when FHA loan borrowers defaulted on their loans. And since the HUD paid off the loan balance, they need that money back as quickly as possible, which is where buyers seeking a steal can save the day.

As if low prices weren’t enough to attract buyers, HUD homes can also feature lower down payments than usual and lower closing costs. Combine all of those potential savings, and you can see how a HUD home could make it a lot cheaper to become a homeowner.

Is there a catch when it comes to HUD homes’ affordability? You could say that, as they are sold “as-is.” In short, you may need to fix them up, as the HUD will not do it for you.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Purchasing a HUD Home</h4>
If the thought of saving money when buying a house entices you, here’s what it takes to purchase a HUD home:
<ol>
 	<li>Look for houses through the HUDHomeStore.</li>
 	<li>Hire a real estate agent that’s approved by the HUD. They’ll be necessary when it comes to viewing and bidding on the home.</li>
 	<li>Get a home inspection. This will let you know if any major repairs are needed before moving in. This is a crucial step since HUD homes are sold as-is.</li>
 	<li>After winning the home auction, find financing through normal channels like VA loans, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, etc. An FHA loan can help if you have a low credit score and lack a significant down payment.</li>

626,"Could A Section 8 Voucher Help You Purchase A Home?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If there’s one expense you can’t miss every month, it’s housing. Because if you don’t pay your rent on time, your landlord will evict you. And once that happens, you’ll be living with a friend or relative or on the streets.

How can you ensure you pay the rent on time? You could save money by cutting other expenses. Or you could get an extra job or do side gigs to up your income.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

What do some people do to make their rent more affordable? They apply for Section 8 with the hopes of getting a Housing Choice Voucher. If they succeed, that voucher will ensure they only pay a certain portion of their income towards the rent.

While this may sound like an attractive option, what if you could use your Section 8 voucher to buy a home? Doing so could help you reach the dream of becoming a homeowner sooner, and it could give you a solid foundation for a nice financial future. And if you think that using that voucher to buy a home isn’t possible, know that it is since the year 2000.
<h4>The Section 8 Homeownership Program</h4>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) made the shift to allow Section 8 vouchers for homeownership 20 years ago. In doing so, they’ve helped many low-income families buy their first homes.

Could you use a Section 8 voucher to buy your first home? If you qualify for the program and meet certain income requirements, it could. The way to find this out is to contact your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA). They will help you apply for Section 8 and determine if you’re eligible, so contact them as soon as possible.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->
<h4>Is Section 8 Homeownership the Right Fit for You?</h4>
Although the thought of getting a voucher to help pay your mortgage so you can buy a home sounds great, some drawbacks come with the Section 8 Homeownership Program.

To start, some lenders may not want to work with a PHA and help you get a loan. This could become an obstacle as you search for financing. Why would you need financing? Because your homeownership voucher will pay a portion of your housing expenses, not all of them.

Another drawback to a homeownership voucher is that it may not get you into your dream home. You will be limited by what you can buy, so expensive real estate markets may be out of reach for now.

If you were looking to move into a new home immediately, a voucher might not fill your needs. Waiting lists can be so long that you could be waiting years to receive your voucher.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

With those drawbacks out of the way, let’s look at the main advantages of a Section 8 voucher for homeownership. You gain pride in owning a home, and you can build equity with the investment.

You’ll get a housing partner to help you throughout the process. You can look for better neighborhoods when buying versus renting. And since Section 8 requires classes when using a homeownership voucher, you can learn a lot about personal finance and owning a home, so your financial future becomes more secure.","Have you been thinking about applying for Section 8 rental assistance?

After COVID-19 caused record job loss and caused many to see drastic drops in their incomes, it became rather obvious that now is the time to <a href=""https://section8assist.com/these-3-challenges-make-saving-affordable-and-easy-to-do/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">start saving up for a rainy day</a>.

Where can you begin to save? Many choose to cut their entertainment expenses. And while that’s a great way to free up money in your budget, we’ll discuss how to cut your car insurance costs instead.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Steps To Lower Your Auto Insurance Costs</h3>
Since you can’t cut car insurance costs altogether, you’ll need to shave dollars and cents off your premium. These steps will help you do just that:
<h4>1. Get in touch with your insurance agent.</h4>
Start at the source. Contact your current insurance company and tell them you want to reduce your premium. Before you call, have your policy handy, so you can look over it when talking to the agent.

Ask for any discounts for your affiliation with groups, the military, etc. Your agent should be able to list moves you can make to lower your premium, such as increasing your deductible or cutting unnecessary coverage. For example, if you cut roadside assistance, rental car coverage, and comprehensive or collision coverage, you could see significant savings.

Before making any changes, check with your agent first to ensure you keep what’s needed for your location. And before you hang up, get a quote for what your new payment would be.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Shop around.</h4>
With your new potential quote from your current auto insurance provider in hand, now’s the time to see what competitors have to offer. You can do this online rather quickly without having to call each company separately.
<h4>3. Consider usage-based insurance.</h4>
Are you driving a lot less due to COVID-19? Does your car spend more time parked than it does on the road? If so, usage-based insurance could save you money if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year.

Many larger companies now offer this type of car insurance for people looking to save. One example is Progressive’s Snapshot program. Keep in mind that your driving habits may be tracked if you choose this option, so the insurance company knows that you’re not driving too frequently.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Take a driving course.</h4>
Insurance companies reward drivers for good behavior. Besides avoiding accidents and tickets, another way to look good in your insurance company’s eyes is to take a defensive driving course.

Such courses are rather simple, and many companies offer discounts if you complete one. If this sounds like something worth trying, call your agent before enrolling in a course. Confirm that they offer defensive driving discounts. Then ask them if they have a list of approved courses you can use. If not, you could waste your time and money on a course that the company does not recognize.","Did 2020 teach you that it’s time to cut costs and start saving for a rainy day?

633,"A Beginner’s Guide To Finding Scholarships For School","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Keep reading, and you should gain all the clarity you need to start your scholarship search.
<h4>When To Start Your Search</h4>
You don’t have to wait until the last minute to start searching for college scholarships. If you want proof of this, look no further than the fact that there are scholarships for kids who are in kindergarten. While you can start searching for scholarships years ahead, be sure to read the application requirements for age or grade level, so you don’t waste your time.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

In short, you should start looking for scholarships the second you start thinking about going to school. The earlier, the better.
<h4>How To Start Your Search</h4>
Once you decide that it’s time to start seeking money for school, you need to prepare, so you don’t wing it and go through time-consuming trial and error. If you don’t prep, you could miss out on scholarships created specifically for students with your attributes.

Make a list of all of your past accomplishments, plus what you’d like to accomplish in the future.
Add to that list your interests and activities. Since many scholarships require some form of writing when you apply, gather up any past works from your school history, such as poems, essays, projects, or papers that were a hit with your teachers. You could reuse these when applying for scholarships versus having to write something from scratch.

As for why you’re making this long list of accomplishments, goals, interests, and activities, the idea is to start searching for financial aid that links to them. Many schools, organizations, companies, and individuals create scholarships with different types of students in mind. The more specific they are to your profile, the better your chances of winning them.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Where To Find Scholarships</h4>
Now that you’re fully prepared to find scholarships, you have to know where to look. Start with the school you’re looking to attend. The financial aid is the most logical stop there, but you can also turn to on-campus alumni offices or the department where you plan to study.

Next, ask friends and family members if they know of any scholarships offered through their professional unions or employers. Once you’re finished looking at personal connections, move on to scholarship book directories that make it easy to find aid tied to your skillset and goals.

Lastly, use the Internet to find scholarships. You can search for scholarships in your field, through your school, or through large scholarship search engines to find what you’re looking for.
<h4>Before You Apply</h4>
To increase your chances of winning a scholarship, contact the committee or organization behind it. Ask them what they’re looking for in the ideal candidate so you can mold your application to fit that mold. As a bonus, simply contacting them and showing initiative could rule in your favor.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How To Make Your Application Stand Out</h4>
Besides doing some research to see what a scholarship committee is looking for, be sure to emphasize the future in your application. For example, if you’re writing an essay, discuss how you plan to use your education to impact other people’s lives in the years to come. Committees look for such statements so their scholarship funds can impact more than just one person.

Even if a scholarship application doesn’t require an essay, try to inject this “Why you?” statement into it somehow. It’ll help you stand out from the crowd and show the committee that their funds will be well spent by selecting you as the scholarship winner.","Are you ready to advance your education, but you have no clue how to find scholarships that’ll finance it?

636,"Can You Get Scholarships If You’re Studying Online?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The Internet has become incredibly convenient when it comes to learning. So much so that many are choosing online learning versus the traditional in-class setting to get their degrees.

If you have children, getting your degree online is ideal, as you get to set your own schedule. You can take classes from the comfort of your couch and keep an eye on your kids simultaneously, which saves you a ton of cash on costly childcare.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Is childcare the only cost-cutting benefit of distance learning? No, as you also get to eliminate the transportation expense with getting to class, and there’s no need to relocate close to campus either.

Do these money-saving benefits mean that getting your degree online is cheap? Unfortunately, the answer is no, as you still have to take care of tuition costs, books, fees, etc.

While you could take out student loans to finance your online degree, you’ll have to pay them back in the future with interest. This can put you in a financial hole as you start your professional career, which is why it’s better to apply for scholarships to fund your education.

Yes, you can get scholarships, even if you’re an online student. In fact, many scholarships available to traditional on-campus students can also be had by those learning virtually. For this article, we’ll focus on online scholarships to show you some possibilities. Then, you can hit the Net and start your own online scholarship search so you can begin applying as soon as possible.

640,"3 Ways To Buy A Home With Help From The Government","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Ask most people if they’d rather rent a home or buy one, and they’d probably pick the second option. Why? Because owning a home gives you a piece of property that can grow in value. It can give you a feeling of pride that comes with owning something. And it can also make you feel more comfortable and at peace knowing that where you lay your head at night is actually yours.

What keeps people from owning a home versus renting one then? It’s not the desire to do so, but a lack of funds to make homeownership a reality. Well, whether you feel you lack the money to make a down payment on a home or the income to pay a monthly mortgage, there’s good news: You can get help from the government to become a homeowner and stop being a renter via these three programs:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. FHA Loans</h4>
Unless you have loads of cash sitting around, you’ll probably need a loan to buy a home. What’s one problem with many loans? Strict requirements that don’t make them easily accessible.

With FHA loans from the Federal Housing Administration, you can get the financial help you need without the strictness that comes with other loans.

How are FHA loans more accessible? You don’t need a superb credit score to qualify for starters, which is excellent news if you have a few blemishes on your report. Down payments are also lower, as you can secure an FHA loan with as low as 3.5 percent of the house’s purchase price as your deposit. Lastly, FHA loans often feature closing costs lower than other loan types, and some of those costs may be covered to help you even more.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. HUD Homes</h4>
Besides the strictness associated with many loans, this can keep you from becoming a homeowner: The rising cost of real estate. How can you overcome it? By buying an affordable HUD home.

What’s a HUD home? It’s a property owned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department can take ownership of a home if the owner defaults on their FHA loan. Why can they do this? Because the HUD oversees FHA loans.

As a side note, HUD homes are also called HUD real estate owned (REO) properties. They’re worth a look since the HUD will usually list them below market price to recoup their costs quickly.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Homeownership Voucher Program</h4>
You may have heard of the Housing Choice Voucher Program or Section 8. It’s a HUD program that makes rent more affordable. With the Homeownership Voucher Program, the HUD makes owning a home more affordable.

Even if you’re living in public housing or come from a low-income household, you can still own a home, thanks to this HUD program. If you qualify, you can get help with meeting your mortgage payments or paying other expenses.","You may feel like you’re all alone when it comes to your dream of buying a home. The good news is that you’re not, as the government can help make the entire process a lot more affordable.","2021-01-20 20:07:51",post,https://section8assist.com/3-ways-to-buy-a-home-with-help-from-the-government/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1414418567.jpg,shutterstock_1414418567.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1414418567.jpg,641,shutterstock_1414418567,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1414418567.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,3-ways-to-buy-a-home-with-help-from-the-government,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-03-19 20:29:56"
643,"These Mistakes Can Keep You From Getting The Scholarships You Need","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The thought of getting free money to complete your education can be exciting. But once you start to search for scholarships, some of that excitement may fade.

Why? Because wading through all of the available scholarships can be daunting. And even though there are so many out there, you may not find any that fit your needs.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Well, before you give up on your scholarship search, know that there are ways to improve it. And this improvement process begins by avoiding these mistakes when trying to find financial aid.
<h4>1. Skipping over scholarships due to their titles.</h4>
When looking for financial aid, don’t assume that you’ll find scholarships with names that are a perfect fit for your situation. For instance, some scholarships may have names that seem completely out of your range. They may seem like they’re intended for other types of students, when you could actually be eligible as well.

A perfect example of this is the AES Engineering Scholarship. Just by looking at its name, you’d think you have to be an engineering student to qualify for the award. However, a closer look at the scholarship shows that it’s open to all fields of study. In other words, you could get this scholarship even if you’re studying nursing and not engineering. But if you skipped over it due to having “Engineering” in its name, you’d never know that.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Want another example? How about Lounge Lizard’s Web Design Scholarship. Again, by looking at the name, you’d think you have to be a web design student to qualify. A closer look at the eligibility rules shows that you don’t have to be, though. All that’s needed to qualify is to submit a web design file, which you could easily do, regardless of your field of study.

In short, read the eligibility requirements for all scholarships. You could find several diamonds in the rough that could put a huge dent in your college costs.
<h4>2. Only searching for scholarships in your field.</h4>
When starting your scholarship search, it’s a good idea to look for financial aid in your study field. So, if you’re going after your nursing degree, a quick search for “nursing scholarships” would be a smart move. However, making that your only move is a mistake, as you can find many more scholarships outside of that limited scope.

Think outside of the box when doing your search. If nursing is your field, look for scholarships in health care. If you’re studying accounting, look for finance or business scholarships. By expanding your scope, you open the door to more financial aid opportunities.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Stopping your search prematurely.</h4>
Scholarships differ in many ways. Some may be for high school students, while some may be for college sophomores or adults looking to go back to school. Keeping this in mind, you should never stop searching for scholarships until you get your degree.

By searching throughout each step of your college journey, you can keep finding scholarships to make it much more affordable.","If you think your scholarship options are limited, think again. Avoid these common mistakes, and you should be able to find all the scholarships you need to get your degree without going broke.","2021-07-15 03:15:52",post,https://section8assist.com/these-mistakes-can-keep-you-from-getting-the-scholarships-you-need/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1167938926.jpg,shutterstock_1167938926.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1167938926.jpg,644,shutterstock_1167938926,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1167938926.jpg,"Benefits Assistance",Education,publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,these-mistakes-can-keep-you-from-getting-the-scholarships-you-need,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:50:19"

There was a shift to online learning before the coronavirus hit the scene. Now that it’s here, even more people are looking to get their degrees online.

While safety is one benefit of online education, so is the ability to cut your costs in more ways than one. Without having to go to class or be on campus, you can stay where you are and avoid relocation costs.

You can cut your transportation expenses. And if you have kids to look after, you can reduce childcare costs by studying at home while keeping an eye on them. To top it all off, you can also create your own schedule.

If you’re putting your life back together after a felony conviction, you’re probably wondering about your housing options. After all, everyone needs a place to sleep, and you’ll need it for stability so you can work, start saving, etc.

One housing option that’s quite popular is Section 8, which is widely known for its vouchers. Should you qualify for a Housing Choice Voucher, you would only have to allocate a small portion of your income towards rent (usually 30 percent). The rest of your income could be used to build up savings, buy reliable transportation, and more.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Now that you know the main benefit of Section 8, let’s dive deeper into how you can qualify for it with a felony. More importantly, we’ll also look at cases where you can get your voucher quickly to get that much-desired stability soon.
<h4>Does Section 8 Accept Felons?</h4>
You can qualify for Section 8 if you have a felony conviction. Certain felonies are more damaging than others, such as sexual offenses, violence, drug trafficking, etc. You may also have a hard time getting a housing voucher if your felony is recent and occurred within the last five years.
<h4>What’s Needed to Get Section 8?</h4>
Even if you didn’t have a felony, you would still have to meet specific requirements to qualify for a Housing Choice Voucher. These requirements may differ according to your Public Housing Agency (PHA), but they tend to call for citizenship, earning less than half of the median income for an area, and not having a history of issues with drugs or alcohol. Evictions can also negatively impact your application.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How Can You Get a Housing Voucher Quickly?</h4>
It’s not surprising that so many people apply for Section 8 benefits. Since it can pay for most of your monthly rent expenses, applications far exceed vouchers. With so much demand, the typical processing time can be as long as two years. There are ways to speed this up, though.

It may not fit the mold of “emergency rent assistance,” but you can get Section 8 benefits within months or even weeks instead of years.
To do so, you will have to make the priority waiting list, which is reserved for applicants that are veterans, disabled, seniors, displaced due to disaster, homeless, facing eviction, victims of abuse, and so on.

Any of those circumstances (the more, the better) can speed up your voucher application. You can also get Section 8 benefits quicker than usual by getting a caseworker, applying to several PHAs simultaneously, or keeping in contact with your PHA every week.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Section 8 is extremely helpful for those lucky enough to receive it. Don’t let your felony make you think it’s impossible to receive these benefits. Instead, contact your PHA now to get the ball rolling. If you have any exceptional circumstances, you could receive that voucher and move into your new apartment before you know it.","Many people use Section 8 to make rent affordable, but what about felons?

654,"How To Get Federal Student Aid As An Adult","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you were thinking about getting your degree but are worried about your age, here’s some great news: Most federal student aid has no age limit. In other words, it doesn’t matter if you’re in your forties and are going back to school, as you can still get financial help as if you were twenty years younger.

Even better than the lack of age limits is the fact that you can apply for federal student aid without paying a thing, as all it takes is a bit of time to fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to get the ball rolling.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Lastly, there’s no need to worry about your financial past, either. Nobody will check your credit when applying for federal student aid, so any fears about a low score or missed payments should dissipate.
<h3>The Types of Student Aid Offered by the Government</h3>
Federal student aid falls into three main categories. The one you may be most familiar with is student loans. You’ll have to pay these back with interest, so they do come with a cost.

After loans come grants, which may be the best of the bunch since you do not have to pay them back. They act as free money to help finance your education.

Last but not least are work-study programs. These are jobs you can work during school to help pay for your college expenses.
<h4>Applying for Federal Student Aid</h4>
As mentioned, it doesn’t cost a thing to apply for student aid from the government, and you can kick start the process by completing your FAFSA form. Pay close attention to the submission deadlines on the page. If you miss them, you could be left out in the cold when it comes to college cash.

Why is the FAFSA so important? Because it’s what determines your financial need, a factor that ties in greatly with student aid. States and schools will use your FAFSA info to determine what assistance, if any, you qualify for.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Using Federal Aid To Pay for Your Student Expenses</h4>
Federal student aid can come in handy in various ways, as it can help pay for your:
<ul>
 	<li>Tuition</li>
 	<li>Books</li>
 	<li>Fees</li>
 	<li>Housing</li>
 	<li>Transportation</li>
 	<li>Computer equipment</li>
 	<li>Dependent care</li>
 	<li>Disability-related costs</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
As you can see, there are plenty of costs when going to school, which is why you should prioritize completing your FAFSA form as soon as possible.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Other Ways To Cut College Costs</h4>
While the government can help you make college more affordable, you can do some other things to keep more money in your pocket while pursuing your education:
<ul>
 	<li>Look for scholarships and grants from your state, schools, private organizations, and nonprofits.</li>
 	<li>Go to community college to reduce tuition costs.</li>
 	<li>Ask your employer if they offer tuition assistance.</li>
 	<li>See if you have any federal tax income credits for expenses linked to education.</li>
 	<li>Enroll in school as a part-time student so you can work as well.</li>
</ul>","Student aid from the federal government can make going back to college a lot more affordable and less stressful.

Whether your child is just starting school in kindergarten or is close to finishing up as a high school senior, one thing holds: They need proper nutrition.

Without it, functioning can be almost impossible, which is why the U.S. Department of Agriculture has stepped in with the following forms of food assistance for K-12 kids:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>National School Lunch Program</h4>
Imagine going to school and seeing all of your friends enjoying lunch while you have nothing to eat. Kids from low-income families have the potential to experience this problem in real life, but <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/national-school-lunch-program-nslp"" rel=""noopener"">thanks to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP)</a>, it doesn’t have to be a reality.

With the NSLP, kids who qualify can enjoy lunches that are nutritionally balanced every day. Even better, those lunches come at no cost or free, so their parents can keep more money in their pockets for other necessities.

<h4>School Breakfast Program</h4>
While getting free or affordable school lunches is great, nothing beats a healthy breakfast. After all, many claim that this AM meal is the most important of the day.  <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program-sbp"" rel=""noopener"">Through the School Breakfast Program (SBP)</a>, qualifying kids can get this essential meal for free every morning before that first class bell rings.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Special Milk Program</h4>
Have you looked at the price of milk lately? It’s quite costly. And since it’s also quite essential for strong bones and muscles, milk is an item that you can’t easily skip over at the grocery store.

<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/smp/special-milk-program"" rel=""noopener"">The Special Milk Program (SMP)</a> offers milk to kids who attend childcare institutions or schools. It’s worth noting that you cannot participate in other forms of meal service assistance from the federal government to qualify for this program.

<h4>Child and Adult Care Food Program</h4>
Getting free or low-cost meals at school is critical for kids from low-income households. But what about those who attend other institutions too? For instance, places like emergency shelters, childcare centers, afterschool programs, and the like – is there something available for those kids? There sure is, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp"" rel=""noopener"">it’s called the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which you can read more about here.</a>

<h4>Summer Food Service Program</h4>
Just because the summer hits doesn’t mean your child-related expenses stop. Your kids still need to eat, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-food-service-program"" rel=""noopener"">with the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP)</a>, they can continue to do so with free meals and snacks that are guaranteed to be healthy.

<h4>Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program</h4>
When you look around a grocery store, you may notice something: Junk food is cheap, while healthy food usually isn’t. Sure, you can fill up a shopping cart with cheap carbs that are void of nutrients, but what about fresh fruits and veggies your kids need to perform at their peak?

With <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/ffvp/fresh-fruit-and-vegetable-program"" rel=""noopener"">the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP)</a>, the USDA helps kids get a taste of fresh produce that they may not get the opportunity to eat.

662,"7 Improvements To Food Assistance Programs From President Biden","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

COVID-19 has negatively impacted our lives in many ways, but one of the biggest problems it has caused is with food. If you need proof, watch a video of lines of cars outside of food distribution centers, and you’ll see that many families are struggling to stay fed.

President Joe Biden wasted no time addressing the current food insecurity problem, as he put forth the following changes that could ensure that your nutritional needs stay met.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. More Food Stamps</h4>
The old stigma with food stamps may have kept many from applying for them, but once the coronavirus hit, that changed. Why? Because we need food to survive, and when you can’t buy your own, applying for food stamps is one of the most logical options.

With food stamps, you can receive funds every month to buy groceries. And even though Congress approved a 15 percent hike in food stamp benefits last spring, it didn’t apply to almost 40 percent of SNAP recipients. Even worse, that Congress approval left out the lowest-income households, which meant a change was needed.

President Biden provided that change with the signing of an order to increase SNAP allotments to states. Under the order, states will get more funding for food stamps so their citizens won’t have to suffer.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Families aren’t the only ones struggling under the pandemic, as so is the economy. With this proposed increase in food stamps, the economy should get a nice boost, especially in the food sector. A study from the USDA showed that $1 billion in new SNAP benefits could result in a $1.54 increase in the country’s GDP, which is highly-needed at the moment.
<h4>2. Food Stamps That Are Easier To Get</h4>
While an increase in food stamps is great, Biden also wants to make the program more accessible to those who need it. He plans on doing this by revising the Thrifty Food Plan that determines eligibility for benefits. Many see the plan as outdated, so to meet the needs of families currently under hardship, it will be tweaked.
<h4>3. An Extension of Increased Food Stamp Benefits</h4>
Biden’s proposed 15 percent increase in food stamps should help right now, but what about the future? The coronavirus seems as if it will stick around for a while, which is why Biden announced that he wants the increase in benefits to be extended.
<h4>4. $3 Billion Extra for WIC</h4>
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) could see a boost under Biden, as he pledged $3 billion in extra funding for it.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. $1 Billion in Food Assistance for U.S. Territories</h4>
This additional funding would greatly help those living in these areas.
<h4>6. Help for Restaurants</h4>
Biden announced that he would like to get restaurants involved in supplying food, which could help their workers and their families at the same time.
<h4>7. 15 Percent More Pandemic-EBT</h4>
The P-EBT program helps students from low-income households stay fed as free or low-priced meals from closed schools are no longer available. Biden allowed for a 15 percent increase to this program.","The Biden presidency has brought some good news with it regarding food assistance.

665,"Work From Home? Do This To Minimize Your Expenses","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Many people started working from home not by choice, but because the coronavirus appeared. Social distancing became necessary, and rather than shutting down altogether, companies told their employees to work from home versus at the office.

If you made this move, you probably noticed that working from home allows you to get the same amount of work done as at the office. Companies have noticed this too, making such an arrangement the wave of the future.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

What makes working from home ideal? First, you get more control over your schedule. Second, you can take care of your kids, avoiding the need for expensive childcare. Third, there’s no need to waste on transportation costs, since your office is right there. And fourth, you can cut back on food costs by avoiding restaurant lunches with your coworkers.

What’s the drawback of working from home? Some say it’s hard to stay disciplined or fight off distractions. But for the purpose of this article, we’ll tackle the drawback of costs you incur by having a home office, as electricity and other expenses will be coming out of your pocket.
<h4>Know Where To Find Cheap Furniture</h4>
If the shift to working at home was abrupt, you’ll probably need to buy some furniture so you can work properly. Sure, you could work on the couch or even in your bed, but that could make your productivity suffer.

Whether you need a desk, office chair, or some other equipment, buy it used online for significant savings. On a local level, you can try garage sales and second-hand stores. Even better, try Craigslist. It has a free section where people give away stuff they no longer need, and it’s usually littered with perfectly good furniture. All you need to do is pick it up, and it’s yours at no cost.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Look for Office Supply Sales</h4>
When you see a sale on office supplies, stock up. Buying in bulk almost always leads to savings, and you won’t have to worry about picking up those supplies any time soon.
<h4>Cut Your Printing Costs</h4>
Chances are, you’ll need a printer. A laser printer might be your best bet for long-term savings, so look into one. Once you have it, set your default printing to black and white draft. It’ll save a ton versus color printing that probably isn’t necessary.

Refill your print cartridges, and you’ll greatly reduce your printing costs. Get your refill packs from a discount store online for even more savings.
<h4>Avoid Temptations To Buy Prepped Food</h4>
Whether it’s an overpriced coffee or a sandwich from your favorite lunch spot, try to cook at home as much as possible. You’d be surprised at how much you can save by taking the time to make your own food instead of having someone else do it.

<h4>Save on Electricity</h4>
Open the blinds and use natural light to work. Turn off lights and appliances or devices when you’re not using them. If you leave your house, turn down the thermostat.

Every month, you find yourself either falling short of the rent or paying it late. This puts you at odds with your landlord, to the point that you fear you’ll soon be living on the streets if you don’t increase your income.

Could you get a second job to boost your income and make it easier to pay rent? Sure, and you could also do things like work side gigs, ask for extra hours at your current job, and even sell some of your stuff online for cash.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

What’s a better long-term solution to paying the rent that’s less stressful or time-consuming than those options above? Getting a Section 8 housing voucher from the government.

Section 8 is an incredibly popular government assistance program for one main reason: It makes rent affordable. Since rent takes the biggest piece of your budget’s pie each month, lowering it could make it easier to fix your finances, which is what a housing voucher can help you do.

Unlike other forms of housing assistance, Section 8 lets you pick where you live. This means that you not only get to choose between apartments, townhomes, and single-family homes, but that you’ll also be dealing with a landlord.

Let’s take a look at what a Section 8 landlord must bring to the table, as well as what you must do as a tenant. We’ll also include your Public Housing Agency (PHA) responsibilities, so you can get a better idea of how a Section 8 partnership functions.

 	<li>Provide utilities and services listed in the lease.</li>
 	<li>Manage the rental.</li>
 	<li>Abstain from collecting side payments, as they are not allowed under Section 8.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What the PHA Must Do:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Pay the landlord the voucher amount each month.</li>
 	<li>Regularly ensure that families are eligible for Section 8.</li>
 	<li>Monitor for fraud and Section 8 abuse among landlords and tenants.</li>
 	<li>Tell the landlord if the voucher amount will increase or decrease.</li>
 	<li>Provide customer service to both tenants and landlords.</li>
 	<li>Ensure the property is up to standards via inspections every two years.</li>

Imagine being able to pay your rent on time every month while also having plenty of extra cash leftover. Doing so would not only give you some much-needed peace of mind, but it would also help you save for an emergency fund, pay down debt, and more.

What could make this financial fantasy a reality? A housing voucher from the government’s Section 8 program. How does it work? The voucher gets paid directly to the landlord, and you pay whatever’s left of the rent.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

We won’t dive any deeper into how Section 8 works in this article, as you can learn more about the program <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>. What we will discuss is what takes place after you get your voucher, which is having to find a place to live and convincing the landlord to let you live there.

With a voucher in place, you can pick where you want to make your home. This opens up the door to living in a standard apartment, townhome, or even a single-family home. The place you pick will be private property. In other words, it’ll have an owner or landlord you’ll need to deal with instead of the government. So just like any other rental agreement, you’ll have to make a solid impression on the landlord before they can accept you as their next tenant.

How can you make that good impression? Here are some pointers:

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Before the Interview</h4>
There are some moves you should make before looking at potential properties or talking to landlords. Be sure to complete them as quickly as possible so you can start Section 8 house hunting:

Complete a substance abuse program – A history of substance abuse could be seen as a negative in a landlord’s eyes. By completing a program, you can show you’re on the right path.
Take classes on being a responsible renter – You can boost your resume by taking classes set up by your local Community Action Agency. They’ll teach you about renting, being a good tenant, and more, and any landlord would be pleased to know that you completed them.
Collect your credit reports – You can get free credit reports annually. You’ll need them when meeting with landlords should they ask you about past issues.
Set up the interview – With the first three steps complete and a potential home on your list, call the landlord when it’s quiet to set up the interview. Be polite and do not discuss your past problems, as it’s best to do so in person.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>During the Interview</h4>
Just like with a job interview, you’ll want to dress professionally and show up to meet the landlord 15 minutes in advance. Do not be late, as it’s an easy way to create a bad first impression.

Ask as many questions as you can about the property. Show interest in the tenant rules and what’s expected of you. If the property still interests you, ask what the next step is and how the landlord screens tenants. If they start asking you questions about past rentals, don’t badmouth your previous landlords and accept responsibility for any issues.

Close out the interview by asking the landlord what your chances are. If they’re not good, ask what’s needed to improve them so they can accept your Section 8 voucher and you can move in.","Getting approved for a Section 8 housing voucher only means you’re halfway home.

682,"These Driving Habits Can Save You Money On Gas","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Trips to the gas station have become more painful as of late due to increasing fuel prices. You could wait and hope that those prices eventually come down, or you could follow these driving tips to cut your gas consumption:
<h4>1. Don’t speed.</h4>
It may not be fun to drive the speed limit. And it may not get you to your destination quicker, especially if you’re in a rush. But driving fast increases wind resistance, which can decrease your car’s fuel economy.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Be gentle with the pedal.</h4>
In keeping with the non-speeding theme, don’t accelerate quickly. The harder you accelerate, the more fuel you’ll use.
<h4>3. Learn to coast.</h4>
You don’t always have to have your foot on the gas pedal. If you plan ahead for turns and stops, you can lay off the gas and coast. This gives you better gas mileage. And by avoiding a driving pattern that includes constant accelerations and stops, you can give your brakes a bit of a break, saving you on repairs down the line.
<h4>4. Plan your trips.</h4>
You can cut down on trips, which cuts down on fuel consumption by planning. For instance, if you know you have several errands to run, try to group them versus spreading them out.

If you work near the grocery store, you can make your shopping trip Friday instead of doing it separately on a Saturday. This not only saves gas, but it can save you time too.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>5. Don’t idle.</h4>
Do you turn your car on and sit there for several minutes? This idling can waste gas and probably isn’t necessary.

If you do it to play with your phone before taking off in the morning, do it inside your home instead.
Then, when you’re ready to go, jump in your car and take off without the gas-wasting idling.
<h4>6. Carpool.</h4>
This is one of the oldest and easiest ways to save money on gas. You can carpool with coworkers, other parents to take your kids to school, and so on.

Carpooling saves money, but it also gives you a break from having to drive every single day. That alone makes it worth it.
<h4>7. Use cruise control.</h4>
You can give your bank account and foot a break by using cruise control on longer drives. The steady speed improves gas mileage, and it also ensures you don’t speed so you can miss out on getting a costly ticket.

One area where cruise control may not improve your gas mileage is where it’s hilly due to excessive downshifting. Other than that, you’re good to go.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. Use your windows more.</h4>
Some say using your windows creates drag and decreases gas mileage. This is true, but usually at higher speeds. At lower speeds when cruising through the city, lowering your windows and turning the AC off could help you save some cents on gas.","Have the high gas prices made you think of ways to cut your fuel costs?

799,"How To Find Quick COVID-19 Relief","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Many of us thought the coronavirus would have disappeared a long time ago. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, as it’s still going strong nearly one year since its appearance.

Have things started to open up? A little bit. But you may live in an area with more stringent restrictions. Or you may work in an industry where it’s tough to make a living due to the continued shutdowns.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Some say you should wait for stimulus checks. But a single payment of a couple of thousand dollars probably won’t get you very far. That’s why you need to know where to find COVID-19 relief until you can get steady work and things go back to normal.

Although there are more resources for coronavirus relief than those in this list, use it as a starting point. Contact each resource and tell them your situation. If they can help you, great. And if they cannot, ask them if they have any recommendations on finding COVID-19 assistance.
<h3>Where to Turn for Quick COVID-19 Relief</h3>
<h4>Call 211</h4>
While 911 may be the most critical three-digit phone number, 211 isn’t far behind. Why? Because it’s the number to call when you need emergency assistance with finding affordable housing, healthcare, food, bill-paying aid, and much more.

Call 211 to speak with a local operator. Once they’re on the line, tell them what you need help with. Since they are experts in emergency assistance, they should be able to tell you where to go to fill your needs quickly.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

You can learn more about 211’s assistance services by <a href=""https://www.211.org/get-help/help-during-covid-19-pandemic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">visiting their website</a> and reading their page created specifically for COVID-19 relief.
<h4>Find Food Banks Near You</h4>
Food banks have been around for some time, providing families in need with nutrition assistance. The coronavirus made it hard for food banks to operate due to safety measures. But they’re still providing food assistance for those who need it most.

Feeding America has compiled an enormous list of food banks from coast to coast. <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">See it here</a> so you can start contacting local food banks today.
<h4>Modest Needs</h4>
Imagine getting a grant to help you pay bills, buy food, etc., during the coronavirus pandemic. It would surely make life more comfortable, and Modest Needs is an organization that provides such assistance.

Modest Needs takes donations and uses them to help people in need. Share your hardship story with this organization, and you could be the next family to receive help.

<h4>The Salvation Army</h4>
When you think of organizations that offer assistance in tough times, the Salvation Army is at the top of the list. They’ve helped others through homeless shelters and soup kitchens for some time now. And while they may have scaled back a little due to coronavirus safety measures, you can still <a href=""https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/plugins/gdosCenterSearch?start=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact the Salvation Army near you</a> to see if they can help with meal delivery, food boxes, emotional support, and more.","Has the COVID-19 pandemic made it nearly impossible to provide for your family?

802,"New FCC Program Makes Pandemic Internet More Affordable","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The FCC recently announced the creation of the Emergency Broadband Benefit. Its main aim is to aid households struggling to pay for Internet service since the coronavirus arrived. Once it kicks in, the Emergency Broadband Benefit will connect those in need with such necessities as virtual classrooms, healthcare services, and jobs.
<h3>What the Emergency Broadband Benefit Will Provide</h3>
Eligible households will receive up to a $50 discount towards broadband Internet service under this program. That discount jumps to $75 per family on Tribal lands.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Also, eligible households can enjoy a one-time discount of up to $100 towards purchasing a tablet, desktop computer, or laptop. The device will have to come from a participating provider to receive this discount, and the recipient will have to pay $10 to $50 out of pocket towards the purchase.

Each household will be limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount.
<h3>Eligibility for the Emergency Broadband Benefit</h3>
To be eligible for the FCC’s new program, one of the following must apply to at least one member of the household:
<ul>
 	<li>Won a Federal Pell Grant (must be during the current award year).</li>
 	<li>Either during the current year or the 2019-2020 school year received benefits from the school breakfast program or the free and reduced lunch program.</li>
 	<li>Meets a participating provider’s eligibility criteria for an existing COVID-19 or low-income program.</li>
 	<li>Is eligible for the FCC’s Lifeline program.</li>
 	<li>Suffered from a significant loss of income since February 29, 2020, with total household income below $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers.</li>
</ul>
As for when the Emergency Broadband Benefit will begin, that’s still up in the air. They hope to make it available as quickly as possible, so stay tuned.

<h3>Other Low-Cost Internet Options</h3>
In the meantime, there are other ways to get affordable Internet during the pandemic. For starters, you can get in touch with your current provider and ask if they offer any discounts or payment plans to make your bill more manageable. You can also look into the following programs:
<h4>Mediacom Connect 2 Compete</h4>
You can get reliable, fast Internet with speeds up to 25Mbps through this program for $9.95 per month. If you have children participating in the National School Lunch Program, that’s all you need to qualify. No deposit, installation/rental fees, or contract are necessary.

How much do you pay each month for Internet? Whatever the amount, you probably wish it was lower so you could cut your monthly costs, especially during these tough pandemic times. And while you could have cut your Internet altogether in the past to save money, that may not be possible now. Why? Because you probably need it for work and school purposes.

It’s no secret that COVID-19 caused us to shift our lives when it comes to work and school. Many offices were shut down initially as a safety precaution. And since companies saw that working from home was practical and affordable, many have decided to make this move permanent. So if you need to work from home, you’ll need the Internet.

Making up lost income from the pandemic can be challenging. As bills piled up, revenue went down due to all of the shutdowns. And now that many companies want those bills paid after giving you a bit of breathing room, you may be wondering how you’ll do it.

You can put a small dent in your bills with COVID-19 Economic Impact Payments. These stimulus checks have been authorized by the government twice now. To get you up to speed, here are some of the details:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>When They Were Announced</h4>
The first set of Economic Impact Payments were made official last March. The second set was finalized in December 2020.
<h4>How Much They’re Worth</h4>
The first stimulus checks offered $1,200 per eligible adult and $500 per dependent child. The second round dropped the adult payout to $600 and raised the child payout to $600.
<h4>How to Calculate Your Stimulus Payments</h4>
If there are two adults and three children in your family, this is what your first stimulus check would equal:

$1,200 + $1,200 + $500 + $500+ $500 = $3,900

Your second check would equal:

$600 + $600 + $600 + $600 + $600 = $3,000

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Stimulus Check Eligibility</h4>
It’s unfortunate, but not everyone is eligible for Economic Impact Payments. To qualify, you’ll need to be a U.S. citizen or resident alien with a valid Social Security number. You can’t be claimed as a dependent on someone’s taxes, and your adjusted gross income must fall within these limits:
<ul>
 	<li>Make less than $75,000 as an individual.</li>
 	<li>Make less than $112,500 as a head of household.</li>
 	<li>Make less than $150,000 as a married couple filing jointly.</li>
</ul>
You could still qualify if your income surpasses those limits. Your payout will be reduced, however. Here are the maximums for income before you’re disqualified:
<ul>
 	<li>$99,000 for individuals</li>
 	<li>$136,500 for heads of households</li>
 	<li>$198,000 for married couples filing jointly</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stimulus Payment Methods</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Check by mail</li>
 	<li>Prepaid debit card by mail</li>
 	<li>Direct deposit to the bank account used to receive your tax refund or federal benefits</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Delays in Stimulus Payments</h4>
If your payment is missing and you meet the eligibility requirements, make sure you filed your 2020 tax return. For free assistance, go to MyFreeTaxes or contact:
<ul>
 	<li>IRS-certified volunteers</li>
 	<li>211 Economic Impact Payment Helpline at 844-322-3639</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Use Your Stimulus Checks</h4>
Since the pandemic has probably been hard on your finances, you should use your stimulus payments to make the following moves:
<ol>
 	<li>Buy groceries.</li>
 	<li>Buy other household essentials.</li>
 	<li>Pay past due bills for rent, mortgage, utilities, car, insurance.</li>
 	<li>Pay upcoming bills.</li>
 	<li>Create an emergency fund.</li>
 	<li>Open a personal savings account that earns interest.</li>
</ol>

If the pandemic has done one thing, it’s shown us what’s important. Not only have we realized how essential our health and sticking close to family is, but we’ve also placed a priority on nutrition. Why? Because many of us have seen our nutrition suffer since the coronavirus came around and made it harder to afford food.

Whether your food is about to run out or you want to set up nutritional stability for the future, these resources can help in these times of need:

<h3>Long-Term Food Assistance Solutions</h3>
We’ll get into short-term food assistance solutions in a minute. But first, let’s talk about your future.

You may have had issues with feeding your family before COVID-19 appeared. If this is the case, your best bet is to apply for a food assistance program to help you each month, even once the coronavirus is gone. Here are some of the most popular programs around that fit a wide variety of needs:
<h4>For Low-Income Families: SNAP</h4>
Food stamps (SNAP) have been around for a while. And if you’ve never needed them in the past, that may have changed with the pandemic as you fight to put food on the table.

How can food stamps provide nutritional stability? By giving you funds on an EBT card each month that you can take to the store to buy healthy foods. As you can imagine, this can take a massive load off of your back by ensuring your family stays fed, which is why you should <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">apply for food stamps</a> now to start receiving those benefits soon.

As a side note, the government recently made food stamps easier to qualify for while also increasing the benefits to help families during the pandemic. In short, don’t delay in submitting your application.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Your income may have stopped coming in once all of the coronavirus shutdowns kicked in, but your bills probably didn’t. As they began to pile up, you probably wondered how you’d pay them all without losing any of your essential services like electricity, water, Internet, etc.

Even though the pandemic has been a struggle for most of us, there are things you can do to make your bills more manageable. Have a look:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Call Your Companies</h4>
What’s the worst move you can make with bills that pile up during the pandemic? Letting them pile up even more. In short, you can’t ignore your bills and expect them to disappear. You have to get in touch with the companies to let them know your issues so they can come up with solutions.

Many companies have come up with strategies to help households struggling with the pandemic. Give yours a call, whether it’s the power company, water company, or Internet or phone provider, and let them know your financial problems. They should give you a list of options that may include payment plans, discounts, or postponing your bills. Any of those can help until you find more ways to bring in income.

What happens if the company says they don’t have any payment plans or discounts you can take advantage of? Ask them if they know of any local nonprofits that can help. If so, you could find the bill-paying assistance you need just by asking an additional question.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Call 211</h4>
It’s easy to get overwhelmed right now. Not only do you have to worry about your health with the coronavirus floating around, but you also have to find ways to pay bills with little in your bank account.

If figuring out your finances or dealing with all of your bills is too much to handle, getting an expert on the phone may be your best move. 211 has a team of local operators that can give you the exact contacts you need to get assistance paying bills, finding low-cost housing, and much more.
<h4>See if You Qualify for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program</h4>
LIHEAP helps low-income families cut their heating and cooling costs. In doing so, you can get major help with your utility bill, so it doesn’t break your budget.

You can see if you’re eligible for LIHEAP by <a href=""https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going here</a>. If so, you can also get help with boosting your home's energy efficiency, which will lower your future bills.
<h4>Get Cheaper Internet</h4>
You may be happy with your current Internet service. But the bill may be so high that you cannot afford it.

Since you may need the Internet to work from home during the pandemic or your kids could need it for school, stay connected by opting for something cheaper.

You can get fast Internet service for just $10 per month. Here are some programs that offer online connectivity that won’t break the bank: Access from AT&amp;T, Comcast Internet Essentials, Mediacom Connect 2 Compete, Verizon Lifeline, and EveryoneOn.

<h4>Stop Paying So Much for Your Phone</h4>
Your cell phone or landline may be lifesavers during the pandemic, as they help you stay connected with friends and family from a distance. You may find your phone bills to be too expensive for your budget, however, which is why you should look into the FCC’s Lifeline program. It offers low-cost phone service and may even give you a free phone.","How can you keep up with your utility, Internet, and phone bills when the coronavirus pandemic has emptied your pockets?","2021-07-15 03:50:28",post,https://section8assist.com/how-to-get-help-paying-your-utilities-internet-and-phone-bills/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_631652708.jpg|https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_546537427.jpg,shutterstock_631652708.jpg|shutterstock_546537427.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_631652708.jpg|/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_546537427.jpg,892|815,"Online,Bill,Payment,Concept.hands,Holding,Mobile,Phone,On,Blurred,Electric|shutterstock_546537427",|,|,|,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_631652708.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","Covid Relief",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,how-to-get-help-paying-your-utilities-internet-and-phone-bills,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 13:46:57"
821,"Insider Tips For Finding A Homeless Motel Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

But if you have no clue how to find one, we’ll do our best to give you a clearer path to achieve that goal.

Where can you turn to when you no longer have a place to sleep? This is a question many face every day as they’re evicted from their homes. And if friends and family aren’t an option, and you find a homeless shelter to be too intimidating, here’s where you may turn to: A hotel or motel voucher.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Being able to have your own hotel or motel room has its perks, as you won’t have to worry as much about safety, peace and quiet, or sanitary conditions like you would in a shelter. But since such a setting is ideal for the homeless, these vouchers come with one massive problem: They can be hard to find. Here are some insider tips to make your motel voucher search a successful one.
<h4>1. Know where to look.</h4>
Since hotel vouchers are limited, you’ll want to contact every homeless resource possible in your search. Here are the most common places to find homeless hotel vouchers:
<ul>
 	<li>Call 211</li>
 	<li>Your local homeless shelter</li>
 	<li>Catholic Charities</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army</li>
 	<li>Homeless assistance programs in your city, county, or state</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

While those are the most direct options for finding a homeless motel voucher, you could try these resources as well to see if you have any luck:
<ul>
 	<li>National Healthcare for the Homeless Council</li>
 	<li>Continuum of Care (CoC)</li>
 	<li>National Coalition for the Homeless</li>
 	<li>National Coalition for Homeless Veterans</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Know which situations increase your chances of getting a hotel voucher.</h4>
In an ideal world, every homeless person would get hotel/motel vouchers. Due to their limited availability, that’s not the case.

Agencies that offer hotel vouchers sometimes prioritize certain groups, such as single parents, single men, seniors, and the disabled. They may also limit hotel vouchers to victims of disasters, such as floods, fires, or hurricanes. Or they may give motel vouchers to victims of domestic violence or abuse before other applicants. If you fit any of the groups or situations described above, be sure to mention it when contacting homeless resources, as this information could put you at the front of the voucher line.
<h4>3. Know how to keep your voucher.</h4>
The last thing you want to have happen is to work hard to get a voucher and then lose it for not following rules. Many agencies require hotel voucher recipients to check in with them. You may need to show that you’re employed or are trying to find work. And you may need to meet with a counselor to create a plan to end your homelessness.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Know what to expect.</h4>
Paying for hotel or motel rooms for the homeless is very expensive. Agencies do not have unlimited funds, which is why hotel/motel vouchers usually only give you three nights maximum of lodging. Keep this in mind when performing your search. Be sure to ask your contacts for longer-term housing solutions so you can gain stability until you get back on your feet.","You probably know that a hotel voucher could help make your homeless situation more manageable.

832,"Before You Buy A Used Car, Read This","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Is it better to buy a used car or a new car? That’s a common question amongst those in the market for a vehicle. And while a new car may appeal more to our senses with its unique scent and shiny paint job, here’s the truth: New cars are a lot more expensive.

How expensive are new cars? According to Kelley Blue Book, quite expensive, as the average new car came in at $39,000 last year. As if that high price wasn’t bad enough, new cars present another problem: Depreciation.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

In just its first year, a new car can lose 20 percent of its value. So why not let the original owner swallow that depreciation and buy used instead?

There’s no shame in buying a used car anymore. In fact, plenty of used cars can be just as good as new with low mileage and even warranties to cover repairs. There are some things to consider when buying a used vehicle, though, and we’ll look at those now.
<h3>Tips to Buy a Used Car Without Getting Ripped Off</h3>
Are there pitfalls when it comes to buying a used car? Sure. But that doesn’t mean you can’t get a great deal and reliable transportation in the process. Follow these tips, and you’ll reduce the risk of driving a lemon.
<h4>1. Know when to buy.</h4>
You can get a great deal on a used car by shopping at certain times. Holidays seem to be sweet spots for used car sales, so if you can wait until July 4th, Memorial Day, or Labor Day, do so.

The end of months and quarters are also great times to shop for used cars since dealerships want to hit their quotas.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

What about when the model year ends? That’s around September and October. With brand new cars coming in, dealerships will want to clear out their lots to make room. To do so, they may offer deep discounts on used inventory.

If you want to break it down by day, avoid the weekends. Lots are usually packed with customers, so you may not get the attention you seek from a salesperson. Go on the weekdays, and you’ll feel less rushed and may gain better insight into the best deals.
<h4>2. Know where to buy.</h4>
Franchised car dealerships will probably give you the most dependable used cars, especially compared to small independent lots that may be loaded with lemons. You may want to spend a bit more and get a certified pre-owned vehicle that comes with lower mileage and a warranty.

Are private sellers worth checking out? Sure, as they can often sell for less than dealerships. Just make sure you ask about the car’s history and get a record of maintenance. Make sure the title is clear and in the seller’s name too. To be extra careful, order a Carfax of the vehicle and have your mechanic take a look at it.

To see what’s out there, visit online sites like Autotrader, Carfax, and Kelley Blue Book. You can use them to sort through cars within your budget and schedule test drives.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Avoid overpaying.</h4>
How can you tell if the used car you’re looking at is appropriately priced? Look at price appraisal tools from sites like Carfax, Edmunds, and Kelley Blue Book. All three can give you accurate info that can help you negotiate a better price if you feel like the one that’s advertised is too high.","A used car can save the day when you’re on a limited budget yet need reliable transportation.

837,"American Families Plan: Are Free And Nutritious Meals In Your Kids’ Future?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

President Biden could have help on the way via free school meals and his American Families Plan.

What is your number one worry right now? If you have kids, it’s probably their health. But their health may be less than optimal if they can’t get the nutrition they need.

What could stop a parent from providing this necessity? A lack of income. And since the coronavirus pandemic hit, many more households than usual are suffering from a lack of income, which negatively impacts their children’s nutrition.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>The Newly Announced American Families Plan</h3>
If you’ve turned on the news lately, you may have heard the “American Families Plan” mentioned frequently. That’s because the President just announced it, and as you can tell by its name, the plan focuses on getting families back on their feet.

The American Families Plan looks to improve the quality of life for low-income households in many ways. And while things like education and lowered taxes are essential, there’s nothing more essential than our children’s nutrition.
<h3>The American Families Plan’s Nutritional Highlights</h3>
<h4>Permanent Summer Pandemic-EBT</h4>
The coronavirus pandemic led to historical job and income loss. Families that were already toughing it out found themselves struggling even more once the pandemic hit. To make things worse, schools had to close to keep coronavirus infections from spreading in close quarters. And once those schools shuttered, many parents wondered how they would feed their kids breakfast and lunch.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Many children from low-income families rely on free and reduced-price breakfasts and lunches at school.
But once schools closed, they had to rely on getting their meals from home.

To ensure children from such households didn’t starve, Summer Pandemic-EBT stepped in to fill that gap. It did so by funding parents so they could buy food for their children to replace school meals. And while the coronavirus triggered this program, President Biden hopes to make it permanent with a $25 billion investment.

A whopping 29 million children could enjoy nutritious meals during the summer months if the American Families Plan gets approved. Such news would be huge, as studies have shown that the Pandemic-EBT program boosted children’s nutrition while decreasing food insecurity.
<h4>More Nutritious Meals Through Incentivization</h4>
Knowing that your children can enjoy complimentary meals is excellent. But what about the nutritional content? You don’t want your kids to eat just anything, as meals lacking nutrition could negatively impact their health now and in the future. That’s why the American Families Plan offers incentives to ensure schools make their meals as nutritious as possible.

Through a $1 billion investment, Biden hopes that schools will exceed nutritional standards when making their menus. In return, they could receive a higher meal reimbursement.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Free School Meals for an Extra 9.3 Million Children</h4>
President Biden wants to make school meals more accessible by reducing eligibility thresholds. If successful, the Community Eligibility Provision could feed 9.3 million more mouths through a $17 billion investment.","Are you worried that your children’s nutrition is lacking because your finances are suffering?

Here’s a summary of its primary promises that could improve your everyday life and your children’s future.
<h4>1. Pre-school for three and four-year-olds would be free.</h4>
An investment of $200 billion is proposed to make universal preschool free for all three and four-year-olds. If approved, this would provide early schooling for five million kids while saving the average family a whopping $13,000.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Beyond being free, an emphasis would be placed on quality via supportive classroom environments and low student-to-teacher ratios.
<h4>2. College students will have incentives to graduate in early childhood education.</h4>
To ensure staffing of universal preschool, the American Families Plan will offer incentives for anyone interested in becoming an early childhood educator. These incentives would include free community college, training, competitive wages, and professional development services.
<h4>3. Two years of community college would be free.</h4>
To address a decline in college enrollment, the American Families Plan would offer two years of free community college to everyone, including DREAMERs. Students would have up to four years to complete their studies. This $109 billion plan would help 5.5 million students earn a degree or credential to expand their employment opportunities.

<h4>4. Pell Grants would increase by $1,400.</h4>
Pell Grants have seen their value drop over the last 50 years. They no longer cover expenses as they used to, which is why Biden wants to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $1,400. DREAMERs would be eligible as well.
<h4>5. $62 billion would be invested to improve college retention and completion.</h4>
To help students complete their studies, the American Families Plan would tackle low college retention and completion rates via:

 	<li>Mentoring services</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Child care would become more affordable.</h4>
Parents would not have to worry as much about the high cost of child care if the American Families Plan gets approved. Child care costs would be covered entirely for families with the most financial need, while others would pay based on their income.
<h4>7. The child care workforce would improve.</h4>
Early childhood staff would receive a $15 minimum wage, professional development help, and job-embedded coaching.
<h4>8. A national paid family and medical leave program would be created.</h4>
Workers would receive up to $4,000 per month to take up to twelve weeks to deal with such issues as:
<ul>
 	<li>Bonding with a new child.</li>
 	<li>Caring for a loved one who’s seriously ill.</li>

 	<li>Dealing with a family member’s military deployment.</li>

<h4>9. Summer Pandemic-EBT would become permanent.</h4>
29 million children receiving reduced-price and free meals would get to enjoy the benefits of Summer Pandemic-EBT even when the pandemic is over. This would allow their parents to buy food over the summer when schools are closed.
<h4>10. People convicted of drug felonies would be eligible for SNAP.</h4>
Once out of prison, previously incarcerated individuals would have the chance to receive food stamps, despite drug convictions.
<h4>11. Unemployment insurance would be reformed.</h4>
The unemployment insurance system would be modernized to prevent fraud better and offer equitable access, so those who need help can get it faster during tough times.
<h4>12. Child Tax Credit increases would be extended through 2025.</h4>
Children age six and above would get a Child Tax Credit of $3,000 each, while those under six would get a $3,600 credit.","President Biden’s recently announced American Families Plan makes a ton of promises.

844,"SNAP EBT Cards: What You Need To Know","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<h4>Why You Should Apply for SNAP</h4>
Are you struggling to buy groceries each month? Do you feel like you're failing when it comes to your children’s nutrition? Have you tried cutting other expenses to make more room for food to no avail? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then you should apply for SNAP.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is just a fancy name for food stamps. Unlike food stamps from the past, though, SNAP benefits now come loaded onto EBT cards that you can swipe at participating stores.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

With SNAP, you won’t have to worry as much about putting food on the table. You’ll get monthly funds to buy groceries, which will leave more room in your budget for other expenses.

You can begin the SNAP application process by going here. You will need to meet income requirements, as SNAP is awarded based on financial need. You will also need to complete the application process with an interview.
<h4>Receiving SNAP Benefits</h4>
If you’re approved for SNAP, you will receive your EBT card via mail. Once you activate the EBT card and set up a PIN, you will be good to go.

As for how long it takes to receive SNAP benefits, that depends. You could receive them within a week, or it could take a month.
<h4>Using SNAP Benefits</h4>
Your EBT card is where your monthly funds will be sent. As such, you will want to keep it in a safe place. Many places accept EBT. In general, you can use the card at gas stations, convenience stores, and grocery stores. Walgreens, Walmart, Target, CVS, etc., may also accept EBT. And you could use it at some farmers' markets for fresh produce.

When you receive your EBT card, contact your local SNAP office. Ask if online purchases are approved in your state. The majority of states allow for this, so you may be in luck.
You can also use the SNAP Retailer Locator to find places that accept EBT in your area.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

You will be limited as to what you can buy with SNAP. The list is still long, however, as you can buy the following necessities with your EBT card:
<ul>
 	<li>Dairy</li>
 	<li>Meat</li>
 	<li>Fish</li>
 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Non-alcoholic drinks</li>
 	<li>Bread</li>
 	<li>Fruit</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Cereal</li>
 	<li>Rice</li>
 	<li>Snacks</li>
 	<li>Desserts</li>
 	<li>Condiments</li>
 	<li>Spices</li>
</ul>
Prepared foods are usually prohibited, although some states allow for fast food EBT purchases. You will not be able to use your SNAP benefits to buy alcohol, tobacco, household supplies, supplements, medication, vitamins, live animals, or health and beauty products.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

Before shopping, check your SNAP balance by calling the phone number on the back of your card. Your state may also have an app or web portal for checking the balance.

If you are traveling, your EBT card should work wherever SNAP is accepted. But if you decide to move to another state, you will have to reapply for SNAP to receive monthly benefits.","Are you unsure how SNAP (aka food stamps) and EBT cards work?

Does this mean you won’t have to pay any rent at all? No, as you’ll still have to pay back rent to your landlord, as well as any fees and interest. The moratorium simply keeps you from being evicted during this time of financial hardship for many.

The CDC Eviction Moratorium applies to single-family and multi-family properties, whether they’re privately-owned or linked to the federal government. It does not apply to people living in guest houses, hotels, and motels.

The moratorium won’t protect you automatically, as you’ll have to opt into the program to enjoy its protection. You’ll need to fill out a declaration form to prove your eligibility. Each adult in the household on the lease needs to fill out a separate form to prove difficulty making rent payments during the pandemic.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

Once complete, you must send the form to the person who has the power to evict you, such as your landlord, property manager, or property owner. Be sure to request confirmation of receipt of the document in writing.

In addition to the declaration form, you will also need to create a payment plan to get up-to-date with the rent once the moratorium is over.

It’s worth noting that the moratorium protects eviction for nonpayment of rent. You could still be evicted if you violate other terms of the lease, such as conducting criminal activity on the property, breaking community rules, etc.
<h4>How to Apply for Protection Under the CDC Eviction Moratorium</h4>
You can find the declaration form for the CDC Eviction Moratorium <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. It’s pretty short and should only take a few minutes to complete. If you need help completing the form, you can get it from a HUD-approved housing counselor. This may be your best bet if you’re confused with any of the form’s questions, as all of your answers must be truthful to avoid issues later on.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

You’ll be asked questions to see if you qualify for the moratorium. You will have to check at least one box in each column to qualify.

In short, if you received a stimulus check or are on government assistance and have lost income due to COVID-19, you should be good to go until at least June 30, 2021. Once again, you will be responsible for back rent and fees, so be sure to make a payment plan that you can stick to.","Are you worried about getting evicted from your home during the coronavirus pandemic?

And imagine building your credit in the process. Sounds like a dream? Keep reading to make it your reality.

What have you done when you needed quick cash in the past? Did you call up friends and family asking for help? If you didn’t out of fear of embarrassment, you probably looked for other types of loans. And if you’re like millions with bad credit who can’t get a “decent” loan, you probably turned to a payday loan.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Problem With Payday Loans</h4>
Can a payday loan temporarily fill your pockets so you can handle an emergency or pay a bill? Yes, but at what cost? The main problem with payday loans is that while they may be convenient, they can be downright predatory due to ridiculously high interest rates.

Now, imagine you need a few hundred dollars because your light bill is way past due and your electricity is about to get shut off, leaving your entire family in the dark. You apply for a payday loan and get it, which helps you pay that light bill. And while your electricity stays on and your family can function, guess what that loan comes with? Up to 400 percent interest rates, which will just put you in a giant hole later on to the point that you’ll wish you never got the loan in the first place.

So, if payday loans are so expensive that many consider them predatory, why are they so popular? You can blame it on bad credit, because if you have a low credit score, a payday loan may be your only option as other lenders won’t be willing to work with you.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

That may have been the case in the past, but thanks to an app like Possible Finance, you can now get quick cash through an installment loan with more reasonable interest rates.
<h4>The Benefits of an Installment Loan From Possible Finance</h4>
Let’s say you have bad credit, your car is out of warranty, it needs a costly repair, and you’re out of cash. Instead of opting for a payday loan with up to 400 percent interest, you can apply for an installment loan through Possible Finance.

What are the benefits of such a loan? First, you won’t have to worry about your bad credit holding you back, as there won’t be a credit check. Second, you can get up to $500, which is a nice chunk of change to handle emergencies. Third, you can pay the loan back over a more extended period. Payday loans often require payment with your next paycheck. 

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

A Possible Finance installment loan can be paid back over two months. Last but not least, when you pay back the installment loan over two months, you can build up your credit score. So, not only do you get the quick cash you need, you build your credit score too so you can enjoy a better financial future.

<h4>Change the Way You Look at Dinner</h4>
For some reason, society has taught us that dinner has to be formal and expensive every night of the week. That simply isn’t true, especially if you’re on a budget, which is why you should change how you look at dinner to start saving.

Here are some ways to achieve this goal:
<ul>
 	<li>Make breakfast for dinner, as your morning meals are usually a lot more economical.</li>
 	<li>Eat appetizers for dinner.</li>
 	<li>Aim for three-ingredient recipes that cost less and are easier to make.</li>
 	<li>Look for meatless meals that cut your per-dinner costs by eliminating pricy meats.</li>
 	<li>Use your leftovers to create new meals.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

When you start implementing those tips at dinner, you should see a significant increase in your bottom line. Not only will they save you money, but they’ll save you time and stress as well.
<h4>Plan Your Meals</h4>
It’s a lot easier to stick to a limited budget when you plan your meals. Doing so keeps you from straying from a list and making expensive impulse purchases. It also saves you from eating out because you don’t know what to make.

If meal planning seems too time-consuming, invest in a plan. What the plan costs upfront will be more than worth it with the time and money you save in the long run.
<h4>Clean Out Your Pantry</h4>
When we say, “Clean out your pantry,” we don’t mean you should toss things out and buy new ones. Instead, we’re suggesting you use whatever you have in your kitchen and don’t shop until it’s gone.

If you need tips on how to do this, look up the “pantry challenge” that works wonders at cleaning out your kitchen and saving money.
<h4>Never Enter the Store Without a List</h4>
As simple as it sounds, shopping with a list will save you tons of money as long as you stick to this rule: If it’s not on the list, don’t buy it.
<h4>Never Shop When You’re Hungry</h4>
Your impulse purchases will skyrocket if you shop when you’re starving, so eat something beforehand.
<h4>Compare Grocery Prices</h4>
If you want to see who has the lowest prices, use an app like Instacart to compare them.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Enroll in Loyalty Programs</h4>
Many large grocery store chains have loyalty programs with incentives to keep you coming back. Sign up for these programs to get instant savings at checkout.
<h4>Use This Simple Method to Save</h4>
An excellent strategy to use when grocery shopping is to:
<ol>
 	<li>Shop for your staples first (eggs, meat, veggies, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Shop for sales items next.</li>
</ol>
When shopping for sales items, only pick up things that mesh with your meal plan.
<h4>Avoid the Middle Aisles</h4>
Speaking of staples, you can find necessities and the healthiest foods on the perimeter of the store. What’s found in the middle aisles? Processed comfort foods that are pricey and not so ideal for your health.
<h4>If It’s at Eye Level, Skip It</h4>
Grocery stores tend to stock the most expensive items at eye level. Look up and down for better deals.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Pick Generic Over Brand Names</h4>
You may be skeptical of this tip due to quality. To give it a try, buy one generic item on your next trip and compare it to the brand name. Once you see there’s little difference, you can keep going generic to save money.
<h4>Go Frozen Over Fresh</h4>
Frozen foods like fruits and veggies last longer and tend to be cheaper.
<h4>Shop Without Your Kids</h4>
If you can get someone to take care of your kids while you shop, do it. Kids can fill your cart with unnecessary and expensive items.","You could cut coupons to save cash on food.

893,"How To Negotiate Cheaper Cell Phone, Cable, And Internet Bills","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

What do most people suggest you do to save money each month? Cut back on your fun. That means less dining out, not as much entertainment, and other fun-cutting moves that could make your life miserable.

Well, the good news is this: You can save money each month without being miserable in the process. How? By simply negotiating some of your existing bills to lower monthly amounts. Here are the tips that can get you to that goal as far as your cell phone, cable, and Internet bills are concerned.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Cell Phone</h4>
What’s something that rarely leaves your side? If you’re like most nowadays, it’s your cell phone, and with good reason.

Sure, you can use a cell phone to keep in touch with others, especially during emergencies. But cell phones do so much more that we can no longer live without them.

What can you live without? Expensive cell phone bills, which is why you should give these negotiating tactics a try:
<ul>
 	<li>Look at prepaid carriers – You can get rid of a binding contract and enjoy reliable service by taking the prepaid route. Out of all the cost-cutting tips, this may yield the best results since there’s so much competition in the cell phone arena.</li>
 	<li>Revise your protection plan – Paying for a pricey protection plan on a brand new iPhone is a good idea. Paying for one if you have an older phone may be a waste, which is why you may want to cut your coverage to lower your monthly bill.</li>
 	<li>Save $5 with autopay – Companies like T-Mobile will offer discounts for switching to autopay. In fact, you may save on each line in your plan, which can add up to some significant monthly savings.</li>
 	<li>Add lines to your plan – Are all of your family members on different plans? Consolidate by adding them to your plan, and you can make each line a lot more affordable.</li>
 	<li>Ensure your plan fits your needs – You may not need an excessive plan with the top offerings for talk, text, and data. Whether you don’t use much of those options or something else you’re paying for, call up your company to trim the fat.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Cable</h4>
With so many people cutting the cord, you have significant leverage over your cable company as long as you do the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Bundle – Combine your cable with phone and Internet, and you can save. And when you become a new bundler, that usually leads to even more savings for a certain period.</li>
 	<li>Complain – Call up your cable company and tell them you’re unhappy with the service. To keep you happy, they may offer a discount.</li>
 	<li>Check your channels – You may be paying for channels you never watch. Let your cable company know what you want to get rid of, and they may be able to lower your bill.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Internet</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Make a list of competitors – The more competitors in your area, the better your chances of negotiating a lower bill. Don’t cancel service if you have no other providers available, or you’ll be left out in the cold.</li>
 	<li>Call to cancel – Now that you know who the competitors are, you can call your Internet provider and say you want to cancel. They’ll probably put a retention specialist on the phone to keep you around with a deep discount and the possibility of even faster service.</li>
</ul>","Are you looking for ways to minimize your monthly expenses?

906,"Hitting The Road This Summer? Do This To Spend Less","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’re working with a limited travel budget, these money-saving tips should keep you from overspending.
<h4>Plan a Toll-Less Trip</h4>
If you haven’t taken a long road trip in a while, you may experience sticker shock when you see how much tolls are nowadays. To avoid that unnecessary expense, plan your trip wisely.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

Perhaps the easiest way to avoid tolls is to use a GPS. This can be a separate electronic device you bought at a store, or you can download an app on your smartphone like Google Maps or Waze. Each option should have a way to avoid tolls, so look in the settings, make that adjustment, and enjoy your toll-free trip.

What can you do if you don’t have a GPS or any of those apps on your smartphone? You can use a site like TollGuru.com to map out your route. As you can tell by the name, the site will tell you where to go so you can avoid tolls and keep more cash in your pocket for other travel expenses.
<h4>Pay Less for Gas</h4>
Have you seen the gas prices lately? They’ve skyrocketed so much that we haven't had such numbers since 2014. What’s the worst part about it all? That those prices don’t look like they’re going to be falling anytime soon, which is why this tip is a money-saving must.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

If you haven’t heard of GasBuddy, now’s the time to get acquainted with the app, as it will be your best buddy for saving money at the pump in more ways than one.

First, you can use GasBuddy to quickly find the nearest gas stations with the best prices on your phone. This can be of great help if you’re looking for the cheapest spot or if you find yourself almost empty and needing a fill-up before you get stranded.

Second, there’s a GasBuddy card that can lead to 25 cent savings per gallon. All you have to do is order the card, link it to your debit card, swipe at the pump, and save.

Want to extend your savings even more? Stack your GasBuddy card savings with a loyalty card from Circle K, Shell, or some other station.
<h4>Find Free Entertainment</h4>
Finding free ways to entertain yourself is incredibly easy nowadays, thanks to the Internet. Before you hit the road or while you’re on it, head to Eventbrite.com or Facebook.com/events to find affordable or even free things to do in whatever city you choose. To fill up your low-cost itinerary even more, look at the “Things to Do” section on Groupon.com to find the best discounts on local entertainment.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Cut Your Food Costs</h4>
The best way to save on food when traveling is to cook your own meals. That may not be an option, though, if you’re not staying at someone’s home that has a full kitchen, so head to LocalSaver.com or RetailMeNot.com to find dine-in and take-out deals wherever you go.","Many families are hitting the road this summer after spending over a year stuck inside.

Then keep reading, as we’ll help you pick that ideal work-from-home job to match your skill set.

Working from home has its advantages, as it can help you make your own schedule. You can also be your own boss, dress how you’d like, work from your couch, do whatever you want whenever you want, and so on. It can also be more motivating, as you work for yourself and have less of a limit on your income.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AdSense -->

What’s a big problem with working from home? Figuring out how to break into it if you have no experience. To do so, you have to figure out what you’re good at and what suits your skills, which is what we’ll do now.
<h4>If You Have a Special Skill…</h4>
There are two primary ways to turn any special skill into a work-at-home income. The first is to teach that skill to others via learning platforms like Skillshare.com, Udemy.com, and Teachable.com. Whether you’re a bookkeeping expert or you’re a great photographer, you can share your insight with others by making mini-courses that you can sell. And if you think nobody is interested in learning your “skills,” think again, as there are online courses made by people just like you that are earning solid incomes.

Beyond sharing your knowledge via online learning platforms, here’s another way to turn your particular skill into work-at-home income: By freelancing. Sites like Fiverr.com and Upwork.com are loaded with clients from all over the world who need people to translate, write, design, and more. Get one client and do a good job, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how quickly our income can grow.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>If You’re Crafty…</h4>
Are you creative? Do you love making items such as candles, potpourri, or mittens? Whatever it is, you can sell it through a site like Etsy.com. All you have to do is make something, take some high-quality pictures, post them, and wait for customers.

To make even more money, you can take custom orders where you can charge a pretty penny.
<h4>If You Like to Drive…</h4>
There are plenty of ways to turn your car into a money-making home office. You can take the traditional route and become a driver for Uber or Lyft, or you can work for DoorDash or Uber Eats, delivering food you pick up from restaurants. If you don’t mind grocery shopping, you can work for Instacart. And if you don’t want to work with food, you can work for a company like Postmates, where you pick up supplies. Lastly, you can take a more “official” route to delivery driving by working for Amazon Flex.

<h4>If You Like to Organize and Multitask…</h4>
There’s no shortage of busy people looking to hire others as virtual assistants. You can earn $9 to $15 per hour doing data entry, scheduling appointments, answering emails, taking phone calls, and more. And unlike traditional assistant jobs, you don’t even have to see your boss in person, which is a plus if you value your freedom and independence.","Want to start working from home and becoming more independent?

919,"How To Save $100 Per Month By Cutting Cable","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll show you how by getting rid of your cable and replacing it with much cheaper (or even free) options.

How much is your cable bill? If you’re like many, you’re paying anywhere from $100 to even $200 per month to entertain you and your family. Is that expense really necessary, though? The answer is no, especially when there are so many cheaper options nowadays that have cable companies nervous.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

While it could be said that cable is convenient, we’re about to show you several easy ways to replace it. And even though some have costs of their own, they should still save you money each month, as cable costs have gotten out of hand.
<h4>Tips to Replace Your Cable Subscription</h4>
<em>Call your company</em>

If you enjoy your cable lineup but don’t like how much you’re paying each month, a quick phone call could help you cut your costs.

Call your cable company and let them know you’re unhappy. If you had any instances when the cable went out or service issues, detail them to strengthen your argument. Then say you’re looking to cancel your subscription, as you feel you’re overpaying and want to see what the competition has to offer.

Stating all of the above should get the customer service rep to offer a discount to retain you. While the discount may not be forever, you could end up with a lower bill for a few months or enjoy some free perks, such as premium channels at no cost.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<em>Get tons of free channels from a cheap antenna</em>

If you’re ready to cut the cord and ditch your cable company for good, buying an HD antenna for about $15 should be your first move. After screwing it into the back of your TV, you should be able to receive channels like FOX, CBS, NBC, ABC, and PBS, plus even more local channels. Not only are they free, but they come in HD.

<em>Stream free services</em>

The HD antenna will provide the foundation to replace your cable lineup while keeping the essentials. Now, you can add to your entertainment via free services that act like Netflix, but have zero cost.

For example, Pluto TV, Tubi, Vudu, Crackle, and the Roku Channel are all free. And they all offer tons of movies and TV shows that can ensure there’s never a dull moment in your home.

You can stream those free services via your laptop, smartphone, or tablet. If you have a Smart TV, you can stream them from there as well, or you can make an old TV “smart-like” by installing a device like Roku, Amazon Fire Stick, or Apple TV.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<em>Add low-cost paid services</em>

If you’re okay with spending a bit each month for entertainment, try one premium service per month. For instance, one month, you can sign up for Netflix and see everything they have to offer.
Then you can switch to Hulu and Prime Video in the following months to enjoy tons of content while keeping your costs low.

If you want to replace your cable lineup altogether with a cheaper alternative, opt for something like Sling TV or Hulu with live TV. Both can give you lengthy lineups for about half the cost of cable.","Are you ready to have more spending money each month?

928,"Do This To Make Great Money With Your Car","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

Have you been looking for extra income in all the wrong places? If your car is one place where you haven’t looked, the answer is yes. We’re not talking about finding coins in between your seats’ cushions either, as your vehicle is a valuable weapon for making great wages in this current climate.

Here are various tips to make great money with your car. Best of all, they take very little time to implement, which is excellent news if you need copious cash fast.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>Sell It if You Don’t Need It</h4>
Have you looked at car prices lately? They’re booming since the inventory of new cars is stifled due to holdups in manufacturing parts.

With the inventory of new cars being so limited, used cars are now getting plenty of love. But since used cars have a limited supply, their prices have skyrocketed.

This makes it a bad time to buy a car. But if you can sell yours, you’ll be looking at some mighty nice numbers from dealers or private buyers.

Did you know that dealers are offering twice the amount for trade-ins as usual? They sure are, and private buyers are forking over 30 percent more cash than usual for used vehicles as well.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

While snatching a higher price for your car is good news, even better news is that it’s so easy to sell at the moment. You can contact Carvana, CarMax, or local dealers to see how much they’ll offer by giving them the details of your car. Or, if you want to sell yourself and have a bit more patience, you can list your car on sites like the Facebook Marketplace, CarGurus.com, or AutoTrader.com.
<h4>Start Doing Deliveries</h4>
People are delivering a lot more than pizza now, so if that’s been holding you back from using your car to make money, know that you have many options.

You can deliver food through sites like Uber Eats, Instacart, or DoorDash. You can deliver packages through Amazon Flex for up to $19 per hour. And, of course, you can deliver people to their destinations via services like Uber and Lyft.

If you want to take a more entrepreneurial approach, make a list of the car-related tasks you’d like to offer. Then go to TaskRabbit.com and make a profile listing your services. Doing so can give you more control over your schedule and income, and it could lead to long-term work from satisfied customers.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Advertise on Your Car</h4>
Did you know that you can make up to $450 a month for driving as you usually do, but with advertisements on your car? Thanks to sites like Wrapify.com and Carvertise.com, you can.

Head to those sites to sign up, and you could use that cash to pay off your car quickly.

Convert Your Car Into a Rental

Imagine how much extra income you could bring in by renting your car to someone else for as much as $100 per day. That’s what people are doing, thanks to sites like Turo.com and Getaround.com, and you can do the same.","Your car could be a gold mine if you follow these tips to earn extra cash with it.","2021-10-01 04:01:27",post,https://section8assist.com/do-this-to-make-great-money-with-your-car/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_277865294.png,shutterstock_277865294.png,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_277865294.png,929,shutterstock_277865294,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_277865294.png,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,do-this-to-make-great-money-with-your-car,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:29:08"
931,"Drowning In Medical Bills? Do This","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

If so, here are some tips that can help you fix your finances before they get any worse.

It’s impossible to prevent medical emergencies such as car accidents, slip and falls, and other injuries. When they happen, all you can think about is your health and how you’ll recover. But as you recover, something unhealthy happens: You get hit with medical bills for going to the hospital or the doctor. And when you see how high those bills are, it’s enough to make you even sicker than you were before.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

How do some people pay for costly medical bills? They either do it via a hefty emergency fund or some other savings. But if you don’t have such savings, you’ll need assistance.

Here’s where to get it from a variety of sources that can help pay your medical bills or at least make them more manageable so you can relieve some of that sticker shock:
<h4>Contact the Healthcare Provider</h4>
Before you jump into any of the other ways to get help with paying medical bills, it’s best to contact the healthcare provider that’s billing you in the first place. So, if you had to go to the hospital, give them a call. Or, if a doctor is the one billing you, contact them ASAP.

When calling, let them know your situation. Tell them you cannot pay such a high bill, and it has you worried. They may ask some specifics, so be prepared to discuss your work situation or income.

When doing this, some healthcare providers have the power to drop the bill altogether. Others can reduce it to make the bill a lot less expensive, while others can put you on a payment plan that’s easy to handle and matches your budget. Whatever you do, don’t ignore the bills, as they won’t disappear on their own. The more proactive you are, the better.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>Use GoFundMe</h4>
If you have no success negotiating lower bills through the healthcare provider, creating a GoFundMe may help. It can give your friends and family a way to donate to your cause, but even better, it can get the public involved.

Although you may be hesitant to create a fundraiser on GoFundMe, know that it can get you the cash you need quickly to pay off your medical debt. Thanks to the power of the Internet, this method has helped many people in a pinch.
<h4>Contact Your Local Religious Organization</h4>
A religious organization like a church can put the word out and create a fundraiser of its own. Your church or similar organization can help pay your medical bills relatively quickly by notifying such a tight-knit community.
<h4>Solicit the Help of a Medical Billing Advocate</h4>
If you want an expert to represent you, a medical billing advocate can help. They know all about medical bills, which helps them pinpoint expensive errors or negotiate lower costs. As you can imagine, these advocates charge for their service, but you may be able to get one for free through your workplace or by contacting the Patient Advocate Foundation.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Find a Disease-Specific Organization</h4>
Some organizations help pay medical bills for specific illnesses. You can search for such organizations related to your illness online. As a starting point, some examples are the HealthWell Foundation, the Patient Access Network Foundation, the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, and the CancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation.","Are you one of the 72 million people in the U.S. who’s drowning in medical debt?","2021-10-01 04:09:22",post,https://section8assist.com/drowning-in-medical-bills-do-this/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1521141509.png,shutterstock_1521141509.png,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1521141509.png,932,shutterstock_1521141509,,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_1521141509.png,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,drowning-in-medical-bills-do-this,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:27:25"
941,"Have A Felony? Try These Tips To Get Section 8","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

Imagine only having to pay 30 percent of your income towards rent. With the government shelling out the rest to your landlord, you’d be in a great position to get back on your feet. You wouldn’t have to worry so much about overpaying for housing. Best of all, you could concentrate on building your future so you can put that felony behind you.

What allows you to pay so little for rent? A Housing Choice Voucher from the government’s Section 8 program. They initiated it to help low-income people get affordable housing, and you could receive such benefits even if you have a felony. To increase your chances of becoming a Section 8 recipient, follow these tips:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>1. Know which felonies stand out.</h4>
In the eyes of the Section 8 program and your local Public Housing Agency (PHA), all felonies are not created equal. Some can set off a red flag that makes it tough to get approved for housing assistance, with methamphetamine trafficking and sex offenses being the worst of the bunch.

Some say that those two offenses make it impossible to get Section 8 for life. If either applies to you, contact your PHA to make sure. It never hurts to ask, and they could point you in the direction of other housing assistance if Section 8 is not an option.

Other felonies that could set off red flags include ones for violent crimes, fraud, and drug trafficking. Even though the following aren’t felonies, a pattern of domestic disturbances, drug or alcohol abuse, and late rent payment history could hurt your chances of securing a voucher as well.

Besides the type of felony, the timeframe may also be considered. The more time has passed, the less damaging your felony will be when applying for Section 8.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>2. Know there will be background checks.</h4>
Getting housing on your own is possible without any background checks that could bring up felonies. When applying for Section 8 assistance, however, background checks are part of the game.

Be prepared for background checks from your PHA and any prospective landlords. As such, don’t try to hide your past. If asked about it, stress the positive and how much you’ve changed from the experience.
<h4>3. Know the paperwork.</h4>
If it seems like your felony won’t prevent you from applying for a voucher, here are some types of documents you’ll need to produce:
<ul>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Bank statements</li>
 	<li>Pay stubs</li>
 	<li>Proof of citizenship</li>
 	<li>Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Proof of residence</li>
 	<li>Tax forms</li>
</ul>
You will need documents for each person in the household.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>4. Know about preferences.</h4>
Section 8 housing has a very high demand. In some locations, people wait several years to receive vouchers. Keeping this in mind, you should see if you have any preferences that can help you move past the line quickly, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Status as a local resident.</li>
 	<li>Homelessness.</li>
 	<li>Paying over 50 percent of income towards rent.</li>
 	<li>Living in substandard housing.</li>
 	<li>Being a domestic violence victim.</li>
 	<li>Facing eviction when it’s not your fault.</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Know where to apply.</h4>
<a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Get to know your PHA now</a>. They will help you apply for Section 8 and decide whether or not you become a beneficiary of the low-income housing assistance program.

Ask your PHA about wait times. Tell them your situation and any felonies in your past. The more they know and the more you ask, the smoother the process will be.","Getting a Section 8 voucher might be the best way to secure affordable housing as a felon.

945,"Section 8 Inspection FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

While they may sound scary, home inspections are pretty straightforward, and we’ll fill you in on what they entail.
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions on Section 8 Inspections</h3>
<h4>How often are inspections performed?</h4>
The first Section 8 inspection will happen after you pick a property, such as an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. Before you can move in, an inspector will check to see that the property meets the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. Once it’s deemed safe, you can move into the property.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

After that, you can expect Section 8 inspections every year, although they could happen on an as-needed basis. If there are health or safety issues, you or your landlord could request an inspection from the Public Housing Agency (PHA).
<h4>What do inspectors look for?</h4>
Section 8 inspectors check to see that the property meets the following performance requirements set by the HUD:
<ul>
 	<li>Water supply</li>
 	<li>Thermal environment</li>
 	<li>Structure and materials</li>
 	<li>Space and security</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Site and neighborhood</li>
 	<li>Sanitary facilities</li>
 	<li>Sanitary conditions</li>
 	<li>Lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Interior air quality</li>
 	<li>Illumination and electricity</li>
 	<li>Food preparation and refuse disposal</li>
 	<li>Access</li>
</ul>
They want to see that the house is safe, decent, and sanitary, which is what the criteria above helps them figure out.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>What happens if you fail an inspection?</h4>
Believe it or not, you can fail a Section 8 property inspection if just one issue is found. You’ll be given time to fix the issue, after which the inspector will come back. If the problem is fixed, you’ll be fine. If not, the landlord will have to let you move if it’s their fault. And if it’s your fault, you may lose your voucher.
<h4>Are there any red flags inspectors look for?</h4>
Some specific issues that could put you on the fast path towards a failed inspection include:
<ul>
 	<li>Broken doors, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, or windows.</li>
 	<li>Dirty or unusable appliances.</li>
 	<li>Garbage hoarding.</li>
 	<li>Holes or stains in ceilings.</li>
 	<li>Walls littered with holes, grease, graffiti, or mold.</li>
 	<li>Tears, stains, punctures, holes, or burns in floors.</li>
 	<li>Flea infestation from pets.</li>
 	<li>Utilities that are turned off for non-payment.</li>
 	<li>Uncut grass, high weeds, and other examples of neglected landscaping.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is there anything you can do to prepare for a Section 8 inspection?</h4>
Since failing an inspection could lead you to lose your voucher that you may have waited years to receive, it’s crucial to prepare. If not, you could find yourself scrambling to finish repairs at the last minute.

The two biggest things you can do to prepare for a Section 8 home inspection are:
<ol>
 	<li>Ask your landlord to make the necessary repairs.</li>
 	<li>Maintain your home throughout your lease, so problems don’t pile up.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

Your lease agreement should outline what your landlord is responsible for. Let them know what needs to be fixed before the inspection comes. And if it’s a problem you caused, take care of it before the inspector arrives.

If your landlord refuses, you can contact your PHA and request an inspection to show that there is, in fact, a problem. If they don’t fix it, you may be allowed to move elsewhere.

Again, maintaining the property throughout your lease is your best bet to passing inspection every time. And it will also give you the added benefit of putting a safe, clean roof over your loved ones’ heads.","You’ll be dealing with inspections as you receive Section 8 assistance.

948,"6 Ways To Accelerate Section 8 Wait Times","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

The Section 8 program offers immense benefits to those who qualify. By paying most of your rent with a voucher, you can enjoy affordable housing and all of the perks that come with it. But there is one downside to Section 8, and that’s the waiting list.

While your goal is to get on the Section 8 waiting list, it can take over a year to reach your turn. You can combat this long wait time by applying to multiple waiting lists. You could also use the following circumstances to your advantage, as Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) give them priority over other applicants:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>1. Homelessness</h4>
PHAs tend to move homeless people towards the front of Section 8 waiting lists due to their dire situations. You’ll need to check with your PHA to see how they define homelessness. If you live with friends and family, for instance, you may not be considered homeless.
<h4>2. Living in a Shelter</h4>
The Section 8 program's central goal is to get families off of the streets or shelters and into their own homes. If you’re living in a shelter or some other form of emergency housing, don’t forget to tell your PHA. It could get you moved towards the front of the waitlist.
<h4>3. Having Extremely Low Income</h4>
Section 8 was created with low-income families in mind. To qualify for the program, you’ll need to make below a certain income. PHAs often have three tiers of income where they place applicants:
<ul>
 	<li>Low – The household makes 80% of the median income for the area.</li>
 	<li>Very low – The household makes 50% of the median income for the area.</li>
 	<li>Extremely low - The household makes 30% of the median income for the area.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

Falling into that third income category can give you priority over others. In fact, over ¾ of Section 8 applicants that get approved for vouchers earn extremely low incomes. Be sure to tell your PHA if you fall in this group.
<h4>4. Age 62 or Older</h4>
Beyond helping low-income families gain access to safe, affordable housing, Section 8 also aims to help elderly citizens. By definition, “elderly” is 62 or older.
<h4>5. Having a Disability</h4>
Does anyone in your household have a disability? This could accelerate your Section 8 wait time, too, especially if your current housing isn’t sufficient.

For instance, if a family member has asthma and you live in a place with low air quality, that could help you get your voucher quicker. You’ll need to show medical documentation to prove this, but the extra work is worth it.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>6. Being a Veteran</h4>
If someone in your household served in the military and was honorably discharged, their status as a veteran could help you receive your voucher faster.

Can you use more than one of these circumstances to move up the Section 8 waitlist? Of course, you can. The more that apply, the better since Section 8 uses a point system when determining priorities.","A Section 8 voucher can give you access to housing that’s clean, safe, and affordable. Here are some ways to get your voucher quicker.","2021-10-27 17:35:09",post,https://section8assist.com/6-ways-to-accelerate-section-8-wait-times/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1468899689.jpg,shutterstock_1468899689.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1468899689.jpg,949,"Average,Family,House,With,Green,Lawn,On,Cloudy,Day,In",,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1468899689.jpg,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,6-ways-to-accelerate-section-8-wait-times,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-27 17:35:09"
951,"Hotel Vouchers For The Homeless FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

<h3>What Is a Homeless Hotel Voucher?</h3>
A homeless voucher allows you to stay in a hotel or motel, even if you don’t have the money to pay for it. This is not a form of long-term housing assistance, as your stay will usually be limited to one to three nights.

Referral agencies often have agreements with certain hotels and motels that allow them to provide this service to the homeless. In some instances, you can choose your lodging.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h3>Why Would You Use a Motel Voucher Instead of a Homeless Shelter?</h3>
There are many reasons why someone would prefer a voucher over a homeless shelter. While shelters can provide housing to those who need it, they’re known to come with specific issues that may not be ideal, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Problems with alcohol and drug abuse</li>
 	<li>Theft</li>
 	<li>Residents who could be a danger to themselves or others</li>
 	<li>Lack of sanitation or infestation of insects and rodents</li>
</ul>
Depending on the location, some shelters may be overcrowded and have no room for new residents. Some people may also be banned from using shelters, which forces them to find other forms of housing.

Lastly, the thought of moving into a homeless shelter can be very intimidating for someone who has never lived on the streets. With a hotel voucher, you can get the temporary housing you need and buy some time to get organized before having to choose a shelter as your last resort.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h3>Where Can You Find Homeless Motel Vouchers?</h3>
Finding a homeless hotel voucher may be a bit of a challenge, depending on where you live.
To begin your search, try the following options that tend to be the most popular:
<h4>Call 211</h4>
Dialing 211 can instantly connect you with a local operator who can provide help with housing. The operator won’t be able to give you a voucher themselves, but they will know who to contact in your area so you can kick start the process.

Calling 211 is your best bet since they not only provide housing assistance, but can also help you find food, healthcare, bill-paying assistance, and more so you can get back on your feet without having to do a ton of research.
<h4>Salvation Army</h4>
The Salvation Army is no stranger to helping the homeless, as they’ve provided food and housing to those in need for many years. You can contact your local Salvation Army and ask if they offer homeless hotel vouchers. If not, they may be able to connect you with a homeless shelter for the time being.
<h4>Homeless Shelters</h4>
Even though staying in a homeless shelter may be the last thing you want to do, contacting one could help you secure a motel voucher. Since shelters exist to help the homeless, their staff members are likely experts at vouchers and other forms of assistance that could make a world of difference right now.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Catholic Charities</h4>
Like the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities have played a significant role in helping the homeless over the years. Contact the branch nearest you and ask if they offer hotel vouchers for the homeless.
<h4>Regional Assistance Programs</h4>
Many states, counties, and cities have their own programs to help the homeless. The one nearest you may have motel vouchers available. Be sure to ask the 211 operator if they know of any regional assistance programs for the homeless. You can also do an online search for homeless assistance in your state, county, or city to see if you get any leads.","If you’re homeless, a hotel or motel voucher could put a roof over your head temporarily until you get your finances in order.

954,"Are You Being Ripped Off On Your Monthly Bills?","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

You may be doing your best to lower your consumption of services to reduce your monthly bills. But as they come in, you may be surprised that they keep going up.

What could be the cause of increased monthly costs? Billing errors by companies that can drain your finances if you don’t spot them quick enough. Here are some of the most common monthly culprits:

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>Phone Bills</h4>
You told your kids to stop streaming videos and to watch their data usage. And you’ve also avoided going over your monthly minute limit to keep your phone bill as low as possible. But once it arrived in the mail, you noticed the overall bill went up. What caused that increase? If everything else stayed the same, it could be external companies “cramming” charges on your account.

Outside companies can sometimes charge you via your phone bill for things like ringtones or other services. These crammed charges could be masked as “Subscription” or “Member Fee” on your phone, so you don’t notice them.

If you see any such charges, call your phone company and tell them to remove them. Block the company as well so they cannot bill you in the future.

Besides crammed charges, your phone bill could also be higher than it should be due to discounts not being applied. If you signed up for phone service and some type of discount was the incentive, make sure you're getting it.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>TV Bills</h4>
Did you cut the fat on your TV bill by streaming unnecessary channels, only to find that the monthly bill has hardly changed? If so, you could still be getting billed for channels or services you canceled or do not receive.

Check your bill versus your cable lineup to make sure you’re not getting stiffed. And pay close attention to equipment fees, as they’re sometimes charged even though you don’t have those devices in your home.
<h4>Medical Bills</h4>
Errors on medical bills are common and can be pretty costly. Coding errors could overcharge you by billing you for the wrong service. You can double-check this by calling your insurer and asking for clarification on the codes if a charge looks suspicious.

Another error that results in overcharging is when doctors or hospitals charge you before invoicing your insurer. You can avoid this costly mistake by confirming that the insurer was billed first before paying.

<h4>Utility Bills</h4>
Water, gas, or electric meters can have mechanical issues that lead to incorrect readings and overpriced bills. If you feel like you’re the victim of incorrect readings, call the company so they can check the meter.

Also, look at all of the charges that make up your utility bills. You may have been overpaying from the start because the person who set up your bill did so incorrectly. For instance, you may be charged a business tax when you’re a residential customer, which could lead to a refund if you notify the company of their error.","It can be hard to maintain a budget when companies are overcharging you on monthly bills.

We’ll reveal them, as well as some tips to make Netflix less costly so you can enjoy that too.

When it comes to streaming services, Netflix gets most of the publicity. Does that mean it’s worth your hard-earned money? Not necessarily, especially since there’s so much competition out there, and much of it is free.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

Sure, you could opt for premium Netflix competitors like Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, and so on, but if you’re on a budget, you want something more affordable.
And there’s nothing more affordable than free.

With that said, let’s look at some free streaming services you can use to watch TV shows and movies. Then, we’ll show you some ways to cut the monthly subscription costs of Netflix so you can splurge on that too, or get it completely free.
<h4>1. Pluto TV</h4>
You’ll never get bored with Pluto TV, as this free service has TV shows and movies spread across 250 channels.

You can choose to either watch live TV on Pluto, or check out their on-demand selection. As long as you can put up with the ads, you’ll probably make Pluto part of your daily watching routine.
<h4>2. Tubi</h4>
You won’t find new releases on Tubi, but you will find a massive catalog of movies (some of which are hard to find), TV shows, and more to keep your eyes occupied.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>3. Vudu</h4>
You can choose from thousands of free titles on Vudu across various genres. Unlike some other free streaming services, its commercials tend to be a lot shorter.
<h4>4. Crackle</h4>
Just as Netflix has its own original content, so does Crackle. In addition to such content, you’ll also find well-known TV shows and movies.
<h4>5. FilmRise</h4>
Are you a fan of older content? FilmRise has plenty of it within its catalog of 20,000-plus TV shows and movies. Music fans will love the fact that you can enjoy live concerts too.
<h4>6. Xumo</h4>
Like Pluto TV, Xumo has a setup where you can view live channels. It has TV shows, movies on demand, sports, news, and more for the entire family. And like the other options in this list, it all comes at no cost.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Free Netflix Tips</h4>
While that list of free streaming services can keep you busy, you may still have a desire to become a Netflix subscriber. Here are some tips to get it for free or at a reduced price:
<ul>
 	<li>Share a password – Friends or family members can share their existing login info so you can watch at no cost, or at least split the cost to pay very little for this perk.</li>
 	<li>Get free DVDs – Free streaming trials no longer exist for Netflix. Free DVD rentals do, though, so get one for 30 days to enjoy a massive catalog of TV shows and new movie releases.</li>
 	<li>Get free Netflix from your phone or Internet company – Some companies like T-Mobile offer free Netflix for their customers.</li>
 	<li>Apply a promo code – Search online for Netflix promo codes that will cut your monthly subscription cost.</li>

960,"How To Enjoy Free TVs And Movies","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll show you how via some tips you can implement today.

One of the easiest ways to make more room in your budget is to eliminate some of your entertainment expenses. This starts by eating out less often, cutting those bar visits (if you drink), trying staycations instead of costly road trips, and not going to the movies as much.

What about cable, though? It’s a monthly expense that can be pretty high, depending on your provider. And with so many other options like we’re about to show you, why keep cable unless you’re watching all the channels?

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

Here’s how easy it is to cut the cord, get rid of those high cable costs, and enjoy more TV and movies than you ever have before.
<h3>Start by Buying a Cheap HD Antenna</h3>
Did you know that you can watch all of your local channels plus CBS, ABC, Fox, PBS, NBC, and so on without paying a thing? Even better, did you know that you can watch those channels, and many more, with crystal-clear HD quality?

You certainly can, and the secret is to install a cheap HD antenna to the back of your TV. With it, you’ll get loads of channels in your area without any monthly fees. Just get the antenna for around $15 bucks, and you’ll be good to go well into the future.
<h3>Stream These Free Services</h3>
You can replace cable with services like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, and more. The problem is, each of those has its own monthly cost, so if you have multiple services, you could end up with a bill similar to what you pay for cable.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

We’ll show you how to get free Netflix and Hulu in a second. Here are some services that are entirely free yet still feature a ton of TV shows and movies:
<h4>The Roku Channel</h4>
You don’t need a Roku device to watch what this free streaming service has to offer. If you have a laptop, you’ll be golden.
<h4>Crackle</h4>
If you want to see some original content you won’t find anywhere else, Crackle may suffice. It has loads of free TV shows and movies that you’ll recognize too.
<h4>Vudu</h4>
You’ll find free movies and TV shows galore here.
<h4>Tubi</h4>
It may look like Netflix with its catalog of free TV programs and movies, but it’s free.
<h4>Pluto TV</h4>
With over 250 unique channels at no cost, you may never miss cable again.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Try Premium Streaming Services for Free</h4>
You can get a free month of DVD rentals shipped to your door with Netflix. Unfortunately, they eliminated their free streaming trial.

Meanwhile, Hulu has a one-month free trial that’ll help you see what they have to offer without paying a thing.","Would you like to enjoy free TV and movies to not only keep your family entertained, but also to allow for some breathing room in your budget?

963,"If You Can’t Pay Your Rent, Apply To This Program","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

Thanks to this new rental assistance program, you can make that worry disappear.

If the pandemic made it impossible to pay your rent, you probably became quite familiar with the eviction moratorium. Now that it’s out of the picture, it’s time to familiarize yourself with something else: The Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program. Here are all the details you need to know before getting started.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>How to Find Your Local ERA Program</h4>
The U.S. Department of Treasury has billions of dollars allocated for emergency rental assistance. You won’t be contacting them to get help, though, as that money is split between 495 state and local programs.

Such a division of funding has kept many people from getting rental assistance. You don’t have to be one of them, though, as you can get direct assistance by finding your local program <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">through this link</a>.

With 495 programs accessible through that link, you should be able to find the office you’re looking for. If you can’t, though, dial 211 on your phone. When an operator picks up, tell them you’re having trouble finding the emergency rental assistance program nearest you.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

<h4>Emergency Rental Assistance Requirements</h4>
Although the pandemic probably affected us all in one way or another, there is simply not enough funding to help every renter in the U.S. As such, you will need to meet eligibility requirements to get rental assistance.

As you can imagine, these requirements can differ between local programs. So you know what to expect, here are the basic requirements of the ERA program:
<ul>
 	<li>Meeting local income requirements (making below a certain level of income for where you live).</li>
 	<li>Housing instability (being under the threat of eviction, having rent or utility bills that are past due)</li>
 	<li>Rental agreement (having something that says how much rent you owe and where).</li>
</ul>
If you feel like those requirements describe your situation, you may qualify for the ERA program.
Regardless, contact your local program to get a definitive answer.
<h4>Benefits of the ERA Program</h4>
You may feel overwhelmed at the amount of past-due bills you have related to housing. Provided your local program has enough funding, you could get some much-needed peace of mind, as here is what ERA intends to pay:
<ul>
 	<li>Overdue rent from as far back as March 13, 2020.</li>
 	<li>Future rent.</li>
 	<li>Past due bills from as far back as March 13, 2020.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

As you can see, the ERA program can clean up your past finances dating to March of last year, as that’s when a national state of emergency was declared. So, if you had issues paying rent, utilities, Internet, etc., qualifying for emergency rental assistance can fix them all.

What about moving expenses? If the pandemic caused you to move, you could get reimbursed for any costs you incurred due to relocating. This includes application/screening fees, security deposits, late fees, and even hotel/motel bills.

Are you guaranteed to get total funding for all of these expenses? Once again, it all depends on your local program, so <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact them now</a> to find out how much assistance is available.","With the protection that the eviction moratorium provided now gone, you may be worried about how you’ll pay the rent.

967,"4 Eligibility Requirements For Emergency Rental Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""20""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll reveal what they are and what it takes to prove you’re eligible.

If you had trouble paying the rent since the pandemic hit, at least you know there was help in the form of the eviction moratorium, occasional stimulus checks, and expanded unemployment benefits. What about now, though? You may still be struggling to find work and earn income, yet those forms of assistance are virtually gone.

[the_ad id='342']<!-- AD02 -->

Luckily, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program has stepped in to help families with financial needs pay the rent. But it hasn’t been perfect, as many don’t know the ERA program exists. Worst of all, the billions of dollars in funding for the program are split amongst nearly 500 local offices, so there’s a ton of confusion about eligibility and how to apply.

Hopefully, the following will clear up any confusion, as we’ll discuss the main eligibility requirements for emergency rental assistance and how you can start applying.
<h3>ERA Eligibility Requirements</h3>
Although there are billions of dollars backing the ERA program, that’s not enough money to pay everyone’s rent. The program is meant to take care of families with the most financial need, which is determined via the following eligibility requirements.
<h4>1. You cannot make more than a certain income.</h4>
It makes sense that if your income is high, you probably have little trouble paying the rent. Who determines what is “too high”? Your local program will, which you can contact by <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going to this page</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""21""]<!-- AD03 -->

As expected, you will have to show proof of your income. The easiest ways to do so are with past tax returns or pay stubs, but if you don’t have them, unemployment documents may suffice. Can your employer write a letter documenting your income? That could be enough evidence, and if you lack all of the above, your local program may let you provide a written statement.

Since the content of a written statement could be tough to prove, this option may be limited to people with special situations, such as anyone who lacks access to technology, is disabled, cannot contact their employer since the business closed, etc.
<h4>2. You must have a rental agreement.</h4>
By saying you must have a “rental agreement,” we mean that you need to show proof that you pay the rent to a landlord or management company. So, if you don’t have a signed lease, you’ll need to show something like check stubs, bank statements, utility bills, etc. A statement from your landlord detailing the home’s address and the rent payment may work too.
<h4>3. You must be experiencing financial hardship.</h4>
If one person in your household has experienced financial hardship from the pandemic, you should be good to go in this department. Owing large expenses, losing income, or relying on unemployment benefits are all examples of hardship.

[the_ad id='350']<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>4. You must be experiencing housing instability.</h4>
Does one of the following apply to your situation?
<ul>
 	<li>You live in unsafe or unhealthy conditions.</li>
 	<li>You’re being threatened with eviction.</li>
 	<li>Your rent is past due.</li>
 	<li>Your utilities are past due.</li>
</ul>
If the answer is yes and you can prove it, you can check off the housing instability requirement.

Now that you see how emergency rental assistance eligibility works, contact your local program to get the ball rolling before those benefits dry up.","Is being behind on your rent all you need to get emergency rental assistance? The answer is no, as there are four eligibility requirements you must meet.","2021-10-27 20:32:59",post,https://section8assist.com/4-eligibility-requirements-for-emergency-rental-assistance/,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_2010687902.jpg,shutterstock_2010687902.jpg,/chroot/home/a9120d4f/section8assist.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_2010687902.jpg,968,"Rental,Assistance,Program,Info,On,The,Screen.",,,,https://section8assist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_2010687902.jpg,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,1,Section8WP,cj@sedulen.com,,,4-eligibility-requirements-for-emergency-rental-assistance,,default,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-27 20:32:59"
