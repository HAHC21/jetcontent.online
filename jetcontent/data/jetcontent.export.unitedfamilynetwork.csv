3145,"These Government Subsidized Homes are Nicer Than Some High-Priced Rentals","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Paying taxes in the United States provides access to a variety of government programs designed to help low-income families with housing. This guide provides information required to better understand subsidized housing solutions.

<h3>Who is in charge of government housing</h3>

Federal housing programs were created by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with the purpose of providing qualified low-income households with financial assistance, and are administered by individual agencies at the federal, state and local level. In this guide, we offer an overview on all of these programs, as well as information on their unique benefits, conditions required to be eligible, how to apply, and more.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher</h3>

The Section 8’s Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) is the largest housing program of the federal government. The program provides assistance to very low-income families, senior citizens and disabled people so that they can afford decent and safe housing in the private market.

Under this program, qualified applicants are granted a housing voucher and allowed to search for housing among properties that meet the program’s requirements, not limited to those located within subsidized projects. Housing can include single-family homes, townhouses and apartments.

Public Housing Agencies (PHA) are in charge of administering the program locally on behalf of HUD. Landlords are paid the housing subsidy directly by the agencies, while participating families are only required to pay the difference between the subsidy and the actual rent. Eligibility to this program is determined by the local PHA based on the total annual gross income and size of the family.

Annual gross income may not exceed 50% of the median income of the area in which the household wants to live. Only US citizens and specified branches of non-citizens with eligible immigration status can apply for this program. If you are interested in applying for a Housing Choice Voucher, you can contact the local PHA.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Public Housin</h3>

Public housing programs in the United States provide apartment and homes for rent at affordable prices all across the country. Most of the rental arrangements for these properties are managed by the Public Housing Agencies (PHA), commonly known as the housing authorities, and which are funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). More than 3,300 housing authorities exist nationwide.

A program called the Total Tenant Payment (TTP) allows low-income participants to choose one out of three different methods to handle their monthly rent payments. They can pay 10% of their monthly income, 30% of their monthly adjusted income or a minimum rent of between 0$ and 50$ determined by their local PHA. However, they are mandated to live within the specific community they applied to be a part of, as well as to participate in community service.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Low Income Tax Credit</h3>

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a special dollar-for-dollar tax credit available to for investments in affordable housing. Since its introduction under the broader Tax Reform Act of 1986, the LIHTC has been used to incentivise home builders to consider low-income tenants. 

The program currently accounts for the vast majority of affordable rental housing available across the country today. What makes the LIHTC unique is that it’s offered to property owners instead of the tenants. The amount of subsidy will fluctuate based on the income of the families renting these units.

<h3>Project based section 8 rental assistance</h3>

The Project Based Section 8 Rental Assistance program is designed to provide low-income families with rental housing at affordable prices within privately-owned and managed rental properties. However, unlike the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), the subsidy is given to the properties instead, which means that families only enjoy the benefits of the program as long as they stay in these properties.

Most properties have a monthly rent equal to 30% of the family’s adjusted gross income, though through the Total Tenant Payment (TTP), they can instead request 10% of the monthly income or a minimum rent of 25$. 

Low-income families that wish to participate in the program have to apply to the individual property they desire to rent, oftentimes through a waiting list that can be several months long. To qualify, the family must fall within the required income limit that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has set for the program.

<h3>Housing for Victims of Natural Disaster</h3>

Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires are common across the United States. Many families have been left homeless after a natural disaster, and so the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has set up an agency called the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to address these crises and offer solutions to the victims.

Families affected by natural disasters can receive support through the Disaster Assistance Improvement Program (DAIP). This initiative was established in 2006 and provides survivors with a wide array of services including monetary assistance to repair their houses or rent a home. Interested parties can visit DisasterAssistance.gov or call 1 (800) 621-3362 for more information.

<h3>Housing for Immigrants</h3>

Many of the housing programs established by the federal government allow immigrants to take advantage of their benefits as long as several conditions are met. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allows mixed families composed of U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants to apply for the subsidies provided by their Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and Project-Based Section 8 programs.

The Department of Agriculture (USDA), which funds low-income apartment communities in rural areas of the country, also allows immigrants to take advantage of the benefits of their programs. Though USDA initiatives require the head of the family to be either a citizen or a legal resident. Some programs use a prorated system to determine how much will be subsidized according to the number of eligible immigrants in the household.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Section 811 Housing for the Disabled</h3>

The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities allows disabled people to enjoy good living standards by offering subsidized rental housing opportunities coupled with access to the supportive services they need to stay comfortable and healthy. 

The program works in several ways. It provides interest-free capital advances, subsidizes developers who build non-profit affordable housing communities and offers project rental assistance to state housing agencies across the country.

To be eligible, interested parties must have a physical disability, developmental disability or chronic mental illness. Families that apply to the program must have at least one family member with a disability. 

In both cases, the household must have an income within 50% of the median income of the area to apply for homes funded through capital advances and supported by project rental assistance contracts (PRAC), or within 30% of the median income of the area to apply for homes funded with Project Rental Assistance. Those interested in the program must submit an application in response to a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).","The Government is a really good tenant, that’s why homeowners are offering  their beautiful homes for participants in this housing assistance program.","2019-06-10 20:17:40",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/these-government-subsidized-homes-are-nicer-than-some-high-priced-rentals/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HousingRenters_img01.jpg,HousingRenters_img01.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HousingRenters_img01.jpg,2931,HousingRenters_img01,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HousingRenters_img01.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,these-government-subsidized-homes-are-nicer-than-some-high-priced-rentals,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:21:43"

Who is this article for? If your spending most of your money paying bills this applies to you. If bills are eating up more than half your income, statistically this means you are unable to save money and might be impacted hard by an emergency.

Don’t worry, you are not alone. Increasingly, people are living paycheck to paycheck. The good news is that this sort of deficit can be temporary for the ones who find help at the right time.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

The government runs several bill relief programs that can help low income families deal with mounting bill payments. These bill relief programs can help pay for phone bills, medical bills and other everyday expenses some families would be unable to pay on their own.
<h3>Help Paying Phone Bill with Lifeline</h3>
Lifeline is a phone bill assistance program operated by the federal government. It was established in 1985 and is currently administered by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC.

This program was designed to help low income households gain access to affordable phones and phone service. Eligible families can participate in the program by creating an account with an approved provider, which often also awards free cell phones to families who need it most.

To qualify for Lifeline, households must meet the requirements set by the FCC. The first requirement is related to income, and establishes that only families whose income is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty line can participate in the program.

[the_ad id=""2922""]<!-- Resources New-->

For example, to qualify for the program, a family of three must earn less than $22,000 each year. Some states have raised the bar to compensate for higher costs of living. There, the threshold can be as high as 175 percent of the federal poverty line. Interested families should contact a local Lifeline-approved carrier to inquire about income requirements.

Second, households must participate in at least one financial assistance program run by the federal government. This includes Medicaid, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, among others.

However, not all federal assistance programs are valid. In general, only those that provide some form of monetary subsidy are accepted by Lifeline carriers. Families should consult their local company to see which programs are accepted.

Members of tribes can sidestep this requirement, as most states categorize such populations as automatically eligible for Lifeline coverage. Some Lifeline carriers even offer special tribal packages that are designed to best address their needs.

Veterans that receive any form of special benefit are also automatically eligible for a Lifeline account. Citizens with severe disabilities, such as those with combined vision and hearing loss, can seek help from the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program to get their Lifeline account set up and receive special cell phones.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Help Paying Energy Bill with LIHEAP</h3>
The average household spends around $1,000 on electricity bills each year. This can be a significant amount of money when income is scarce or when people become unemployed. To help low income families facing this problem, federal the government has created the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also known as LIHEAP.

Through this program, households receive subsidies to cover the cost of cooling and heating bills. The program also provides protection if an emergency happens, such as during utility shutoffs. In some cases, recipients can also use the subsidy to pay for low-cost home improvements, or weatherization, that reduce energy spending.

Eligibility for LIHEAP is determined by each state, but some requirements are consistent across state lines. For example, households who are enrolled in other financial assistance programs such as Medicare or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are automatically eligible for LIHEAP benefits.

However, the amount of money available through this program is finite and awarded on a first come, first served basis. Once funds run out, households would have to wait until the following year to gain access to the subsidies. State legislators often pass emergency bills that extend funding for the program when they consider it necessary.

Families must keep in mind that in most cases LIHEAP will only cover a part of their energy bills. Some households are also only subsidized for a particular type of energy, such as heating or electricity, but not both. Interested parties should contact their local office to know which type of coverage is available and how much money will they save.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Help Paying Medical Bills with CHIP and Medicaid</h3>
Most families are living one medical bill away from financial hardship. As a result, finding help covering medical expenses is a priority for families struggling to get by. Luckily, the federal government operates several assistance programs that help those who need it most. Together, these programs offer much-needed subsidies to more than 60 million people who would otherwise not have access to quality healthcare.

Medicaid and Medicare are the largest healthcare assistance programs run by the government. They offer subsidies to most low income families, senior citizens and disabled people. Families with young children can enhance their coverage through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. This program was created in 1997 to give children health insurance in cases where they would not have access to it.

State and local governments also run several assistance programs that complement the subsidies families receive. Among them are prescription medication aid, which helps people who cannot pay for medication; rental assistance, which can cover a portion or all rental bills of families depending on their condition; and mortgage assistance, which helps families refinance their mortgages to obtain lower interest rates and monthly payments.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Households can visit their local social security office to find out which programs are available in their area. Also, looking for cheaper health insurance policies is always a good idea. Most plans go up in price after a few years, reducing their affordability. When that happens, searching for a new one is the right step to make.

Websites like HealthCare.gov, a government-sponsored health insurance marketplace, offer affordable plans for people who are not eligible for Medicare or whose employer does not provide healthcare. The marketplace is also available to self-employed citizens and people looking for a better option than the one provided by their employer.

The cost of living has been rising in the last few years, pushing many low income households to search for solutions. The federal programs mentioned above are only one way families can obtain assistance to cover basic expenses, and possibly find a way out of financial hardship.

Although each program alone may not seem to help that much, together they can make a difference, saving families thousands of dollars each year.","The fact is that 1 in every 5 Americans accept some sort of public assistance every month to turn their lives around for the better according to the US Census.","2019-06-10 20:37:51",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/applying-for-public-assistance-programs-without-the-stigma-online-and-anonymous/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/publicAssistance_img01.jpg,publicAssistance_img01.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/publicAssistance_img01.jpg,2933,publicAssistance_img01,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/publicAssistance_img01.jpg,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,applying-for-public-assistance-programs-without-the-stigma-online-and-anonymous,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:21"

The federal government operates an assistance program called LifeLine that helps qualifying low-income families across the country get a free cell phone and phone service. We’ll offer information here about how it works and the steps to follow to sign up.

This program was established in 1985 and is administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC). It is one of the many programs that the federal government maintains under a system of telecommunication subsidies called the Universal Service Fund. 

Since its introduction, Lifeline has helped more than 15 million households get access to free cell phones and quality wireless and landline phone service.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How to Qualify for a Free Phone from the Government</h3>
To get a free phone from the government through the Lifeline assistance program, households need to meet certain criteria designed to certify that they require financial support to access all of the benefits of having a cell phone, such as being able to find jobs, contact family members and handle emergencies. There are two ways to qualify for a Lifeline account: via participation in federal or state assistance programs or total household income.

Most low-income households qualify for Lifeline due to their participation in a federal or state assistance program. In general, authorities and designated providers take that as proof enough of eligibility, and as a result do not go through the hassle of verifying financial need all over again.

Instead, they require a card or award letter that confirms the requesting party’s participation in the federal programs that are accepted as proof of eligibility, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8), Veterans Pension and Survivor’s Benefit, and Medicaid. Interested parties can contact their local Lifeline provider to request more information about the process.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

If no household members are participants in a federal program, they can still qualify for a free cell phone via their total household income. All they need to do is provide proof of income through a pay stub or tax return. Similar to how housing assistance programs work, families can request assistance if their income falls below 135%, 150% or 175% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), depending on which state they live and which provider they choose to request the assistance from.

As of 2018, the FPG determines $12,140 as the minimum income a single-person household must have to be above the poverty level in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The number increases to $13,960 for Hawaii and $15,810 for Alaska. For families of more than one member, the number increases by $4,320 for each additional person in all states but Hawaii ($4,970) and Alaska ($5,400). For example, a family of three that lives in Hawaii would need to earn less than $32,265 to qualify for a Lifeline account.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How to Apply for a free Phone from the Government</h3>
Households who meet the criteria by either being part of a federal assistance program or due to their total income can contact a Lifeline provider located in their state. To sign up for this assistance program, the following information must be provided: full legal name, date of birth, social security or tribal identification number, address, and the qualifying federal program or proof of annual household income. If the household already receives service from the provider, they can request the benefit be applied to their existing account.

Once they have signed up, households can choose which phone they would like to receive as part of the Lifeline program. Several carriers such as Assurance Wireless offers their customers Android-powered smartphones as part of their Lifeline service.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

There are some restrictions that qualifying families must take into account when requesting assistance through the Lifeline program. For example, only one Lifeline account is allowed per household, and it has to be either wireless or landline, but not both. It is important that families understand their needs before requesting assistance.","Years ago lawmakers failed at getting phone companies to voluntarily lower the cost for basic cell phone service, but they were able to secure federal funds towards creating a free cell phone program called LifeLine.","2019-06-10 21:18:07",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-identify-a-thieving-phone-company-and-switch-to-a-free-phone/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PhoneComp_01.jpg,PhoneComp_01.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PhoneComp_01.jpg,2935,PhoneComp_01,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PhoneComp_01.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-identify-a-thieving-phone-company-and-switch-to-a-free-phone,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 14:03:41"

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aspiration offers more than just banking services. The company also allows customers to invest their money in a range of actively managed funds. The minimum investment is $10, although some investment forms will have to be submitted. Aspiration is a company that focuses on renewable energy, and as such, the investment funds available to customers are 100 percent fossil fuel free.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, the company offers the option to start saving for retirement with two tax deferred individual retirement accounts, which can be opened with as little as $10. The money will be invested in fossil fuel free funds with promising growth potential and lucrative returns.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Customers who contribute to charities in order to enjoy some tax breaks and deductions can do so from their Aspiration account. The company is partnered with a long list of charities, giving account holders the chance to send money to help with the environment, healthcare, poverty and education. Also, Aspiration will donate $25 to a chosen charity whenever a customer refers a friend.</span>
<h3><b>Why choose Aspiration</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aspiration is a California startup that operates based on fairness. This means there are no expensive fees to worry about. Instead, customers can choose how much they want to pay the bank each month for its services. This amount can go from $0 to $10, and can be changed whenever customers want to. Also, the company pledges ten percent of their income to nonprofit organizations and charitable causes.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But how much can you actually save by switching to Aspiration? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to a 2017 Bank Finder Report, the average account holder pays $330 each year in fees. By </span><a style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #009cff;"" href=""http://c.ufn-resources.com/click.aspx?cid=53655&provider_id=[pid]&cqs=idx&md5=[md5]"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">moving their money to Aspiration</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, they will only pay between $0 and $120 in fees, depending on how much they want to pay. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aspiration offers cash back rewards for purchases made with their debit cards. This benefit is often not available in traditional brick and mortar institutions, which only offer cash backs and rewards on their credit cards. Switching to Aspiration can help customers save an additional $54 per year in cash backs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another compelling reason to </span><a style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #009cff;"" href=""http://c.ufn-resources.com/click.aspx?cid=53655&provider_id=[pid]&cqs=idx&md5=[md5]"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">open an Aspiration account</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is its annual interest rates. The majority of traditional financial institutions offer a very low 0.1 percent annual interest rate on their savings accounts. To attract customers, some banks offer promotional rates that can go as high as 2.5 percent. However, these rates are often available as long as customers maintain a significant amount of money in their accounts. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, Wells Fargo offers a premium savings account that comes with 2.15 percent annual interest rate for the first twelve months. However, customers must maintain a balance of at least $25,000 to qualify for the promotional rate. According to Maurie Backman from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Motley Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, over 40 percent of households do not have $400 in cash at hand. Also, according to a report by the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the median savings account balance is $8,100. This means most families do not have enough cash to enjoy these promotional rates.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Aspiration offers a 2 percent fixed annual interest rate on savings accounts. This means households can enjoy better returns on their money regardless of how much they can afford to save. For example, a family who saves $10,000 on a traditional savings account would gain around $10 after one year. With an Aspiration Spend and Save account, they would make $200 instead. Also, money deposited in an Aspiration account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, for up to $1 million, which means families are not at risk of losing their money.</span>
<h3><b>How to Open an Aspiration account</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Signing up for an Aspiration online savings account can be completed in under twenty minutes and only requires a $10 initial deposit. However, customers must </span><a style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: #009cff;"" href=""http://c.ufn-resources.com/click.aspx?cid=53655&provider_id=[pid]&cqs=idx&md5=[md5]"" target=""blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">create a user account with the institution</a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> before being allowed to submit an application for the special savings account.</span>

<script src=""//contextual.media.net/nmedianet.js?cid=8CUM6LC1H""></script>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first thing customers will need is an email account. Then, the bank will ask for other details, such as social security number. Only U.S. citizens or permanent residents can open an Aspiration bank account. Because this is an online account, customers will have to provide the details of a traditional bank account to link to. This is required in order to move money to and from the account.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Providing personal information is not enough to complete the process. To protect customers from identity theft, the bank also has a second step that involves several questions designed to determine whether the person creating the account is who they say they are. If the system is unable to verify the identity, an additional step must be completed.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This additional step often involves providing a picture of both a primary and secondary government identification document, such as a driver's license and bank statement. Once these documents are submitted, the bank will take up to three days to verify the information and activate the account.</span>","Here is a free cash back card that asks you how much you want to pay but you don’t have to pay anything.","2019-06-14 18:42:58",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/legally-you-have-a-right-to-refuse-atm-fees/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/onlineAccount.jpg,onlineAccount.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/onlineAccount.jpg,2937,onlineAccount,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/onlineAccount.jpg,"Financial Help","Help for families",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,legally-you-have-a-right-to-refuse-atm-fees,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:21"

Please note not everybody who applies will receive a grant. The current requirements are for non-traditional students. If you’re circumstances are motivating you, read on to take advantage of this opportunity.

One of the top programs for non-traditional students today is Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Online programs like SNHU are recruiting adults who demonstrate drive and ambition.

Combine ambitious students with online programs and what do you get? Awards and recognition is the answer, because SNHU consistently ranks among the best online colleges nationwide year after year.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, a degree from SNHU leads to real jobs. If you want the corner office, you may have to work for it, but these programs will get you in the door. In recent years the median earnings of a college graduate has been about $27,000 a year. </span><a style=""font-size: 13pt;"" href=""http://hardshipservices.guide/r/232c9ea8-7d22-4e31-826e-f040e7b0592f/%7Bpid%7D/%7Bcid%7D/%7Bmd5%7D""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, graduating from SNHU, will earn students an average $39,000 instead</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Take a moment to let that sink in. Graduates with an online degree can earn more than graduates from traditional 4 year universities.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After six years, SNHU graduates can expect to earn around $46,000. Some career paths are more lucrative with  one in four SNHU graduates earning more than $65,000 after completing their degree. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To understand why online education is so important for this generation, consider working parents. Attending college remains out of reach for many working parents who might not have time or money to invest in continuing education. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moving courses to the internet has been something like an evolution for single parents. With flexible schedules, parents have demonstrated they can succeed in continuing education.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One particularly moving story, comes from Elisa Magagna of Pocatello, Idaho. She was a single parent, age 31 earning $9.50 an hour. But she saw the opportunities a college degree could create. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elisa had to think of a way to get there. “I wasn’t making very much money at all, just above minimum wage.” A single mom of four kids, her goal was “to better myself and my life.” Magagna completed a bachelor’s degree online in business administration in just over three years. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">She kept working full time while raising her family. Guess what, she graduated in June 2017 and had only $3,000 in student loans. After graduating, her salary almost doubled to just under $20 an hour.</span>

It was founded more than 80 years ago and currently has around 70,000 students enrolled in undergraduate studies and 20,000 completing graduate courses. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here is a comprehensive look at SNHU and why students find its degree programs attractive.</span>
<h3><b>What degree programs are offered at SNHU?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Southern New Hampshire University offers a wide variety of degree programs, including associate’s, bachelor’s , master’s and doctoral degrees. The institution offers degrees in many subjects, including accounting, finance, healthcare, aeronautics, nursing and education. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the university focuses on practical career paths such as engineering, there are still some degree programs that are more academic in nature. One example is their bachelor’s degree in anthropology.</span>

<h3><b>How much does it cost to attend SNHU?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The cost to attend Southern New hampshire University will vary according to several factors. This includes which degree program is chosen, whether the student will require university housing, and amount of student aid available. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, the institution does determine some costs beforehand. For example, each bachelor’s degree course has a cost of around $970. Master’s degree courses have a much higher price of almost $1,900. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The cost to attend SNHU is around $16,000 per semester for undergraduate students. However, the amount can be lower depending on how much financial assistance each student receives from the government. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In total, it would take around $40,000 to complete an undergraduate degree in the institution, which is much lower than similar universities around the country. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to online degrees, tuition costs drop significantly. </span><a style=""font-size: 13pt;"" href=""http://hardshipservices.guide/r/232c9ea8-7d22-4e31-826e-f040e7b0592f/%7Bpid%7D/%7Bcid%7D/%7Bmd5%7D""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Students can complete their online degree for less than $15,000</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Prospective students can check the estimated cost of their program of choice by visiting the SNHU website and using their comprehensive tuition calculator.</span>
<h3><b>How long does it take to finish an SNHU program?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Southern New Hampshire University offers several track courses students can choose from. On campus students can choose to study full-time or part-time, whereas online students can select how many subjects they want to attend each academic period. Full-time students often take two courses per eight week period. Part-time students only take one course.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Under normal circumstances, students can finish their courses in the corresponding time. This is two years for associate’s degrees and four years for a bachelor's degree.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Part-time students will take almost twice as much time to finish their course. For online students, the time it takes to graduate will depend on how many courses they sign up for every academic period.</span>

Today, there is a range of jobs creating lots of flexibility to work from home. Completing online surveys is one source of income hiring right now and these jobs don’t require having completed a college degree.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s a good deal for companies too, online surveys are tools used by companies to understand the appeal of their products and services. People can take advantage of their spending routines to make some money by giving their opinion on the products they buy or the services they use. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we provide basic information about online surveys, things to consider when filling them, and a list of sites actively hiring for survey responders.</span>
<h3><b>What are online surveys?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Online surveys are digital questionnaires promoted by companies. Their purpose is to gather valuable information from people in order to improve their product, service or brand. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Participants are often paid in return for such information. Some companies pay participants in cash, while others prefer to offer cash equivalents such as coupons and gift cards.</span>

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most online surveys can be completed in twenty minutes. In general, they ask participants if they use one or more specific products, as well as their personal opinion on their quality and price. However, not everyone can participate in an online survey. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Companies create criteria that potential participants must match before they are allowed to participate in any given survey. Some companies establish these criteria by asking participants to create an account and provide basic information about them.</span>

<h3><b>What is required to complete online surveys</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Homeowners and renters who are thinking about doing online surveys on their spare time must prepare beforehand. First, they should make a list of brands whose services or products they purchase to measure how many online surveys they could realistically complete. However, most homeowners qualify for surveys that seek information about things almost everyone pays for, such as utility bills or groceries.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, people should be aware that most online survey platforms pay through Paypal. As a result, participants will have to create a Paypal account and link it to their bank accounts. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Setting up a Paypal account is not complicated. A valid email account and identification number is all that is required to start receiving money. However, participants who prefer to cash out their rewards in gift cards may skip this step.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Third, some survey sites award points after each survey is complete. Rewards can be claimed once a certain number of points have been earned. In other cases, participants are given a flat amount of money per survey. However, sites who award money right away may impose minimum withdrawal limits, which can be between $50 and $100.</span>

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://c.ufn-resources.com/click.aspx?cid=53964&provider_id=[pid]&cqs=idx&md5=[md5]"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-446"" src=""http://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey5-300x166.png"" alt="""" width=""650"" height=""359"" /></a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Finally, participants should be willing to provide personal information. Online surveys often ask questions that some people might be uncomfortable answering. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is recommended to read the fine print before signing up and understanding the nature of each survey before agreeing to participate in them. Most websites allow participants to abandon the survey if they do not agree with any of the questions.</span>
<h3><b>Things to consider when doing online surveys</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of which site they choose, participants must always read the fine print and be fully aware of all the terms and conditions. Despite their simplicity, online surveys can take a significant amount of time when added up. As a result, it is important to focus on a single survey website until enough points have been earned and a reward can be claimed. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jumping between survey sites is not recommended. Participants who do so often end up spreading their points across multiple platforms, claiming fewer rewards and thus making less money. However, participants are encouraged to test different alternatives after claiming a reward if the chosen survey site failed to meet expectations.</span>

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3><b>Best online survey sites</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Online surveys are one of many possibilities struggling families can exploit to help cover monthly expenses. Although $2 for a single survey may seem like a drop in a bucket, after a month of casual work, diligent people can add $200 to their pocket. In this section, we offer a list of ten online survey sites that offer reliable rewards.</span>

<b>1. PaidViewPoint</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PaidViewPoint is one of the best survey sites on the Internet. It has a long list of comprehensive surveys which take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete. Participants can withdraw their earnings starting from $15, either as cash to a Paypal account or as an Amazon or Walmart gift card. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PaidViewPoint has become one of the best places for people looking to make extra money with online surveys. This is because of its simple interface and easy registration process.</span>

<b>2. VIP Voice</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">VIP Voice is an online research community that belongs to the NPD Group. With more than 3 million users, VIP Voice is one of the largest survey sites on the Internet. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Homeowners and renters who decide to join this community will get about 3 to 5 surveys each week, with the potential to make around $30 each month with little effort. VIP Voice does not give direct cash rewards. Instead, members receive points which can be used to enter sweepstakes and auctions. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winning a sweepstake may award cash, vacations and more. Auctions allow members to bid on products and services. Students may find VIP Voice an attractive proposition due to the $5,000 scholarship opportunity it provides to its members.</span>

<b>3. Swagbucks</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Swagbucks is a well-known online money making website, offering many alternatives to make quick cash beyond surveys. However, online surveys are one of its most popular features. Swagbucks is very newcomer-friendly, awarding free points to its members. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It also awards $5 to new members who complete one survey right after they sign up. Users of this website can withdraw their earnings to a Paypal account or through gift cards from known retailers like Amazon.</span>

<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://c.ufn-resources.com/click.aspx?cid=53964&provider_id=[pid]&cqs=idx&md5=[md5]"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-442"" src=""http://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/link1-300x162.png"" alt="""" width=""650"" height=""352"" /></a>

<b>4. Toluna </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Toluna is another popular survey panel used by a large number of marketing companies around the world. Although it offers other products and services, the survey panel remains its most popular membership program. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each completed survey grants a number of points which can be exchanged for a voucher after enough points have been earned. Most surveys take 15 minutes to complete. In general, it takes about 4 hours to gather 80,000 points and turn them into a $15 voucher.</span>

<b>5. MyPoints</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">MyPoints was established in 1996 as a rewards program website. Registered members can collect points by completing purchases from selected retailers. To collect points faster, members can complete daily online surveys. Unlike other survey panels, MyPoints rewards its members even if they are disqualified from a survey. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Online surveys are not the only way to collect points on this website. Inviting friends, playing select games and printing coupons also give a considerable amount of points. Money earned can be exchanged for gift cards or sent to a Paypal account.</span>

<b>6. Opinion Outpost </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opinion Outpost is an online market research pioneer. This decade-old free community offers rewards for sharing opinions on certain products and services. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The website is one of the most reliable in terms of fast payments, as it often takes less than several hours to deposit earnings. Those who decide to join can claim rewards as cash to a Paypal account or as iTunes and Amazon gift cards.</span>

<b>7. One Opinion</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One Opinion is similar to other free online communities mentioned above. Members are asked to share their opinions on selected products and services in return for points which can be traded for cash through Paypal or Visa prepaid cards. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People can make hundreds of points per day by completing surveys, including those in which they were disqualified. The minimum amount that can be redeemed is 25,000 points which is equal to $25.</span>

<b>8. Survey Junkie </b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Survey Junkie is a popular alternative for people who already tested other paid survey websites. The company does not have a mobile app, which means that most of its surveys are meant to be completed on a computer. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, its constant stream of quality surveys and flexible payment methods make up for the lack of mobile options. Also, earnings are available for withdrawal as soon as $10 or 1,000 points are reached, a lower amount than most other survey sites.</span>

<b>9. PointClub</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PointClub offers much more variety than its competitors. Like many other popular survey sites, PointClub rewards points even if the member gets disqualified. However, it stands out due to its extensive reward options, which include Visa prepaid cards, Walmart and Amazon gift cards, and movie vouchers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The downside of PointClub is its high requirements for withdrawal. The only options are 25,000 points for a $25 gift card or 50,000 points for $50 sent to a Paypal account.</span>

<b>10. Harris Poll </b>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Harris Poll is not as popular as other alternatives, mostly due to its focus on packaged food products. However, the companies looking to perform market research through this website tend to offer much higher pay than other online survey platforms. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, a standard survey on Harris Poll pays between $3 and $4 and can be completed in less than 20 minutes. There are more comprehensive surveys called local panels that can take two to four hours to complete but pay as much as $75. Harris Poll is a potential gold mine for food enthusiasts.</span>","If you’ve gone shopping in the last couple months, you could make good money answering questions online.","2019-07-01 20:53:20",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/try-earning-money-as-a-mystery-shopper-online/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyufn.png,surveyufn.png,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyufn.png,2942,surveyufn,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyufn.png,Resources,_redirect|_welcomehome,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,try-earning-money-as-a-mystery-shopper-online,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-11 16:10:27"

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But how do you know if your family qualifies as low income? The government has its definition, but here is a more practical explanation. If there is no chance of a  vacation this summer, no prospects for a new car to replace an aging one, living paycheck-to-paycheck with no savings — this is what low income in America looks like.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The cost of living has risen by about 30% in the last ten years, forcing most people to borrow something just to live. But check it out, there are some shortcuts to get debt paid off. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this guide, we offer a list of suggestions that, when followed, can greatly reduce the principal balance owed. We include information about easy-to-follow practices designed to reduce spending, avoid common mistakes, and efficiently tackle your debt. Along the way we offer some suggest some sponsored services who specialize in negotiating down debt.</span>
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Big Picture</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting out of debt requires a clear understanding of how much money is being owed. A surprising amount of people ignore how large their debt actually is, believing that paying off their bills is enough to eventually get rid of it. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although it is certainly true that getting out of debt may seem like an impossible feat, many Americans have reduced or eliminated their debt altogether in the past. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doing so requires discipline, determination, and a comprehensive understanding of the problem’s dimensions. Knowing exactly how much money is owed is a good first step. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Financial institutions are willing to provide detailed information about your debt, and from there you can start working towards reducing it. Remember, as high as it may be, your debt will go nowhere else but down if you follow the suggestions in this guide.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Control Your Spending</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Controlling spending, especially spending financed by debt, must be done before getting into the business of paying off existing debt. Your debt will continue to grow if expenditures are higher than monthly payments. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A general rule to follow is “if you don’t really need it, don’t buy it.” Unnecessary spending is one of the main causes of excessive credit card debt in the United States, downgrading families’ credit scores as a result. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some families have a hard time cutting spending due to lack of organization with their finances. To fix this problem, households can track all of their expenses during a month and determine which items should go away. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reducing unnecessary spending is important because it gives people access to additional money that could be put towards paying off debt.</span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Create a Budget</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spending control goes hand in hand with a responsible budget. Families should always have a list of mandatory expenses, including food and utility bills, to understand how much money they have to spend on a monthly basis. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A budget will help them identify which expenses are unnecessary as well as the difference between their earnings and expenditures, which is called a deficit. The main purpose of a budget is to quantify the deficit and cut the items that generate it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Subscriptions and other recurrent expenses may seem insignificant at first. However, when added up, they can represent a large part of a family’s expenses. For example, a $65 monthly Cable TV subscription may not look like a sizable expenditure, yet it becomes a significant money sink when compared with Netflix’s comparable $8 monthly service. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A family could save up to $50 if they are eligible to get free phone service from the government through the Lifeline program.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is only one example of how creating a budget can help families single out expenditures that could be replaced with cheaper options or removed altogether. It also helps them determine if they need financial assistance. A family with elevated food spending may want to request assistance from the government.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Almost all states have home energy programs that subsidize heating and cooling for families within the required income levels. Contacting local agencies to find out which programs can help reduce spending is a good next step after a budget has been designed.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Organize Your Debt</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Organizing all outstanding debt is the next step after you go through the process of creating a budget and cutting unnecessary spending. To do this, you must have all the relevant information, including amounts, interest rates, minimum payments and more. Remember that most financial institutions will provide this information if requested through a call or online banking system, if available.</span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two methods to organize debt. The first one is where all debt is listed from smallest to largest regardless of interest rates. People can build momentum with this method because smaller debt is paid off quickly, consolidating efforts on larger debt like student loans. The downside of this path is inefficient exploitation of low interest rates, which saves the most money over time.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second method does take into account interest rates. It’s called “laddering” and it works by listing all debts beginning with those with highest interest rates. Due to it focusing on eliminating high interest debt before everything else, laddering is considered to save the most money in the long term. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Debt with high interest rates generates larger monthly payments. Working to reduce it first will help you ease the burden on paychecks and improve your credit score at the same time.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paying Off Your Debt</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whichever method you choose, the trick is to stick to it. Switching plans along the way will have a negative effect on your finances. If needed, a family could design a hybrid plan to work with, paying off small debt right away. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Subsequently, they can switch to a laddered approach to tackle high interest rates. Excess cash generated from spending control and budget analysis can be used to speed up the process of paying off debt.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you’re ready to start paying off your debt, make sure you keep the following suggestions in mind. First, always try to pay more than the minimum payment established by the financial institution. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Contrary to popular belief, minimum payments do not contribute towards reducing outstanding debt. In many cases, they end up enlarging it instead. Banks and other financial institutions set minimum payments low enough to make sure debt either grows or remains intact over time.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second recommendation is to throw as much money as possible towards paying off debt. In the previous sections, we offered suggestions to cut spending and responsibly organize a budget. Excess money that will no longer be spent on unnecessary stuff should be used to tackle the debt. </span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may ask why is this useful, but remember that the more money being put today, the less interest being paid tomorrow.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try to avoid common mistakes people make on their way out of debt. Among the most common mistakes is closing accounts once the balance has been paid off. Although reducing the number of open accounts seems like a good idea, in reality it tends to have the opposite effect. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In our guide about how to improve credit scores we talk about the credit utilization ratio, which is obtained by dividing a household’s credit card balance by their total available credit. Paying off debt reduces credit card balance. However, if you close an account, it reduces your total available credit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s no secret that despite the promising economy, many Americans find themselves with more debt each year. The average household in the United States owes at least $130,000 between their mortgage, student or auto loans and credit card debt. That number can be daunting, but with discipline and determination it could go down significantly in a few years.</span>","The debt burden is all the more heavier for low-income families, but there are resources to help. ","2019-07-09 18:20:08",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/special-debt-relief-programs-for-families/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jvbsakjfgsfk.png,jvbsakjfgsfk.png,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jvbsakjfgsfk.png,2944,DebtForgiveness,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jvbsakjfgsfk.png,Resources,"Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,special-debt-relief-programs-for-families,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:21:39"
3152,"Continuing Education Grants For Families","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

In this article, we explore the different methods that low-income families and individuals can take advantage of to obtain the degree they desire. We provide information about grants, scholarships and other resources that is easy to understand and that can prove consequential in the road out of financial hardship.
<h3>Education Grants</h3>
Educational grants are usually given by academic institutions and non-profit organizations to individuals with high qualifications that require financial assistance to continue their studies. Along with scholarships, educational grants are one of the most popular resources that many pre-graduate students rely on to go through college.

[the_ad id=""758""] <!-- AdSense -->

Educational grants don’t have to be repaid, but most institutions have a long list of requirements that applicants must meet before they are awarded the money they need to cover their college and living expenses. For example, they must have high grades and a clean record, and some organizations also request recommendations from academic institutions.
<h3>Pell Grants</h3>
The Pell Grant is a subsidy provided by the United States government to students who are in financial need and cannot afford to pay for college. It was created in 1965 and since then has become one of the most popular educational grants in the world, helping more than 5.5 million college and vocational school students across the country.

Pell Grants are considered as the bedrock above which a student’s financial aid is established. Most Pell recipients enjoy the benefits of other forms of aid that are attached to their grant as a single customized package that is adjusted to their needs. This money is then awarded to each recipient on a yearly basis so that they can pay for any expenses.

The Department of Education maintains a standard formula that it uses to determine which students qualify to receive a Pell grant. The formula produces a number called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) which determines eligibility. In addition to that, applicants must also be undergraduate students who have yet to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Both U.S. citizens and permanent residents can apply.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

To receive the Pell grant, families must submit an application using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, commonly known as FAFSA. The form has to be submitted before the student starts their freshman undergraduate year and then each year as they progress through college. Each year, the government will review their application and determine how much money will be granted as a result. As of 2017, eligible students are given no more than $5,900 each year to cover their expenses.
<h3>FSEOG Grants</h3>
The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is another alternative that students can explore if they find themselves in a position where they cannot afford to pay for college. Similar to Pell Grants, FSEOG Grants are awarded to college undergraduate students and do not have to be repaid. A recipient of this grant receives between $100 and $4,000 each year to help them cover their college-related expenses.

To be eligible for a FSEOG grant, a student must meet certain requirements. First, their family must fill the FAFSA form to allow the government to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). This will determine if the student is in financial need, as well as how much money will be awarded by the grant. Second, the student must be a U.S. citizen. Permanent residents of the United States are not eligible for a FSEOG grant.

[the_ad id=""758""] <!-- AdSense  -->

FSEOG Grants can also be awarded directly to schools, which then choose which students are in financial need and how much money they require to successfully complete their school year. In this case, the federal government covers up to 75% of the grant, while the school is responsible for the remaining 25%. The amount of FSEOG money given to a school varies each year, depending on a variety of factors.
<h3>Scholarships</h3>
Scholarships are one of the most popular options for students all around the world. Many organizations and educational institutions award thousands of scholarships every year as students look for ways to reduce the costs to obtain their degrees. Like grants, scholarships award students with money to cover college expenses.

Some educational institutions make it so that scholarship recipients don’t have to pay to enroll and attend their schools. This is an invaluable resource for qualified students, paving the way for them to become successful professionals, and most importantly, achieve it debt-free.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Unlike grants, however, scholarships are given based on high grades or previous academic achievements. Some institutions also award scholarships based on individual talent. A big chunk of them are also handed out to individuals who focus on specific areas that the awarding institution is interested in pursuing, such as scientific research.
<h3>Student Loans</h3>
Student loans are a last-resort option for many individuals that desire to obtain a college degree but for a variety of reasons are unable to qualify for either a grant or a scholarship. Most of these loans come from banks, and can become a significant economic burden for students as they go through college due to lack of significant income or rising interest rates.

To alleviate this concern, the federal government offers students the option to apply for a stafford loan. These special government-sponsored loans are made available to students that enroll in accredited institutions across the country and offer significantly lower interest rates. They are divided into subsidized and unsubsidized versions, with the former being approved only to students with financial need as demonstrated through their FAFSA application and Expected Family Contribution.","For many parents, getting a college degree could become their ticket out of financial hardship.

3153,"Our Broke Neighbors Bought a Beautiful Home Using  Government Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You’ve heard some of the talk about home prices and the economy. Fact of the matter is that Governments want to see home sales rise. Along with home sales comes citizens with equity and wealth.

The United States government supports  several civic programs through agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) to help spur widespread homeownership.

Housing is such a fundamental precursor to building individual and national wealth that there are even  several assistance programs to cover apartments for low income renters. Below, are resources supported by both private and taxpayer dollars that all go towards supporting your American dream of owning a home. Especially for those facing financial hardship, this resource is intended for you.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3> Home Possible Mortgage Assistance Program</h3>
For first time home buyers, the Home Possible mortgage offered by Freddie Mac is one of the best solutions to purchase a home. Designed to benefit very low and low income families, this loan doesn’t require the borrower to have a credit score. It also offers comfortable interest rates, flexible refinancing options, and a down payment of only 3%.

This means that a family looking to buy a house valued at $50,000 will only have to put down $1,500 as down payment before being approved to borrow the balance of the purchase price.. Freddie Mac often gives their borrowers up to 20 years to pay the money back, with options to refinance the mortgage if more beneficial terms become available..
<h3>Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM)</h3>
The Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) provides special benefits to borrowers who plan to buy a house that is energy efficient, or that can be made energy efficient by performing improvements that will reduce energy consumption.

This relatively new mortgage is a powerful tool that households have at their disposal when purchasing a more comfortable home with lower energy bills. To qualify for this unique mortgage loan, the borrower must obtain a home energy assessment to certify that the home they plan to buy meets the required criteria.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME)</h3>
The HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) is a federal assistance program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with the purpose of providing affordable housing to low and very low income families across the country.

It is one of the largest federal block grants given to states, covering an extensive list of programs and services that help families going through financial hardship.

One key program is the home purchase or rehabilitation financing assistance. HOME can make a contribution towards a  down payment to help buyers qualify for a mortgage. Although not officially a grant, money awarded through this program doesn’t have to be paid back. Instead, the family has to handle the monthly payments of the loan.

Eligibility to this program is determined by the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG). Families must fall within the federal poverty level to be considered financially needy and qualify for this benefit. As of 2018, the poverty level is set around $12,000 a year in most states.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>203(k) Mortgage &amp; HomeStyle Renovation</h3>
The 203(k) Mortgage Rehab Insurance is a special type of loan sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) that assist people and families when buying a home that is not habitable and which needs to be repaired before it becomes so. This loan is useful for parties that are interested in purchasing a home that needs improvements but don’t have the money to cover both the required down payment and the renovation.

A similar option would be Fannie Mae’s HomeStyle Renovation mortgage. Like the 203(k) mortgage, families can finance the purchase and renovation of a home with this loan. However, it also includes the option to refinance the mortgage for up to 75% of the value of the home after repairs are made so that the family can perform the improvements they want.

203(k) and HomeStyle loans have strict requirements and guidelines that families must meet to become eligible. They require a contractor’s bid to be made to estimate the repair costs, as well as a down payment that oscillates between 3.5% and 5%. Also, unlike traditional mortgages, families are required to complete the renovations to access the part of the funds that were destined to pay the contractors.

Both loans are beneficial for low income families. They provide a way for families to improve their homes without having to face the high interest rates of a home equity line of credit or a second mortgage.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Rental Assistance</h3>
An increasing number of low income families across the country are unable to buy a house, preferring to rent instead. The federal government operates a variety of assistance programs designed to make it easier for households to address their monthly rent payments without it becoming an economic burden.

These housing programs are managed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and they provide financial assistance to families who need it most and are eligible to receive the benefits.

According to their needs, low-income families can apply for programs such as Section 8’s Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), which gives them a housing voucher that can be used to rent the house or apartment they desire, or the Project Based Section 8 Rental Assistance, which offers subsidies to landlords so that they can lower the monthly payments of tenants.","Owning a house is part of the American Dream.

<h3>Help Paying Phone Bill</h3>
Lifeline is a U.S. federal government program that provides landline and cellphone bill payment assistance to qualifying low-income families across the country. Lifeline accounts are handled by local providers who also offer free cell phones to families who need them most.

In addition to Lifeline, the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (NDBEDP) assists low-income citizens who have combined vision and hearing loss.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Help Paying Energy Bill</h3>
Energy bills can be overwhelming for many low-income families. To alleviate this financial burden, the federal government established the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to offer subsidies for power bills. Eligible U.S. citizens and legal aliens may apply to receive the benefits of this program if they need assistance with:
<ul>
 	<li>Paying cooling and heating bills</li>
 	<li>Emergencies, such as utility shutoffs</li>
 	<li>Low-cost home improvements, known as weatherization, that make your home more energy-efficient and lower your utility bills</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Help Paying Medical Bills</h3>
Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are two government programs that offer assistance with medical bills. Along with Medicare, they provide much-needed subsidies to more than 60 million Americans who would otherwise be left without access to quality health insurance.

Local social security offices have detailed information about which programs are available in the state to help reduce medical costs.

Looking for better health insurance programs is always a good idea. If your current plan is no longer affordable, it may be time to find a cheaper option. Websites like HealthCare.gov offer affordable health insurance plans for people who are not eligible for Medicare or currently don’t receive health coverage through their employer. The marketplace is also available to self-employed citizens and people looking for a better option than the one provided by their employer.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Other Bill Payment Assistance Programs</h3>
The federal government can help you pay other bills too, with programs that include:
<ul>
 	<li>Prescription medication aid, which offers financial support to people who cannot pay for their medication.</li>
 	<li>Rental assistance, which helps low-income families find affordable housing in selected properties across the country.</li>
 	<li>Mortgage assistance, which helps families refinance their mortgage to obtain better interest rates and more flexible options.</li>

3159,"Write This Hardship Letter To Get One Month Without Bills","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

In this article, we’ll discuss what a hardship letter is and things to consider during the writing process.
<h3>The Purpose of a Hardship Letter</h3>
Hardship is defined by events which negatively affect someone’s ability to cover payments. These events can include unemployment, medical emergencies, reduced annual income, divorce or family separation, military service, and more. Families under adjustable-rate loans may also qualify if the rates change significantly.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

Financial institutions need to know why someone is unable to continue paying a loan or bill before they agree to help. They also need to make sure the borrower has put forth a good faith effort but still without success. A hardship letter accomplishes these since it explains why a person is no longer able to meet financial responsibilities.
<h3>Tips to Remember When Writing a Hardship Letter</h3>
A hardship letter needs to make a convincing argument to make the payment terms of a loan more manageable. To achieve that result, those writing must make sure the hardship letter includes several things.

First, the letter has to explain how the individual reached financial hardship. This involves talking about personal decisions, external factors, and anything else which may have played a role in falling into hardship. The more details included, while still writing concisely, the better.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

For example, a family interested in refinancing their home payments should explain real estate market changes in the area and how they affected the value of their property. Sometimes, financial institutions require documentation supporting the claims made in the hardship letter, such as statistical data from government agencies or an unemployment certificate. For this reason, it’s essential to be truthful.

Second, the individual should discuss what they have done to improve the situation. Proving that hardship exists is often not enough to obtain more generous terms from a lender. They need examples of how the individual has tried to remain financially responsible, such as by reducing expenses or joining job search platforms.

Finally, the letter needs to discuss how previous attempts at improving the situation have failed. If this part of the message lacks detail and doesn’t relay the fact that hardship still exists, the financial institution could reject the request.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

Speaking of detail, including plenty of it may be the most important tip to remember when writing a hardship letter. Describing the impact of each event is an efficient way to paint the correct picture. Relying on numbers is vital to help lenders understand how difficult the situation is and put items such as income loss and negative cash flow into context.

A customer who had to borrow from their credit card to cover payments should explain so in the letter, including detailed information such as the exact amount and credit line source. In some cases, borrowers have to rely on family members or withdraw from retirement savings accounts to stay afloat. These events should be mentioned in a hardship letter.

In addition to detail, keep in mind when writing the hardship letter that financial institutions only care about getting paid. Protecting the borrower's finances is not their responsibility. As a result, the letter must convince the bank that approving your request is the only way to keep payments on schedule.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Some people may feel tempted to end the hardship letter on a positive or optimistic note. Doing so might have adverse effects, as the financial institution will use any evidence of potential recovery as an excuse to deny refinancing a loan or mortgage.

As we’ve discussed above, it is crucial to mention which measures were taken to improve finances, but the person must be clear that all attempts have failed. Otherwise, the bank will ask the borrower to come back later.","When financial difficulty comes and you need to refinance a loan or mortgage, writing a hardship letter might be necessary.","2019-09-09 16:15:06",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/use-this-hardship-letter-template-to-get-one-month-with-zero-bills-to-pay/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_459573091.jpg,shutterstock_459573091.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_459573091.jpg,2958,shutterstock_459573091,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_459573091.jpg,Housing,"Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,use-this-hardship-letter-template-to-get-one-month-with-zero-bills-to-pay,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:29"
3160,"The Best Short-Term Money Sources for Families","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3>Finding Unclaimed Money</h3>
Before seeking a loan that carries a cost via interest rates, it’s best to seek free avenues of funding. Unclaimed money is one of those.

Certain family members may have wages or tax refunds that were paid but left uncollected. In these cases, they probably don’t even know they’re owed money. Luckily, there are several ways to find it.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AD02 -->

The IRS can offer information on outstanding money owed from tax refunds. An FDIC search can show if any unclaimed funds exist due to bank failures. Unclaimed deposits may be waiting to be scooped up by members of defunct credit unions.  Enrollees of Veterans Affairs (VA) can see if any unclaimed life insurance funds are due. There are also state registries that can reveal similar information.
<h3>Grants for Families</h3>
If a family isn’t owed any money, they could still get free funding via grants, as long as they comply with regulations. These sums of money do not have to be paid back. Where do they come from? Non-profit organizations or the government, which offer grants totaling billions of dollars per year.

What can a family do with grant money? That depends on the grant, but the uses can be numerous. A teen can use the money to go to college. It can be used for home maintenance. Several grants also help people start businesses so they can secure their family’s financial future.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Getting Payday or Personal Loans</h3>
If unclaimed money and grants aren’t available, a family’s emergency could be resolved with a payday loan. In this case, a lender gives a borrower a short-term loan that they agree to pay back when their next payday hits. Sometimes referred to as cash advance loans or payroll loans, these types of emergency funding used to be more widespread. High interest rates triggering regulation has tarnished payday loans to the point they’ve become illegal in several states.

Before applying for a payday loan, some research must be done to see if it’s legal in the state where the family resides. Payday loans are currently illegal in the following states:
<ul>
 	<li>Georgia</li>
 	<li>New York</li>
 	<li>New Jersey</li>
 	<li>Arizona</li>
 	<li>North Carolina</li>
 	<li>Connecticut</li>
 	<li>Maryland</li>
 	<li>Massachusetts</li>
 	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
 	<li>Vermont</li>
 	<li>West Virginia</li>
 	<li>Washington, D.C.</li>
</ul>

If the family resides in a state where payday loans are legal, the next step is to find an adequate lender. This can be done online or by visiting a local storefront. In terms of cost, many lenders charge a percentage or a certain amount for every $100 borrowed. This amount is used to determine the annual percentage rate or APR. Before any agreement is made, the lender must disclose this rate to the borrower.

With the lender selected and the APR disclosed, the last step is to determine how much will be borrowed and when it will be paid back. Since payday loans tend to coincide with the borrower’s next paycheck, the maximum term is often 14 days.

Should a payday loan seem too costly, a family may seek financing from a personal loan. Although it may sound like a payday loan, both are quite different. Personal loans can have a repayment period of two to five years, while payday loans can max out at 14 days. Payday loans also come in smaller amounts than personal loans, while having higher interest rates. For these reasons, a payday loan should be used for minor emergencies.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h3>Auto Loans for Family Cars</h3>
A common emergency many families face is car trouble. Whether a major repair is needed or the car needs to be replaced altogether, <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/general-1/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">an auto loan can remedy the situation</a> in a more direct manner than other forms of funding. There are a plethora of institutions across the country that will offer reasonable financing to help families get reliable transportation for work, school, and more.
<h3>Using a Credit Union</h3>
Becoming a member of a credit union is a great way to get access to short-term funds. Membership usually requires some type of donation to a non-profit organization.

Similar to a payday loan in form, but with better rates, a Salary Advance Loan is a new, popular way to get credit union funding. Credit unions also offer other funding options in the form of credit cards, low-interest rate mortgages, loans for rent, and more.

<h3>Small Dollar Loans</h3>
Somewhere in between payday loans and standard bank loans is the newly announced Small Dollar Loan, or SDL. It can provide lending for families with a maximum interest rate of 36% and a term of 90-plus days.","When a family faces emergency expenses and their financial stability is at risk, short-term funding can save the day.","2021-05-20 14:30:30",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/the-best-short-term-money-sources-for-families/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dependalble01.jpg,dependalble01.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dependalble01.jpg,2960,dependalble01,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dependalble01.jpg,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,the-best-short-term-money-sources-for-families,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-26 14:38:37"
3161,"Minimum Income You Need To Get A Mortgage","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

In this article, we try to break down how much income families really need to be approved for the most popular mortgage loans including FHA and USDA.
<h3>How much income is needed to get a mortgage?</h3>
Ultimately the total loan amount will include your down payment, the value of the house, and additional expenses such as home insurance and  property taxes.

In the next few sections, we will discuss how much income would be needed to purchase a $200,000 house with the minimum down payment amount permitted by loan regulations.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

We will also look at a jumbo loan with a  home valued at $485,000 to calculate the minimum income required to buy it. Readers should be advised that other external factors not accounted for here may also affect eligibility.
<h3>Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan</h3>
FHA loans require a down payment of between 3.5 and 10 percent depending on credit score. With a credit score of 500, someone would have to provide $20,000 to purchase a $200,000 home. This means lenders would have to finance the remaining $180,000.

If the family chooses a 30-year fixed interest mortgage, monthly payments might be around $1,200. Taking into account the debt-to-income ratio, the family would have to earn at least $2,400 each month, and have no debt, to be approved.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Families with credit scores above 580 can provide $7,000 instead as down payment. In such cases, lenders would finance $193,000 to complete the purchase. With a 30-year fixed interest mortgage, monthly payments would be $1,350. This means borrowers must earn at least $2,700 each month, and have no debt, to be approved.
<h3>Veteran (VA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loan</h3>
Veteran or VA loans do not typically require a down payment or private mortgage insurance, which is usually needed when borrowers provide less than 20 percent of the house’s value as a down payment.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

VA loans tend to have lower income requirements than other types of mortgages. For example, a veteran who wants to purchase a $200,000 house will have to pay around $1,100 each month. This number is lower than what they would have to pay with an FHA loan. Qualifying veterans would have to earn no less than $2,500 each month to be eligible for a VA mortgage loan.

USDA loans also do not require a down payment. However, borrowers must pay a 0.5 percent mortgage insurance premium. Also, although USDA loans are available to anyone, only houses in selected locations can be purchased. In general, only houses in rural and suburban areas can be acquired using a USDA loan.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Loans over $485,000 (Jumbo Loans)</h3>
Jumbo mortgages, or loans over $485,000, have additional requirements compared to smaller mortgages. Banks could require borrowers to have as much as twelve monthly payment in cash. At $485,000, this would mean having at least $80,000 in cash with monthly payments around $2,650.

Jumbo mortgages have a minimum down payment of 10 percent, which equals no less than $48,500 for the minimum mortgage amount.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

MyPoints works by inviting you to new surveys. As you take them, you earn points. Once you earn enough points, you get gift cards from your favorite brands that can keep cash in your wallet.

3163,"Is Your Family Overspending on Food?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->
Yes, eating is essential. Spending a ton on what you eat is not necessary, however.

While you may think your food expenses are under control, chances are you could be saving even more. In this quick guide, we’ll discuss various ways to save on food, so you have more to spend elsewhere.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Dump Those Expensive Drinks</h3>
You need to stay hydrated to feel energized and maintain mental clarity. You don’t need to hydrate with overpriced drinks that do more harm than good, though.

Water is perfectly fine. It’s hard to beat when it comes to beverages since it has no calories, no sugar, and is practically free. What’s the moral of the story? Stop paying so much for drinks other than water.

Soda and juice are loaded with sugars that can kickstart cravings. Once those cravings kick in, you’ll get the urge to buy food to calm them. What type of food is usually bought after drinking something sugary? Carb-filled food, which will trigger your cravings even more.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

You can end this vicious drink-related cycle by sticking to water. It doesn’t have to be the most expensive brand of the bottled stuff, either. Invest in a water filter for long-term savings, or you can enjoy good old tap water.

What’s a drink that can drain your bank account without you even knowing it? Coffee.

If you’re like most people, you drink more than one cup per day. And if you’re buying it from an expensive coffee shop, that daily drink can sap you dry.

Buy a reliable coffee maker for your home. Keep it in a thermos so you can enjoy it on the go. By making this simple move, you can cut your costs substantially.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Avoid Eating out</h3>
It’s no secret that eating out can pack a wallop on your wallet. Doing so daily can result in higher than average food expenses, so reserve dining out for special occasions.

Packing your lunch will keep money in your wallet. Also, it’s much healthier, which can cut your healthcare costs over the years.

If you don’t have time to cook every single day, start prepping your meals. For example, you can designate Sunday as your cooking day as you cook large batches of money-saving food. Freeze it and save it for later, and you’ll start saving money with ease.

<h3>Pack Snacks</h3>
Do you have a go-to snack you buy every single time you’re on the go? Instead of buying it from the convenience store each time, buy it in bulk at the grocery store.

Avoid the premium you pay at convenience stores just because they’re quick and close. You can get the same product at the store and keep it at home for less.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Stick to Your List</h3>
Make a complete grocery list once a week. Make sure it has everything you need so you can avoid multiple wallet-draining trips to the store.

Buy in bulk if you have room to store the food. It can provide significant savings over the year.

Lastly, make it a rule to only buy what’s on your list. If it’s not on the list, it doesn’t get purchased.

Impulse purchases can take a considerable chunk out of your budget, and they often involve things you don’t need.","Avoiding fine dining doesn’t necessarily mean your food spending is optimal.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to Consumer Reports, </span><a href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/02/how-to-find-lost-life-insurance-policies/index.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">forgotten or misplaced life insurance policies alone account for at least $1 billion in unclaimed benefits</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that being said, let’s look at why savings are important and how to start building them. Once you do, you’ll be able to have some peace of mind in this sometimes unpredictable world.</span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]

<b>The Exact Amount of Savings to Aim For</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you ready to find out how much you should have saved to stay afloat during an emergency? Here’s the answer, according to experts: Six months’ worth of emergency expenses.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If that sounds like a lot, it’s because it is, especially for families with tight finances. How much do six months of expenses equal? According to Bankrate, the amount is roughly $19,500 for a family of four.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you panic, know that most people in the United States do not have such savings. The Federal Reserve states that </span><a href=""https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/files/BulletinCharts.pdf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">only 80 percent of the top income earners have the appropriate savings for emergencies.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When it comes to median-income households, the majority have just 20 percent of the suggested savings. Lastly, a Bankrate survey found that only 29 percent of the adult population has six months of emergency expenses saved up. In other words, most are not prepared to meet a disaster head-on.  </span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<b>How to Start Saving for a Rainy Day</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Figuring out how much six months of expenses is off the top of your head can be difficult. That’s why your first step should be to write down which costs are not avoidable. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you lost your job, for example, pick the monthly expenses that must be paid each month, such as your mortgage, car payment, or health insurance.</span>
[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, assess your current situation. After determining which costs must be paid, multiply them by six. Do you have that amount saved? If not, it’s time to work your way up to it by saving now.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you can, set up automatic savings so that 5-10 percent of each paycheck goes directly to a savings account. Also, make it your goal to put as much cash as you can into savings until you accumulate at least one month’s worth of savings. Once you have that, aim for two, three, four, etc.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoid falling into a common trap that occurs to many “new” savers. Once they have three months’ worth of expenses saved, they tend to stop saving and feel comfortable with that amount. If you do the same, you could come up short when a long-term emergency arises.</span>

3166,"6 Hacks To Spend Less At The Gas Pump","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you drive a lot for work or any other reason, those frequent trips to the gas station can be downright traumatic. Whipping out your wallet to pay for ever-increasing gas prices is no fun, but if you start applying these six hacks, you could end up saving a bunch of coin over time.</span>
<h3><b>Don’t top off</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Topping off the tank when you pump gasoline could lead to waste.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you park on a hill or live in a particularly hot and sunny climate that causes gas to expand during daytime hours, overflow could occur. Once it does, it’s like pumping dollars down the drain.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You won’t find huge savings here. But every penny counts when you're trying to stack savings, so it’s a good practice to employ.</span>
[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3><b>Avoid full service</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">  </span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Believe it or not, some areas still have full-service stations. Although they may seem like excellent examples of customer service, you pay a premium for such attention.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Using self-serve instead can yield 5-10% savings over allowing an attendant to pump your gas for you.</span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]

<h3><b>Don’t let it get to E</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can be tempting to fill up only when you have to. But letting your gas tank dwindle to almost entirely empty levels can put a dent in your wallet.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since gas evaporates, having too much empty room in your tank accelerates the process. In other words, the emptier your tank, the more room the existing gas has to turn into vapor.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How do you combat this “drying up” of that gas you paid a premium for? By filling up as soon as your tank gets to a half-full (or half-empty) level.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3><b>Watch for gas trucks</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whenever you see a gas truck that’s refilling a station, avoid it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the new fuel is being pumped into those massive storage tanks, existing fuel gets stirred up. Pumping gas into your car at the same time could cause you to receive some residue in the form of dirt and sediment.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While they certainly do no favors for the performance of your vehicle, you’re still paying for those non-fuel particles since they count as part of that gallon you’re getting.</span>
<h3><b>Fill up in the A.M. hours</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The colder the temperature of the ground, the more money you’ll save.</span>

<!-- Google Adunit - Article inText -->
[the_ad id=""758""]
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gas station storage tanks sit beneath the ground, and they can take on the temperature of the land surrounding them. The colder the ground, the denser the gasoline in those tanks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s so good about dense gasoline? You get more for your money.</span>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fill up during the warm afternoon hours or at night after a scorching day, and the hot ground will cause the gasoline to expand. This expanded gasoline means you might pay for a gallon of the good stuff, but won’t get that exact amount in return.</span>

<h3><b>Use the GasBuddy app</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s no need to drive to every gas station in your town just to see who has the lowest price. With </span><a href=""https://www.gasbuddy.com""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the GasBuddy app</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, you can get an up-to-date map of gas prices in your area.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to quick price comparisons, GasBuddy lets you earn money for your future gas purchases when you shop at select retailers.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, if you shop at Old Navy to buy new clothes for your kids, you can get a percentage of that purchase applied as a discount on your next trip to the pump.  Do this with various participating retailers, and it's like clipping coupons for your car's fuel.</span>","Do you yearn for those years when gas was dirt-cheap?

3168,"Reduce Your Car Insurance Rates by Asking These 8 Questions","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may want to reserve a spot in your busy schedule for a phone call to your auto insurance agent. Why? So you can save some serious cash.

While you may think they have your best interests at heart, car insurance companies are in business to do one thing: cash in. For this reason, you may be overpaying for your car insurance and not even know it.

By calling your agent, you can ask some of the following questions to get your payment lowered while still protecting your vehicle.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>“Will my new car require any surcharges?”</h3>
If you’re buying a new car, call your agent and tell them the model you’d like to purchase. Then ask them if any surcharges could appear due to higher damage, repair, or theft costs for that model.

If you see it’s too costly to insure it, you may reconsider your purchase. Failing to ask this question could result in unexpected costs that will make your new car buying euphoria wear off with the quickness.
<h3>“Do I qualify for any additional discounts due to my car’s features?”</h3>
Having a theft-deterrent system on your car could lower your premium since it can be seen as a risk-reducer. OnStar or LoJack are examples of GPS trackers that fit this mold.

Safety features could result in savings as well. Airbags, anti-lock brakes, and daytime running lights are often standard on newer vehicles, but if you have an older car that has them, mention it to your agent.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>“I barely drive now. Can that lower my payment?”</h3>
If you recently retired, started carpooling with a friend to work, or made some other change that drastically reduced your mileage, let it be known. Some companies will grant you tremendous discounts if you drive fewer than 7,500 miles per year, for example.
<h3>“Do you offer homeowner’s insurance? If so, how much can I save by bundling?”</h3>
An easy way to save money on your car insurance is to bundle it with homeowner’s insurance under one policy. Beyond the cost-cutting advantage this provides, it can also be more convenient by having you deal with just one company for customer service.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>“Do you have any good student discounts?”</h3>
It pays to have a good student in your home. As long as they’re under 25 years of age and are in high school or college, they could qualify for a good student discount and 25% savings.
<h3>“How much can I save by increasing my deductible on auto collision insurance?”</h3>
An increase in your deductible could lead to a significant decrease in your premiums. This is a particularly good question to ask if you have a clean driving record.
<h3>“Can I drop my collision and comprehensive coverage?”</h3>
Ask this if your car is more than five years old and is worth less than $1,000. Cutting those coverages may be worth it.
[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>“Why should I stay with you?”</h3>
If you have a good driving record, it may be time to shop around for new coverage with a different company. Doing so can yield savings, so ask your current provider why you should stick with them.

If your driving record isn’t so good and you’re happy with the service you’re currently getting, however, you may want to stay.","Unless you love donating your hard-earned cash to your car insurance agent, you probably want to cut that cost pronto.

3169,"New To Medicare Open Enrollment? Here Are The Basics","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Taking advantage of Medicare open enrollment isn’t necessarily a must, but it can save you money and ensure you get the medical coverage you need for 2020.

To get you acquainted with this period of possible savings, here are some basics on the topic that you can digest in just a couple of minutes:
<h3>What Is Medicare Open Enrollment?</h3>
Also referred to as the annual coordinated election period or the annual election period (AEP), open enrollment lets Medicare enrollees reevaluate and change their coverage.
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>When Is Medicare Open Enrollment?</h3>
Open enrollment for 2020 coverage began on October 15th and runs until December 7, 2019. Any changes made during the period will become effective on January 1, 2020.
<h3>What Types of Changes Can You Make During the Open Enrollment Period?</h3>
Open enrollment is quite flexible in terms of adjusting your coverage. Here are some examples of the moves you can make to fit your budget and medical needs better:
<ul>
 	<li>You can change from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage.</li>
 	<li>You can change from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare.</li>
 	<li>You can change from one Medicare Advantage plan to another.</li>
 	<li>You can enroll in Medicare Part D (you may be subject to a late enrollment penalty during this period)</li>
 	<li>You can change from one Medicare Part D plan to another.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Signing up for Medicare Advantage During Open Enrollment</h3>
If you’ve been contemplating switching to a Medicare Advantage plan, keep in mind that you will have to meet specific requirements.

First, you will need to live in the service area that corresponds to the plan. Second, you will need to be enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. Last, but not least, you cannot have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). If you do, you will be eligible for Medicare Advantage in 2021, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act.
<h3>Are Changes Mandatory During Medicare Open Enrollment?</h3>
You do not have to make changes to your plan during the open enrollment period.

For instance, you may be satisfied with your current Medicare Advantage or Part D prescription plan, or you may not have the time or desire to research options. As long as your current plan will continue to be available in 2020, it will renew automatically. If not, your carrier should have sent a non-renewal notice before open enrollment.
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>The Benefits of Making Changes During Open Enrollment</h3>
Medicare plan premiums and benefits can change from one year to another. If you choose to ignore the open enrollment period, you could see differences in your 2020 plan that are more costly while providing less coverage. For this reason, it’s a good idea to look your plan over, see that it suits your needs, and see if there are better options on the market.

Are you taking different prescriptions now than you used to? A different Part D plan may be in order. Are your providers still in-network for your Medicare Advantage plan? They can also change each year, and failing to check could leave you seeing a different doctor in 2020.

Even if you decide to make no changes to your plans for the coming year, use open enrollment to double-check that your costs and coverage are ideal before December 7th arrives.

3170,"How To Buy A Home With Bad Credit","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<b>Why Bad Credit Hurts Your Chance of Getting a Mortgage</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lenders are in business to make money. When they loan money, they expect it to be paid back on time. In exchange, they charge interest for assuming that risk.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If a borrower defaults on a loan, it can negatively impact a lender’s bottom line, which is why they must assess risk when lending.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since mortgages are large loans that often equal hundreds of thousands of dollars, lenders have to be particularly careful. Borrowers who present a high risk of being unable to pay loans can significantly damage business. What does this often result in? The rejection of loan applications from borrowers with bad credit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What exactly is “bad credit”? That depends on the situation, but some say that even having a score below 640 could be enough to result in rejection for a home loan.</span>
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several factors go into a credit score, such as:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Payment history</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unused credit</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Income</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Debt load</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Defaults</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bankruptcy</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While you may be stable in one area, another may be keeping your credit score low. Depending on the severity of the issue, you could be looking at years before making your credit score presentable to home lenders.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does this mean rent is your only option for the foreseeable future? Not at all, as long as you use one of these options for buying a house with bad credit.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3><b>Get a private loan or a cosigner</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting rejected for a home loan from a bank, credit union, or other commercial lenders can be a tough pill to swallow. It may not be your only way of getting that loan, however.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may have family who could help with the cash you need to have a larger down payment at least. The bigger the down payment, the less you’ll have to borrow from an official lender. The less you borrow, the less risk you present, and the more likely you are to get the loan.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, asking for a loan from friends or family can be uncomfortable or awkward. Think it through before making the move, and make sure you’ll be able to pay them back according to an agreed-upon schedule.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When asking for a private loan, you may also want to ask if they will be willing to cosign for you. Provided the person has a reliable income and good credit, this could help you secure the mortgage. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having a cosigner does involve risk, though, if you do not make payments on time. You will have to convince them that you will not leave them on the hook for the loan in case of an emergency, which could be a tough task.</span>
<h3><b>Start saving</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If a private loan for a larger down payment is not on the table, start saving your own money to achieve that goal.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look at your monthly expenses. Chances are, you have several that could be reduced, especially when it comes to entertainment or dining.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you have an extra car that’s collecting dust? Sell it for cash that can be used for the home’s down payment. You could also sell used items online or increase your income via a raise, a second job, or side gigs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your goal should be to have a down payment that’s equal to 20% of the purchase price of the home. Doing so will increase your chances of loan approval. In addition, you can get lower monthly payments since putting that much down can eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance.</span>
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Apply for an FHA mortgage</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers mortgages to people with less than ideal credit. For example, you could get an FHA loan if you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make a down payment of 3.5 percent of the home’s total value and have a credit score over 580</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make a down payment of 10 percent of the home’s total value and have a credit score below 580</span></li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, some recent changes to the tool have sparked complaints, especially since there’s not a ton of time to research options before the December 7th deadline. To get you up to speed, we’ll take a look at some of the changes and offer tips on how to make the most out of the Plan Finder’s features.</span>
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<b>Changes to the Medicare Plan Finder</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The modernized Plan Finder was released to online users a couple of months ago. It was the first time it had seen a significant redesign in nearly 10 years. Here are some of the features you can enjoy via the revamped site:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Compare coverage on tablets and smartphones.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">View plan benefits and costs, plus which Medicare Advantage plans come with extra benefits.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">View up to three Medicare Advantage or drug plans side-by-side for quick and easy comparison shopping.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Find optimal Medicare Part D coverage by building a personal drug list.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Compare prices among Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Medigap plans.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These options can surely make it easier to find the coverage you need. Some groups in charge of Medical counseling, however, fear that the changes could cause issues for some users. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To avoid those issues, don’t wait until it’s close to the December 7th deadline to try the Plan Finder. Start using it now to get acquainted with the system and secure the coverage you need.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most significant drawbacks to the Plan Finder’s redesign focuses on prescriptions. The old version allowed users to save their prescription lists via password protection, but that data has not carried over to the newest edition. In other words, you may have to enter your medication information once again.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have </span><a href=""https://www.mymedicare.gov/helppages/securityprivacy/securesignin/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a MyMedicare online account</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, you can use it to sync your prescription drug information to the Plan Finder. If not, creating a My Medicare account for this feature may be worth your time. Once all of the details have synced, be sure to double-check them in the Plan Finder for accuracy.</span>

<b>Tips for Using the Plan Finder</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Plan Finder may take some getting used to, but once you visit the site, most of it should be self-explanatory.</span>
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can log into your old account, create a new one, or shop for options without logging in. If it’s your first time, you’ll be asked to enter information on various topics, such as:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What type of 2020 coverage you seek</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your ZIP code</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Current programs you’re enrolled in, such as Medicaid</span></li>

</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once your data is entered, the system will reveal which plans fit your criteria.

The annual open enrollment period gives you the power to change your Medicare health or drug coverage to better suit your needs. Unfortunately, many online and offline con artists use this to their advantage.

Here are some red flags you should look for, plus tips to stay protected:
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Ways Medicare Con Artists Try to Trick You</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Someone states you have a pending refund from last year’s plan premiums or drug costs.</li>
 	<li>You get a call touting new coverage that comes with huge discounts.</li>
 	<li>You get a call offering a new health card in exchange for a fee.</li>
 	<li>A person tries signing you up to a plan that doesn’t exist.</li>
 	<li>An agent contacts you offering gifts in exchange for enrolling in their plan.</li>
 	<li>An agent uses time limits to pressure you into enrollment.</li>
 	<li>An agent tries to sell you a plan that doesn’t match your needs.</li>
 	<li>A person offers information on a plan, but requests personal data such as your Social Security number, Medicare number, or financial information first.</li>
</ul>
What can happen if you give a scammer your personal information? They can use it to put you in a plan without your permission. That’s why it’s best to only work with a trusted, reputable agent or company.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>What Health Insurance Agents Cannot Do</h3>
Health insurance agents have a specific set of rules they must abide by. They cannot do any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Approach a beneficiary in public. A beneficiary must approach the agent in a health care setting or at a public event.</li>
 	<li>Conduct sales or marketing activities in hospital patient rooms, exam rooms, pharmacy counter areas, or dialysis centers. Such activities must be conducted in common areas.</li>
 	<li>Use the term “Medicare” misleadingly, including stating that they are ""from Medicare.""</li>
 	<li>Leave voicemail messages or send text messages that are unsolicited. They must have documented permission to do so via prior contact with a beneficiary from a sales or marketing event.</li>
</ul>
If an agent or broker is breaking any of those rules, they may be trying to scam you.
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Tips to Prevent Medicare Open Enrollment Fraud</h3>
Besides being aware of the red flags and other issues above, follow these tips to prevent Medicare fraud during open enrollment and beyond:
<ul>
 	<li>Do not give out your Medicare number to anyone besides your doctor or other providers.</li>
 	<li>Do not give out your personal information to anyone requesting it over the phone, unless it’s a company you know and trust.</li>
 	<li>Take your time in making decisions regarding your Medicare coverage during open enrollment. If someone is trying to pressure you, they probably don't have your best interests at heart.</li>
 	<li>Know that Medicare communicates via mail. Health care plans are not allowed to cold call.</li>

3173,"Should You Get A Holiday Loan?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

How can a holiday loan help you end the year with a bang? What can you use it for? We’ll answer those questions and more in this quick guide.
<h3>What Is a Holiday Loan?</h3>
A holiday loan is a type of personal loan that has a relatively short term. It is often issued by a credit union or commercial bank and can range from approximately $500 to $5,000.

Unlike cash advance loans or payday loans, holiday loans do not have extremely high interest rates. Since they are not secured by collateral, however, they may carry higher interest than loans secured by assets.

You can pay a holiday loan in monthly installments, and it usually has a fixed interest rate that does not fluctuate during the life of the loan.

If you do not pay the loan back, your debt could be sent to collections. You could also be hit with a lawsuit and have your wages garnished.
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>What Can You Use a Holiday Loan For?</h3>
Although its name suggests you can only use it for this particular time of year, a holiday loan can isn’t too strict in terms of usage. You usually get it during the holidays, but it can be used for other times when needed.

Here are some ways in which you can use a holiday loan:
<ul>
 	<li>To buy gifts</li>
 	<li>To pay for a family trip</li>
 	<li>As a wedding gift</li>

As you can see, holiday loans are quite flexible, which can make them an attractive option if you are in the market for one.
<h3>Types of Holiday Loans</h3>
Here are some examples of the most commonly used holiday loans:
<h4>Personal loan</h4>
You’ll need a good to excellent credit score for this type of loan since it’s unsecured and carries more risk for the lender. Commercial banks or credit unions have personal loans with fixed interest rates and terms between one to five years.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Personal credit line</h4>
Excellent credit is often required for a personal credit line from a financial institution. This type of unsecured holiday loan can come in handy for an ongoing project since it has no end date.

When you get a personal line of credit, you take out funds as you need them. Repay the principal, and you can keep using those funds.

Interest rates are a little higher than personal loans here.
<h4>Peer-to-peer loan (P2P)</h4>
A P2P loan is like a personal loan, only you get it from investors or individuals via an online platform. If your credit is less than perfect, this newer form of lending may satisfy your holiday loan needs.

P2P loans may have higher interest rates than personal loans from banks, but you may also get a longer term.

An origination fee of one to five percent of the loan’s principal is sometimes required.
[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>Credit card</h4>
If you use a credit card for a holiday loan, you’ll probably pay higher interest than the options above. As long as you can pay off the charges when the first month ends, you should be fine.

Regardless of which holiday loan option you use, only apply for what you need. Getting a larger loan just because you can could lead to financial trouble down the line.","Are you looking for a helping hand to make this holiday season a memorable one?

3174,"Should You Apply For Habitat For Humanity Housing?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

All you want to do is ensure that your family has a decent roof over its head. You don’t want to break the bank in the process of providing that roof, however.

Here’s where Habitat for Humanity housing can come in handy. And if you’re looking for any of the following traits from your home or they apply to your case, it’s time to give this program a closer look.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Your income isn’t too high nor too low</h3>
To qualify for Habitat for Humanity housing, you’ll need a steady income in most cases. This is so you can pay the mortgage on that home, as it will not be given to you for free.

Although a steady income is needed, it can’t be too low nor too high. In other words, if you are working but cannot afford that dream home mortgage, a Habitat home could be just what the doctor ordered.

Since Habitat homes and their eligibility requirements are handled on a local basis, go here to find out the specific income ranges for your area.
<h3>2. You want a house that’s sufficient, not extravagant</h3>
Are you tired of real estate agents and new homebuilders overselling you? If you’re not in the market for more of a home than you can afford, Habitat for Humanity housing may fit your needs perfectly.

Habitat homes are created with low costs and efficiency in mind. By having a home that’s of adequate size, you can keep monthly utility and maintenance costs low.

In doing so, you can meet your monthly mortgage payments with less stress.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. You want an affordable mortgage</h3>
Having a home is nice, but that’s only if you can make the payments on it to build your credit and keep living there.

Mortgages for Habitat homes are lower than standard ones since construction costs are often more affordable. In addition, their mortgages are interest-free.

Combine those savings, and you can save a ton on monthly payments plus the overall cost of your home.

Depending on where you live, you could have a new home with a mortgage as low as $500. As for the down payment, that also varies by location, but you could qualify by just putting $500 down.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>4. You want to build equity in your home – fast</h3>
Since Habitat for Humanity housing is constructed at such low costs, you could gain instant equity as soon as you move in.

For example, let’s say your Habitat home in Virginia costs only $100,000 to build. As soon as it goes on the market, you could be looking at a home worth $200,000, giving you instant $100,000 in equity.

Can you cash in on this equity immediately? That’s doubtful, as each Habitat affiliate has its own rules.

Still, it’s nice to know that such an affordable home can make your financial future look much more favorable.

[the_ad id=""724""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>5. You want more than a home – you want to feel like you’re part of a community</h3>
If you’re eligible for Habitat for Humanity housing, you will be expected to help build your home with other volunteers.

This “sweat equity” is a staple of the program, and it’s what helps communities come together globally to help families move into safe, affordable homes.

By helping to build your home with your own two hands, you’ll feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. You’ll also feel closer to those who helped you do it.","Habitat for Humanity is a source that’s often overlooked when it comes to buying a new home.

3175,"Why Missing Black Friday Is No Big Deal","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Black Friday is a day that offers many buyers these two things: Deals and debt. Sure, you can save some bucks on a big TV you probably don’t need, but buying it on credit could put you into an unnecessary financial hole.

Why do so many people shop on Black Friday? Some do it to save money. Others do it for fear of missing out, which is probably the biggest reason why the post-Thanksgiving shopping bonanza generates so much commerce.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you missed Black Friday because you weren’t “feeling the fever,” didn’t have enough to spend, or were too busy to participate, don’t worry. We’ll discuss why missing out could be a good thing, and how you can still find deals later on.
<h3>You Automatically Saved by Not Spending</h3>
Whether it’s at the mall or online, many Black Friday shoppers tend to go crazy with impulse purchases. They see items with huge markdowns and buy them just because they don’t want to live with the guilt of letting a great deal go to waste.

What does this result in? Racking up tons of debt to collect unnecessary items. And it can also lead to a ton of buyer’s remorse that can make you wish you didn’t participate in the shopping holiday.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

By not doing Black Friday, you got the best deal of all: No debt. You strayed from the FOMO (fear of missing out) curse and all the impulse buying that comes with it.

In short, you saved more than any Black Friday shopper could by not spending a penny.
<h3>Deals Still Exist After Black Friday</h3>
While retailers may make their biggest push on Black Friday, there are still deals to be had during the rest of the holiday season and even year-round.

In fact, some people find that acting quickly on a Black Friday deal backfired. Why? Because they could have bought the same item days later for cheaper.

Thanks to the Internet, you can easily find the lowest price and new deals for an item you want. There’s no need to stress over missing a one-day sale, because you can quickly pinpoint another one that could be even better.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Online Shopping Makes It so Easy to Save</h3>
In continuing with the shopping benefits of the Internet, there are plenty of sites and apps that help you get the most bang for your buck. Best of all, they work 365 days a year, making Black Friday obsolete in some instances.

You could do manual online searches for coupon and promo codes, but with so many apps and extensions that will do it for you, why bother?

Whether it’s finding the lowest price, giving you cash back for purchases, scouring the Net for coupons that actually work, or alerting you of hot deals, apps are your bank account’s best friend. And they’ll make you realize that missing out on Black Friday was somewhat of a blessing.

[the_ad id=""724""]<!-- Media.net -->

As for which apps you can use to save all year long, here’s a quick list of some of the best:
<ul>
 	<li>Honey</li>
 	<li>Rakuten</li>
 	<li>ShopSavvy</li>

3176,"Examples Of Black Friday Gone Wrong","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Want to find the top deals on the following products? Read carefully, as they usually aren’t on Black Friday:
<h3>Winter Coats</h3>
That cold winter air can make a coat necessary if you live up north. But is Black Friday the best time to buy a winter coat? Not really.

The low temperatures that the end of November can bring increases the demand for winter coats. For this reason, retailers prefer to keep their prices higher.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

When can you get a beautiful winter coat without breaking the bank? January, as that’s when the winter season for retail starts coming to a close.

If you can stick it out until a little after the new year, you should find some quality coats on clearance racks at a fraction of their regular price.
<h3>Fitness Equipment</h3>
A bargain on an exercise bike could surely come in handy on Black Friday. After all, you’ll probably want something to help you fill your new year’s resolution if it involves some sort of fitness goal.

Is Black Friday best for bikes and other fitness equipment, though? You probably could score some savings, but if you see nothing you like, don’t fret.

January is best for finding fitness equipment at affordable prices since it coincides with those new year’s resolutions. Wait it out, then pick out the piece of equipment that best fits your needs.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Holiday Decorations</h3>
As the Thanksgiving decorations go into storage and the Christmas ones come out, you may want to add to your collection.

Unfortunately, the high demand for holiday decorations around Black Friday leads to fewer discounts. You can snag some new items once the holidays are over, however, and use them the next time around.
<h3>Chocolate</h3>
This sweet treat makes a great stocking stuffer in boxes, but its best bargains often aren’t found on Black Friday.

If you want to find the best boxed chocolate discounts, keep your eyes peeled in between Valentine’s Day and Easter. While those dates may be months away, you can stock up, just as with holiday decorations, and use those chocolates as gifts later on.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Tools</h3>
Could your home use some new tools to keep handy for when unexpected repairs are needed? Home improvement stores may offer some tool-related discounts on Black Friday, but there’s no need to pull the trigger so soon.

The days after Black Friday are better for tool buying, so whether they’re for projects around the home or a gift for that special someone, be patient in this department.
<h3>Laptops</h3>
Electronics are trendy purchases on Black Friday. If you need evidence of that, just look at the long lines anxious customers outside of Best Buy that start forming on Thanksgiving.

What’s one of the most highly desired electronics during the holidays? Laptops, as many people use them for work, school, and entertainment.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

3178,"Ways To Rebuild Your Bank Account After A Costly Vacation","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You could be soaking up the sun on an exotic beach without a care in the world. Once you get home, however, stress could pile up as you wonder how you’ll pay the bills.

Whether you just had a vacation that emptied your wallet or have one on the horizon, here are ways to replenish your savings once it’s all said and done.

By knowing how to stack cash quicker, you’ll be able to enjoy your future vacations without feeling so frustrated over your finances.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Try a no-spend challenge.</h3>
Almost every vacation can seem like a spending spree as you fork over cash for:
<ul>
 	<li>Airfare</li>
 	<li>Cruises</li>
 	<li>Rental cars</li>
 	<li>Hotels</li>
 	<li>Food</li>
 	<li>Entertainment</li>
 	<li>Souvenirs</li>
 	<li>And more…</li>
</ul>
What’s the best way to counteract all of that seemingly non-stop spending? By cutting your spending as soon as the vacation is finished.

A no-spend challenge can help you achieve this goal, and there are many ways to try it. For example, you could make it a goal to cut online spending entirely for a full month after your vacation. This means no Amazon purchases and the like.

Since you were just enjoying outings probably every single day, you could pledge to avoid spending on eating out and other forms of entertainment for a month too.

Regardless of how you format your no-spend challenge, instituting some form of saving will help you rebuild your depleted bank account.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>2. Make a strict budget.</h3>
One of the best ways to save and see where your money really goes is to make a budget and stick to it. By having such a plan in place, you’ll avoid impulse purchases that can pack a wallop on your wallet.
<h3>3. Use only cash for a month.</h3>
It’s easy to lose control over your spending via credit and debit cards. By sticking to a cash-only system, you’ll have to be more picky about your purchases to ensure you can buy all of your necessities.

Make your budget for the post-vacation month and get enough cash to cover it. Keep it in an envelope, knowing that will be your only form of payment for the month. By limiting yourself in this way, you’ll automatically instill financial discipline that will help you cut spending.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>4. Use direct deposits and automatic transfers.</h3>
The less accessible your cash is, the better. You can make it harder to access by setting up a direct deposit that will move a portion of your paycheck into your savings account. You can do the same by creating an automatic transfer from your checking to your savings once payday hits.
<h3>5. Eat what you have.</h3>
What do most people do as soon as they get home from vacation? They hit the grocery store to start spending once again.

You can avoid this by trying some form of the pantry challenge. As its name suggests, you use whatever you already have and make meals out of it.

You’ll probably have to be creative here, but by using what’s in your kitchen, you’ll be able to save while slowly eliminating clutter as well.","A vacation’s costs can make it hard to enjoy fully.

<h3>National Diaper Bank Network</h3>
This organization’s homepage stresses the importance of babies having clean diapers. Without them, they’re less likely to be admitted to daycares, making it hard for parents to work and put food on the table. Also, a lack of clean diapers can make a baby more susceptible to health risks.

Taking these issues into account, the National Diaper Bank Network aims to help by offering free diapers to families in need. You can go here to see if they serve your community. If not, the Network suggests dialing 211 on your phone to see if there’s an agency near you that offers diaper assistance.

Last, but not least, look for food pantries in your city or faith-based organizations. They sometimes provide free diapers to local families that need them.

<h3>Share the Love</h3>
This nonprofit program knows just how much of a chunk diapers can take out of a parent’s budget. That’s why they came up with Share the Love to distribute free cloth diapers to low-income families.

While getting free baby stuff in the form of diapers is nice, the fact that they’re of the cloth variety is even better. You can wash and reuse cloth diapers, which can lead to significant monthly savings.

To give you an idea of how huge of an expense diapers can be, look no further than this page on the Share the Love website. It lists various statistics on the cost of diapers, such as this one:

According to Babies R Us, the average child goes through 3,360 diapers in their first year. By using cloth, you can significantly cut into that amount to stretch your income farther.
<h3>The Cloth Option</h3>
You can get even more free cloth diapers by going to The Cloth Option’s site and applying for assistance.

3180,"Should You Pay for Insurance When Renting a Car?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Maybe you’re taking a long trip, and don’t want to put miles on your car for the multiple-hour commute. Or perhaps your vehicle is out of commission, and you need temporary transportation to replace it. Regardless of why you need one, a rental car can give you the means to get from A to B.

On the surface, many rental cars seem affordable. Their daily rates may even seem downright cheap. But as you look closer and it comes time to reserve one, that daily fee can increase in a second. Why? Blame it on car insurance.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

Purchasing car insurance for your own automobile seems like a sound move. You do want to protect your investment should you get in an accident, after all. Buying insurance for a car that isn’t yours, however, could seem like money wasted, which brings up this question: Do you really need it?

The truth is, buying coverage for a rental car is up to you. There’s no right or wrong answer, as it depends on your situation, budget, and personal preference.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Does Your Personal Policy Cover Rental Cars?</h3>
If you have a car, your personal auto insurance policy may cover the rental. You’ll have to check with your provider to see if this is the case.
If so, you can save money by declining the rental car company’s insurance and sticking with your own.

What’s the downside to this? The fact that your policy’s deductible is likely to carry over. In other words, if you get in an accident while driving the rental car, you’ll have to pay the deductible for property that isn’t even yours.

As an example, let’s say you have a fender bender that results in $5,000 in damage. Since you used your personal policy on the rental, a deductible of $1,000 applies. You’ll have to pay this amount before the coverage kicks in, causing a substantial dent to your wallet.

<h3>The Main Benefit of Rental Car Insurance</h3>
Purchasing car insurance from the rental company avoids the issue of costly deductibles from your existing policy. It will add to your current expenses, though, and could be considered a waste of money if no incidents occur while driving.

What’s the benefit of purchasing rental car insurance? The peace of mind you get knowing you’re protected. To some, that may be worth the extra cost.
<h3>How to Get Your Credit Card to Pay for Rental Insurance</h3>
If you have a credit card, using it to pay for your rental car may give you coverage. You’ll have to check with your credit card company, but many do offer this bonus.

Before breathing a sigh of relief, know that rental car insurance coverage from a credit card may not be comprehensive. It could cover things like damage to the car, theft, or towing, but it may not cover liability.

When renting a car, your best bet is to check the fine print. Whether it’s from your auto insurance agency, the rental company, or your credit card, ask for all the details before making your final choice.","When renting a car, should you pay for insurance?

You may feel distraught if you can’t put a roof over your family’s head. Worrying about the situation won’t improve it, however. Instead, you have to tackle it head-on, which is what we’ll teach you to do today.

Even though it may seem that everything’s going against you, there are ways to find apartments for homeless families that can save the day. Here they are:

<h3>Get Long-Term Assistance via Housing Choice Vouchers</h3>
It may not be the quickest way to find apartments for homeless people, but Housing Choice Vouchers are an excellent option for long-term assistance.

If you find that you cannot meet your monthly expenses no matter how hard you try, a voucher (previously Section 8) can give you that longer-term assistance you need.

What’s the downside to applying for a voucher? The fact that the process often carries long wait times. Depending on your location, you could be waiting months or years to get the housing assistance you need, making it not so ideal if you’re homeless.

Does this mean you should discount Housing Choice Vouchers altogether? Not at all. It just means that you should apply for them as a long-term solution, and apply for other quicker forms of assistance in the meantime.

It’s worth noting that being homeless can accelerate the process of securing a Housing Choice Voucher. Mention it on your application, and your wait may not be as long.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>How Your State or City Can Help You Find Apartments for Homeless Families</h3>
While the HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher program offers long-term rental assistance nationwide, your best bet may be seeking help from your city or state.

Many cities and states help people find homes if they’re homeless or threatened with eviction. To see if you’re eligible, contact your state or local housing agency.

When talking to your local housing counselor, stress the fact that you are homeless. On average, help on this level can take a couple of weeks to come through. Being homeless may shorten that wait time, though.

If you do get help through this avenue, remember that it is only temporary. That’s why it’s a good idea to apply for a Housing Choice Voucher to fill the gaps once local help runs out.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Find Charities and Nonprofit Organizations That Offer Apartments for Homeless Families</h3>
A HUD local housing counselor may know of local charities and nonprofits that can put you into a home. If not, you can dial 2-1-1 to get a list of contacts that may be able to help.

A benefit of working with charities or nonprofits is that some do not require you to be a U.S. citizen to apply. There’s also the benefit of shorter wait times to find housing, as compared to vouchers.

Examples of additional groups that can help include The Homeless Families Foundation in Ohio, The Continuum of Care (CoC), and the National Coalition for the Homeless.

Visit any one of those sites to see the types of resources that are available, and you could end your homeless struggles soon.","Is your family currently without a home?

3182,"How To Start Building Your Emergency Fund With Just One Penny","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you have no funds stashed away for a rainy day, your financial future may become quite stormy should something unfortunate happen.

Does this mean you should panic if your rainy day fund is currently nonexistent? Not necessarily, as we’ll discuss a way to start putting funds to it, even if you lack much disposable income to do so.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>The Importance of an Emergency Fund</h3>
Why is an emergency fund so important? First, it gives you some financial help to lean on if something happens like an accident, the need for an expensive car or home repair, or another unexpected expense pops up.

Second, it keeps you from charging that expense to a credit card or taking out a loan, which can put you in debt for weeks, months, or even years to come.
<h3>How Much Money Should You Have in Your Emergency Fund?</h3>
The numbers vary according to your lifestyle, family size, and needs, but most say you should have three to six months of living expenses saved in your emergency fund.

While the amount is essential, so is how you keep it. You want that rainy day money to be accessible, but not so available you can dip into it and spend it on something else.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>How to Create Your Emergency Fund Today</h3>
You want to get into the act of saving so you can start building that emergency fund now. As with many things, it may be a good idea to start small so that you can gain some momentum.

What’s an excellent way to start small? Start saving via the Penny Challenge.

When it comes to currency, you don’t get much smaller than a penny. Luckily, a penny is all you need to start this simple, yet effective challenge that will slowly add money to your emergency fund.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How to Start the Penny Challenge</h3>
You can begin the Penny Challenge today by putting one single penny in a piggy bank. To continue it tomorrow, add two pennies to the piggy bank. On the third day, add three. Continue this for 365 days, and you will have completed the Penny Challenge.

How much money can you add to your emergency fund after doing one year of the Penny Challenge? $667.95 is the total. And while that may not seem like much for doing a year’s worth of saving, remember how little you’re putting into the pot.

The highest deposit you’ll make is $3.65 on the final day of the challenge. So, for about the cost of two candy bars, you can get into the act of saving, build financial discipline, and have a nice sum at the end of one year that can be used for emergencies.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

If the thought of making small cash deposits daily to a piggy bank sounds too taxing, make weekly deposits from your checking to savings account instead.

If you choose this weekly route, however, make sure you stick to it. By not making daily deposits, it’s easier to forget that you’re an active participant in the challenge.

Want to build your emergency fund faster? Do the Penny Challenge with multiple members of your family. It’s still highly doable, and you can double, triple, or even quadruple your emergency fund in the next 12 months.","Do you have zero money saved in your emergency fund? Here’s how to change that starting today.","2020-01-24 16:26:20",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-start-building-your-emergency-fund-with-just-one-penny/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1200348475.jpg,shutterstock_1200348475.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1200348475.jpg,3004,shutterstock_1200348475,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1200348475.jpg,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-start-building-your-emergency-fund-with-just-one-penny,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:25"
3183,"Where Low-Income Families Can Find Security Deposit Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

A security deposit can be a huge obstacle for anyone looking to move into a new home. For a low-income family, however, it can make the process of moving into a safer, more affordable neighborhood nearly impossible.

While there may not be a ton of funding for it, some security deposit assistance programs do exist. We’ll discuss them now, so you can start securing that upfront cash you need soon.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>1. Community action agencies</h3>
These local non-profit organizations exist from coast to coast and offer a helping hand to residents in various ways, including security deposit assistance.

Community action agencies receive funds and donations from a variety of sources, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>The federal government</li>
 	<li>Faith-based organizations</li>
 	<li>The United Way</li>
 	<li>Corporations</li>
</ul>
They then take those funds and disburse them to county residents, with an emphasis on helping low-income families in need.

While you could turn to your local community action agency for help with paying your security deposit, it could also help you with securing housing, paying rent, or getting off the streets if you’re homeless.

To find your nearest ""community action agency,"" do an online search for that three-word phrase plus the city or county in which you live in.

If they say they do not provide security deposit assistance, ask for a referral so they can point you in the right direction.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>2. Federal programs</h3>
You may be able to find funding for your security deposit through the federal government if you are on the verge of being evicted or are already homeless.

Two programs that may offer security deposit assistance include the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program and the Continuum of Care (CoC).

Security deposit resources from these programs, if available, will likely be minimal. If you are facing eviction or are homeless, be sure to mention that when contacting either program, as it could help you find help faster.

Local non-profit agencies disburse federal funds to those who qualify. Note that many states will only pay a portion of your security deposit, and you’ll be expected to come up with the rest.

Keep in mind that if you can prove you’ve been working and doing your best to become self-sufficient, you may have a better chance of being eligible for assistance.

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>3. Salvation Army</h3>
Your local Salvation Army branch may offer security deposit assistance. As with other programs, expect funding to be extremely limited and reserved for those truly in need.

For example, if you’re moving from transitional housing or shelter to a new home, you may be at the front of the line when it comes to receiving security deposit help.
<h3>4. Other charities</h3>
Local churches or charities may also lend a helping hand with paying your security deposit, so be sure to look and ask around to see if such a program exists.

On a national basis, you can visit the Catholic Charities or Society of St. Vincent de Paul websites to see if they provide security deposit assistance near you.","Are you unable to move to your new home due to a hefty security deposit?

<h3>What Is the Purpose of the Housing Choice Voucher Program?</h3>
The Housing Choice Voucher Program, which is more commonly known by its old “Section 8” name, was put together with the goal of helping low-income families live in safer homes and neighborhoods. It does this by providing part of their rent so they can meet their monthly expenses.

While the benefits of Section 8 vouchers are obvious for families since they can improve their well-being and quality of life, they can also help the government. The more Section 8 helps families become self-sustainable, the less they’ll have to rely on other government programs.

Since vouchers are limited, local public housing agencies (PHAs) must be selective in who they award benefits to. To achieve this goal, they use a variety of factors to determine eligibility and need, such as family size and household income.

Once a family becomes eligible for a Housing Choice Voucher and receives it, they can seek housing to meet their needs. As long as the house meets the program’s standards, they can move in and start to enjoy their home.

<a name=""Eligible""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How Does a PHA Determine If a Family Is Eligible for a Section 8 Voucher?</h3>
As much as you may want to move your family into a better home now, you should first know what PHAs look for when determining eligibility. In doing so, you’ll see if you have a decent chance of getting accepted into the program, so you don’t waste your time applying and waiting.

Since the approval process for Section 8 can take months after you submit your application, the last thing you want to do is wait for something dead from the start. For this reason, let’s look a the four main criteria PHAs use to see if you’re eligible for a voucher:
<h4>1. The size of your family.</h4>
If your family situation is a bit complicated and doesn’t follow the norm, don’t worry. The government has various definitions of what qualifies as a family. As long as yours sits in one of these categories, you should be good to go:
<ul>
 	<li>A family with or without children – Do you have children that do not live at home with you? If they’re in foster care or outside of the house, you could still qualify as a family.</li>
 	<li>Elderly family – Is the head of household or single family member over 62 years old? Are two members of the family over 62? Is one over 62 and residing with a live-in aide? Any of these qualifies you as being part of an elderly family.</li>
 	<li>Disabled family – Does the single family member or head of household have disabilities? Do two more family members have disabilities? Does one person have disabilities and live with an aide? Any of these qualifies you as part of a disabled family.</li>
 	<li>Displaced family – Can you no longer live in your home due to destruction or damage caused by a natural disaster? Has government action removed you from your home? Either place you in the displaced family category.</li>
 	<li>Remaining member of a tenant family – Only one person of a family receiving voucher assistance has to remain in the home to qualify under this category.
Single person – If you don’t fit into any of the categories above, you can still qualify as a family via the single person label.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Your family’s income.</h4>
The government created the Housing Choice Voucher program with low-income families in mind. As such, income limits play a massive part in the approval process. If your family’s income is too high, you may not be eligible for Section 8 benefits.

One thing that may be in your favor is family size. The bigger your family, the more income is allowed. Since a family can have up to eight members, you could still enjoy a higher overall income while qualifying for Section 8.

Besides your family size, income limits also vary depending on where you live. And once a PHA determines what all of your family members make, it will use that to place your family into one of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Low income</li>
 	<li>Very low income</li>
 	<li>Extra low income</li>
</ul>
What’s the general standard for income eligibility? Your family will need to earn less than half of the median income for your area. What’s the purpose of those three income tiers? To give the PHA a guide as to who needs vouchers most.

By law, PHAs must give three out of every four of their housing vouchers to families in the lowest income category. If you find that you fall into that category, you can be a bit more optimistic about your chances of getting a voucher than someone with a higher income.

Since vouchers are so limited, falling into the lowest income category becomes a crucial factor in determining who gets Section 8 benefits.

To qualify for the extremely low-income category, you’ll need to make less than 30 percent of the poverty line or the local median income, whichever is higher.

Again, don’t stress if you feel like your income is too high for a voucher. If you have several family members, that will allow for higher pay since there are more mouths to feed.

Income limits not only vary due to where you live, as they can also vary due to the year. Since they can change often, you’ll want to keep an eye on the limits for your area before applying for Section 8.

You can see income limits for your area and family size by going here.

The PDF will illustrate how more family members allow for higher overall income. The acceptable income for a one-person family is much different than that of an eight-person family. You can also see the three income tiers to get a clearer idea of where your family stands.
<h4>3. The citizenship status of your family members.</h4>
The Housing Choice Voucher Program is reserved for citizens and permanent residents of the United States. If your family contains a mix of citizenship statuses under one roof, however, you can still qualify for Section 8.

The voucher value you receive will depend on how many eligible family members you have. In other words, if two members of your family are citizens and the other three aren’t, you can expect to qualify for a voucher that covers just the two eligible people. The other three will not be included in the calculation.

While having a family of mixed citizenship will lower your voucher value, it’s still good to know that those members can still benefit indirectly from a voucher by having a roof over their heads.
<h4>4. Your family’s eviction history.</h4>
Low-income families may be more susceptible to evictions than others due to money issues. Will this keep you from getting Section 8 assistance? Not necessarily, as long as your removals are not related to drugs.

Evictions due to drug-related criminal activity will disqualify you from voucher eligibility for three years. To apply and have any chance at approval, you’ll have to wait three years past the date of that eviction until you can try again.

After looking at these four factors for eligibility, do you think your family can qualify for Section 8? If so, it’s time to look at what the application process looks like so you can begin getting everything in order.

<a name=""Documents""></a>

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>What Documents Will I Need to Apply for a Housing Voucher?</h3>
If you want your Section 8 application to process as smoothly as possible, you’ll need to spend some time gathering documentation and paperwork.

This is an absolute must since your PHA will use those documents to verify income, citizenship status, and other bits of information needed to determine your family’s eligibility.

While gathering up documents for yourself is plenty of work, know that you’ll need documents for every family member if you hope to include them in your application.

The documents you need can be divided into two main sections, with the first covering general identification and citizenship and including:
<ul>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Driver’s license</li>
 	<li>Social Security card</li>
 	<li>Government or state photo ID</li>
 	<li>Passport (for any non-U.S. citizens)</li>
 	<li>Immigration documents</li>
</ul>
The second group of documents you’ll need cover income and include:
<ul>
 	<li>Tax returns, W2 forms</li>
 	<li>Pay stubs or other proof of income</li>
 	<li>Information regarding assets you own</li>
 	<li>Benefit verification letter for Social Security</li>
 	<li>Paperwork showing that you receive any additional public assistance</li>
</ul>
Ask your PHA for an exact list of the documents you’ll need. Even if you’re missing one, it could delay the application process.

Although these documents will play a primary role in determining your Section 8 eligibility, they will also be used to assess your voucher value once you get accepted. The amount of your voucher will give you a better idea of what type of housing you can secure.

As a side note, remember that your documents should all be authentic. The same holds for your answers or information submitted on your application.

Do not change any numbers with the hopes of making your family eligible for Section 8. Your PHA will cross-check the information with local agencies, your bank, and employer to ensure everything is correct.

<h3>How Do I Apply for a Housing Choice Voucher?</h3>
Getting a Housing Choice Voucher can improve the quality of life for your family. By moving to a safer home or neighborhood, your kids can go to better schools, and you may enjoy perks too in terms of convenience, more job options, etc.

For all of these reasons, make it a priority to apply for Section 8 a quickly as you can. The sooner you have that voucher in your hands, the quicker you’ll be able to enjoy all the benefits better housing can bring.

Section 8 vouchers are limited. Combine this with high demand from low-income families, and it’s no wonder why voucher waiting lists can be so long.

Getting approved is just the first part of the process, so to move towards that, follow these steps:
<h4>1. Locate your Public Housing Agency.</h4>
Even though the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is in charge of Section 8 funds, it’s your local PHA that will process your application.

The first step in the Section 8 application process is to locate your PHA, which can be done by going to the HUD’s website.

Click your state on the map, and you will see a list of offices. Keep scrolling until you see yours and write down the information. You’ll be needing it frequently.
<h4>2. Check your family’s eligibility.</h4>
As mentioned, your location, family size, and income limits will play a big part in seeing if you’re eligible for a voucher. Combine those factors with citizenship status and eviction history, and you’ll have the info your PHA needs to know if you have a chance at becoming a Section 8 recipient.

Here’s where you’ll need to have your documentation handy. Without it, your PHA cannot tell if you’re eligible or not.
<h4>3. Get your voucher application.</h4>
There are several ways to get your Housing Choice Voucher Program application. The options available to you vary by location.

Contact your PHA to see what’s your best bet so you can get started. The most common options include getting an application in person, online, or via mail.
<h4>4. Complete the application.</h4>
No matter how much of a rush you may be in to get a voucher, you must take your time when completing your application. You want to ensure all of the information is correct and complete, as well as truthful.

Be prepared to provide standard information on each family member, such as their date of birth, income, phone number, etc. Since a larger family size allows for more pay, try not to skip any members just because you’re missing information.

You’ll probably have some questions when completing the Section 8 application. Since you want the process to be as mistake-free as possible, don’t hesitate to ask your PHA for any clarity.

They’ll know all the details and can give you tips on what’s needed to make your application not only complete, but also so it stands out from the competition.
<h4>5. Apply on time.</h4>
Once you verify that everything in your application is correct, submit it by the due date. Some PHAs have specific due dates, so missing one could result in a significant delay.
<h4>6. Wait for the PHA's decision to accept or reject.</h4>
There will be plenty of waiting involved. After submitting your application, you may have to wait a few months for a response.

The PHA will let you know if your family was accepted or rejected. If approved, you’ll be placed on a waiting list to get a housing voucher.

<h3>How Long Is the Waiting List for Section 8 Vouchers?</h3>
Finding out you’re eligible for Section 8 assistance is excellent news. Approval of your application doesn’t mean you automatically get a voucher, however.

Once approved, you will be put on a waiting list. And since the demand for housing assistance is so high, you can be waiting for several months to put your family into a new home.

Ask your PHA what your options are. You can sometimes apply via more than one PHA near you to up your chances of approval and accelerate the process.

Besides applying to other PHAs, four special situations can move you up the waiting list so you can get your voucher quicker.

If you’re homeless, living in substandard housing, pay more than half your income in rent, or have been displaced due to disaster or the government, you could gain voucher priority. Be sure to tell your housing counselor if any of those apply to your family’s current situation.

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How Much Is a Section 8 Voucher Worth?</h3>
Despite what many think, Section 8 will not pay for all of your rent. You will have to pay 30 percent of your income or a minimum of $50 per month towards utilities and rent, whichever is higher. The voucher will cover the rest of the expenses.

<a name=""Rent""></a>

[the_ad id=""758""]<!-- AdSense -->

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Is There a Cap on Section 8 Rent?</h3>
Your PHA will set a payment standard, which is a cap on rent to ensure the housing you select is moderately priced for the area. If you choose a home that’s more expensive than the payment standard, you will have to pay any difference in the rent.

<a name=""Restrictions""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>What Are the Restrictions When Choosing Section 8 Housing?</h3>
You won’t be limited to subsidized housing projects if you get approved for a voucher. You can live in a single-family home, apartment, or townhome as long as it meets the Housing Choice Voucher Program’s Housing Quality Standards (HQS).

These standards cover a host of factors, such as the neighborhood, cleanliness, water availability, structure, indoor air quality, and more. The PHA will use these factors to determine whether the housing you choose is suitable for voucher use.

Once you feel like you’ve found the perfect Section 8 housing, three things must happen before you can move into the home.

First, the landlord will have to accept Housing Choice Vouchers. Second, the PHA will have to review and confirm that the home satisfies HQS. And third, the PHA will have to verify that the home’s rent is in line with the payment standard.

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How Long Is a Section 8 Lease?</h3>
After the home you choose is accepted for voucher use, you will have to sign a minimum 12-month lease with the landlord. A security deposit may be required that cannot be more than one month’s rent.

After the initial lease ends, the landlord can allow you to live in the home on a month-to-month basis. They can also create a new contract.

<a name=""Responsibilities""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>What Responsibilities Will I Have Once I’m a Section 8 Tenant?</h3>
Once you’re living in your Section 8 home, you will have the following primary responsibilities, among others:
<ul>
 	<li>Pay your rent portion on time.</li>
 	<li>Maintain the home in good condition.</li>
 	<li>Follow the lease agreement.</li>
 	<li>Abide by the Housing Choice Voucher Program’s requirements.</li>
 	<li>Notify the PHA of any changes in family composition or income.</li>
 	<li>Abstain from criminal activity.</li>
</ul>
At the same time, your landlord will have to:
<ul>
 	<li>Follow the lease agreement.</li>
 	<li>Offer the home at a reasonable rent.</li>
 	<li>Receive PHA voucher payments.</li>
 	<li>Keep the home in a condition that meets HQS.</li>
</ul>
The PHA will pay the landlord directly every month. It will also ensure your family meets the program’s standards by reviewing income and composition once a year, plus the home.

As for the HUD, it will disburse federal funds to the PHA for voucher payments, plus ensure that the agency follows guidelines accurately.

<a name=""Benefits""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Will I Lose Section 8 Benefits If I Move?</h3>
If your family has to move, you don’t want to have any gaps in your Section 8 assistance. As long as you’ve lived in the home you first received support in for one year, you should be able to receive vouchers after moving.

If you have any doubts or are contemplating a move, contact your PHA beforehand so they can confirm your continuation of benefits. You will have to end your existing lease with the landlord. You will also have to ensure that the new home passes HQS.

<a name=""Voucher""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Can I Buy a Home With a Section 8 Voucher?</h3>
If you’re looking to buy your first home, the Homeownership Voucher Program can help. Instead of using your voucher towards rent, it can be used towards your mortgage payment.

Restrictions apply, so contact your PHA for more details.

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How Do I Contact the HUD?</h3>
For any questions on the Housing Choice Voucher Program or Section 8 rental assistance, contact the HUD by calling 1-800-955-2232. They can answer your call between 9 am and 5 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.","Do you need help paying the rent so you can enjoy safe, affordable housing for your family?

Retailers go into attack mode when Valentine’s Day rolls around. Since it’s the only romantic holiday on the calendar, they know they can charge a pretty penny for products that are usually much cheaper.

Do only those in relationships spend on Valentine’s Day? No, which is why this article will give money-saving tips for both single people and those who are dating or married.

<h3>Money-Saving Valentine’s Day Tips for Singles</h3>
If you just got out of a relationship or haven’t been in one for a while, you may want to do everything possible to forget that February 14th exists.

What’s the best way to do this? It’s not going to a bar or club and buying expensive drinks as you stare at happy couples and wish you were them. Instead, you can forget Valentine’s Day by doing something productive and inexpensive, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Reorganize your room, closet, or part of your home.</li>
 	<li>Do meal prep so you have something quick and easy you can heat instead of wasting money by ordering or eating out.</li>
 	<li>Go to the gym. You won’t be the only one in there, which can be helpful in itself on this lovers’ holiday.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips to Save on Valentine’s Day for Those in Relationships</h3>
If your budget is so tight you can barely afford a Valentine’s Day gift or dinner, don’t fret. Follow these tips, and you can make it buy even if your bank account is almost empty.
<ul>
 	<li>Use what’s already in your home, such as board games, Netflix, cable TV, etc. to entertain yourselves. What matters is that you’re spending time together, not the activity.</li>
 	<li>Look through old pictures. It’s the best way to relive your past and see how far you’ve come without spending a dime.</li>
 	<li>Talk about your favorite memories from the past. You can do this while looking through pictures to pass the time, appreciate one another, and not spend a thing.</li>
 	<li>Cook together at home instead of heading out to a crowded and overpriced restaurant. You can enjoy each other’s time better while saving money.
Make a coupon book that can be redeemed for things like chores, date nights, and more.</li>
 	<li>Go to where you first fell in love, if it’s nearby.</li>
 	<li>Visit a park, take a walk around the neighborhood, or go to the gym together. Again, what’s important is spending time with one another, not how much you spend.</li>

Money problems won’t fix themselves. Whether your bills are too high or your income is too low, you’ll have to take steps to rectify the issue.

If you’re having trouble paying your bills every month, these are the steps that can get you on the right track.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Trim the fat.</h4>
Like most people, you probably have at least one unnecessary expense that’s bloating your budget. And if you want to know where to look first to find such an expense, analyze what you spend on entertainment.

Are you eating out or ordering delivery frequently? Do you have several subscription services like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, and the like that you could do without?

If so, ditch every such expense that you can to leave more money for the essentials.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Pay the most important bills first.</h4>
There are specific bills that absolutely must be paid every month for you and your family to survive. These include things like electricity, water, rent/mortgage, and insurance. Put them at the top of the list of items to be paid.

Next, list all of your secured debts. These are debts with collateral attached to them, such as home equity loans and auto loans.

Lastly, list your unsecured debts. These get the least priority in terms of being paid since you only have so much money this month for your essentials. Unsecured debts include personal loans, credit card debt, and bills for services.

With your bills listed in tiers, pick out the ones you’ll need money for this month. The others will have to wait, and while your credit may take a hit, at least you’ll keep the lights on.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. Call your creditors.</h4>
Since you’re looking at a long list of bills with little money to pay them, some creditors won’t get paid this month. Instead of keeping this a mystery, call them to let them know your situation.

Do this before the bill’s due date and see if you can get a reduced or deferred payment. You can also ask if they’ll give you a later due date or waive late fees to minimize the damage.

Not only can calling your creditors give you some breathing room when times get tough, but it can also keep your credit score from taking a hit that can affect you in the future.

If you have student loans, you’ll definitely want to make this call to your issuer. They can put a forbearance or deferment on your loan, which can keep you from having to make a payment soon.

The same holds true with medical bills. Call up the company who issues your statements, let them know you’re in a tight spot, and see if you can renegotiate the payments.

Whatever you do, don’t just ignore your bills without making any calls. It will only make your situation more expensive and stressful.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Increase your income</h4>
Sell all the stuff collecting dust around your home via a garage sale or online. Ask for extra hours at your current job. Ask friends and family if you can perform any services for cash so you can pay your bills.

Or you can pick up a side gig like babysitting, pet sitting, or something similar to give you the cash you need to make payments on time.

You’d be surprised at how resourceful you can become if you just sit down, analyze your situation, and make the right moves.","Not being able to pay your bills can be super stressful.

3187,"Have Kids? Use These 6 Tax Breaks This Year","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Taking care of kids can be costly. Luckily, there are several tax credits and deductions you can take advantage of to make more wiggle room in your budget.

<h3>1. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</h3>

The EITC helps people with low to moderate incomes. It reduces how much tax they owe and could even result in a refund.

Your income will have to sit below a certain threshold to be eligible for this tax credit. That threshold will depend on how many children you have and your filing status, such as single, jointly with your spouse, etc.

It’s worth noting that you can be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit if you do not have any children.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>2. Child Tax Credit</h3>
If you have children under the age of 17, you may be eligible for the Child Tax Credit. Eligibility begins as soon as they are born.

Depending on your income, you can get $2,000 for each child under 17.

<h3>3. Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit</h3>

The cost of childcare has gone through the roof. It’s so high that some parents quit work altogether since it makes more financial sense.

If you paid for childcare, you could get some of that reimbursed via your taxes through the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.

As long as your child is under the age of 13 and you were either looking for work or employed, you can get reimbursed for a portion of your childcare expenses.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>4. Pregnancy Expenses</h3>

Did you have a baby last year? First, congratulations! And second, you can get reimbursed for out of pocket medical expenses related to your pregnancy.

If you were never reimbursed for pregnancy expenses, you could itemize them as deductions on your tax return.

The expenses will have to equal at least 10 percent of your adjusted gross income to be eligible. When you consider the cost of pregnancies and the medical care they require, however, reaching that threshold shouldn’t be hard.

<h3>5. Head-of-Household Status</h3>

Filing as head-of-household instead of single can reduce your tax rate. Keep this in mind if you are single but have children.

To qualify for this tax break via head-of-household status, the dependent will have to live with you more than six months per year. You will also have to contribute over half of the household’s financial support. Lastly, you’ll need to be unmarried on December 31.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>6. American Opportunity Tax Credit</h3>

Some parents’ child-related costs extend well past their teenage years. This is especially true if you decide to fund your child’s college education.

While that added cost may put a burden on your budget, you can use the American Opportunity Tax Credit to get some of it back.

This credit lets you claim up to $2,500 for tuition and expenses during your child’s first four years of college.","If you’re a parent, you’re going to want to know which tax breaks can boost your bottom line this year.","2020-02-20 15:56:51",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/have-kids-use-these-6-tax-breaks-this-year/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_560410972.jpg,shutterstock_560410972.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_560410972.jpg,3014,shutterstock_560410972,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_560410972.jpg,"Financial Help","Help for families",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,have-kids-use-these-6-tax-breaks-this-year,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:26"

3189,"8 Common Questions About Habitat For Humanity Housing And Its Eligibility Requirements","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Have you heard about Habitat for Humanity in an ad or seen it on TV? Probably, but you may have some misconceptions about what the program is and what it does.

For example, you may think that they give away homes for free. You may feel that you have to be impoverished or homeless to qualify. And you may also believe that groups of random people show up to build new homes without any real experience or expertise in construction.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

While this quick guide will focus mostly on the eligibility requirements for Habitat for Humanity housing, let’s begin with some frequently asked questions on how the program operates.
<h3>1. What is the primary goal of Habitat for Humanity?</h3>
A quick visit to the home page of Habitat’s official website tells you the program’s primary goal in a nutshell.

It’s a nonprofit organization that strives to:
<ul>
 	<li>Help families build new homes or improve their existing ones.</li>
 	<li>Make safe housing affordable.</li>
 	<li>Create stable communities.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Notice that Habitat for Humanity improves existing homes as well. So if you thought they were only involved in new construction, you now know that they could help you make your current home safer and more efficient too.
<h3>2. What are Habitat for Humanity homes like?</h3>
To make housing as livable and affordable as possible, Habitat constructs homes with these three main characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li>Small</li>
 	<li>Safe</li>
 	<li>Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
Compare this to standard house shopping where agents show you homes that are too big, too expensive, and inefficient, and it’s easy to see why Habitat for Humanity is an excellent option for housing on a budget.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>3. For whom is Habitat housing ideal?</h3>
If you’ve always dreamed of owning your first home in a safe community for your family, Habitat may be just what the doctor ordered.

And if you’re also looking for a home that is, as mentioned above, small, safe, and easy to maintain, a Habitat for Humanity home may be right for you too.
<h3>4. Are Habitat for Humanity eligibility requirements the same everywhere you go?</h3>
No. And since Habitat has offices in over 70 countries worldwide, the prerequisites to qualify for housing will depend on where you live.

With that being said, there are some basic prerequisites, which we’ll discuss now.
<h3>5. What are Habitat’s basic eligibility requirements?</h3>
As stated, Habitat does not randomly “gift” homes for free. You will have to apply to qualify.

When you do apply, you will have to meet three standard prerequisites of being a legal resident, having a stable income, and having decent credit.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>6. What are the income limits for Habitat for Humanity housing?</h3>
These vary depending on location. You can find out the limits and more by contacting your local Habitat for Humanity here.
<h3>7. Once you qualify, what are you expected to do?</h3>
You will have to perform “sweat equity” to contribute to the construction of your home in some way. This could include actual labor, or attending classes and doing administrative work.
<h3>8. Besides sweat equity, what else is required to own a Habitat home?</h3>
Since the home will not be free, you will have to make monthly mortgage payments on time. If this seems worrisome, remember that the program makes them as affordable as possible, so your dream of owning a home can come true.","What are the prerequisites to get approved for Habitat for Humanity housing?

3190,"Is Telemedicine Your Best Bet For Staying Healthy?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The worldwide spread of the coronavirus has led many people to start stocking up on supplies to play it safe. But is the coronavirus the only issue that can negatively impact your health? Of course not, which is why your healthcare coverage should always be a concern.

What can keep you from having proper healthcare? Its ever-increasing prices, which is why the need to seek less costly solutions is a must.

Telemedicine is one of those solutions, and we’ll discuss how it can give you some much-needed peace of mind and care in these uncertain times.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>What Is Telemedicine?</h3>
Even though it’s been around for over 40 years, the term telemedicine (or telehealth) might be new to you. In simple terms, it connects a medical professional with a patient through a portal so they can exchange information.

As an example, you may need some care or advice after specific flu-like symptoms appear. To get the care you need, you connect to a medical professional (a doctor) through a portal (the Internet).

While this may seem like something from the future, it’s here now, and you can benefit from telemedicine in many ways. Not only is it quick and convenient, but it’s also more cost-effective than traditional healthcare.
<h3>The Benefits of Telemedicine</h3>
<h4>Affordability</h4>
Some people are paying a considerable portion of their paycheck to healthcare coverage that they may never use. With telemedicine, you can enjoy coverage for much less, which leaves more money in your budget for other expenses.

After all, healthcare is supposed to be a relief and some form of protection. But if it’s so expensive that it causes undue stress which could lead to medical issues, is it really worth it?

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Convenience</h4>
The last thing you want to do when you’re sick is have to schedule a doctor’s appointment and visit their office. By going to a doctor’s office in person, you put yourself at further risk of getting sicker by being around others who are ill.

On the flip side, you can endanger other people as well. This is extremely important whenever something as contagious as the coronavirus strikes, as it can accelerate the spread of disease.

With telemedicine, the doctor’s office comes to you via a secured call or video chat. And you can get the advice you need, plus a prescription if necessary, without leaving your home.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>Better Access</h4>
Depending on where you live, you could be limited to a small range of healthcare providers. If you’re sick or suffer from a rare condition and have to drive long distances to see a specialist, this could make your situation even worse.

Thanks to telemedicine, your location doesn’t matter. As long as you can connect via phone call or chat, you can reach a medical professional who can give you the specialized care you need.
<h4>Reviews</h4>
Online reviews make it easy to see who’s best in their field. Telehealth review services can give you a glimpse into what other patients have to say about particular providers. This can give you added confidence before choosing one for your needs.

While word of mouth can help you find an in-person doctor in your area, online reviews expand your reach almost instantly.","The latest coronavirus scare may have you thinking more heavily about healthcare.

If there ever was a time to <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-start-building-your-emergency-fund-with-just-one-penny/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">have an emergency fund</a>, it’s now, as the coronavirus could lead to a loss of income and possible isolation in your home.

Does this mean you should panic if you don’t have funds saved for a rainy day? Not necessarily, as you can still meet this emergency head-on by making some simple moves that can save you money in the process.
<h4>Use Telemedicine Versus Traditional Healthcare.</h4>
What’s the number one tip health professionals are spouting over the airwaves right now? If you feel sick, stay home. Doing so can keep you from overwhelming doctors’ offices and hospitals.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Such a recommendation may not be reassuring with all the doom and gloom floating around. Luckily, you can still get medical attention via telemedicine (aka telehealth). Unlike a regular in-person visit to the doctor’s office, telemedicine gets you the help you need via the phone or video chat.

You may have seen telemedicine discussed on the news lately. That’s because it can help doctors treat more patients from a distance without spreading illness via face-to-face interaction. In other words, it comes in handy with COVID-19.

Not only is telemedicine quicker, safer, and more convenient than traditional appointments, but it can also save you money.

Telehealth consultations can cost less than the insurance copay at your doctor’s office. And if you think you have COVID-19, you may pay nothing for testing, as many insurers are now waiving such costs linked to the coronavirus.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Get Free Prescription Delivery</h4>
Many experts say you should have a 30-day supply of medication handy if you need it daily. If COVID-19 results in a 14-day quarantine, this suggestion will undoubtedly come into play.

You can sometimes get 90-day prescriptions delivered to you, which would give you a nice stockpile of essential medications, just in case. By arranging for delivery now, you’ll be less likely to run into supply issues later on.

As for delivery charges, CVS Pharmacy just announced that they would waive delivery charges for prescriptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak, making it a great time to take advantage of that offer.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Buy What You Need and What Will Last</h4>
Although we don’t yet know if there will be a widespread quarantine or how long the coronavirus scare will last, refrain from scooping up every supply you see. Even if you witness others doing it, wasting money on excessive supplies like pallets-worth of toilet paper isn’t wise.

Even though most expect the electricity to stay on, stray from strictly buying foods that can spoil. Sure, you can buy frozen foods for use later on, but know that anything that needs refrigeration comes with a bit of risk.

Canned goods can last for a long time and are often quite affordable. And when picking foods or any other supplies, always go with the generic options. As this is an emergency, the need for more expensive brand name items diminishes since you should strive to save as much money as possible.","As the coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads across the globe, the possibility of an upcoming quarantine in your area is increasing.

Experts stress the importance of savings and having an emergency fund to cover you for three to six months should you need it. That’s tough on a limited income, which is why it’s good to know certain services and companies are helping during the coronavirus outbreak.

Whether you need food, financial help, or some other service, here are some ways to get it:

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Local Schools</h4>
Most school districts have decided to close their doors across the country. This puts a significant strain on families when you consider the high costs of childcare.

Despite the bad news, some districts have announced that they will continue to offer free or low-cost meals to those who need them.
Contact your school district to find out if you qualify.
<h4>2. The Salvation Army</h4>
This nonprofit organization has stepped to the plate once again to help the most vulnerable with food and shelter.

Although they’ve been forced to change how they operate certain soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and the like due to social distancing, they’re still offering help in the form of:
<ul>
 	<li>Food delivery.</li>
 	<li>Meals in to-go boxes.</li>
 	<li>Emotional and spiritual care via video calls.</li>
 	<li>And more.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. 211</h4>
By dialing 211 on your phone or visiting their website, you can get help with paying your bills, securing housing assistance, finding food, and more.

While this service linked to the United Way has been around for a while, it’s now ramped up its efforts to help those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
<h4>4. Modest Needs</h4>
You can contact Modest Needs if you’ve suddenly run into trouble due to COVID-19. The nonprofit offers grants to low-income families when times get tough, and they can give you help to cover your medical bills, utilities, or rent.

If you’re an hourly worker, you’ll be glad to know that Modest Needs has launched a fund to help those who’ve lost income due to the coronavirus outbreak. Visit their site at the link above to learn more and apply for financial support.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>5. Utility Companies</h4>
While we could make a long list of ways to reduce your electricity, gas, and water bills, there’s a better way to handle this issue: Contact your utility companies directly.

Some have already announced that they will not turn off services due to a lack of payment during the COVID-19 outbreak. Don’t assume that your company has done this already, though. Instead, call them up and see what your options are.

You may have to explain your hardship to work out a payment plan or keep your utilities on. If they agree, try to get something in writing, should you run into any problems down the road.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Food Banks</h4>
COVID-19 and the call for social distancing have made life quite complicated for food banks. Many have seen a reduction in volunteers and food donations, which limits their ability to help.

Still, you may find food banks in your area that are offering pickup service and emergency food boxes. Feeding America is one of them that provides services in every state.","How can you stay afloat during the coronavirus crisis?

Even though most never do it, you can negotiate with your landlord to lower your rent even after you’ve signed a lease. The best time to send this letter is a month or two before your lease ends, but you can also write it when you feel like you’ll have trouble paying the full rent amount.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Is there a sample letter to lower the rent that you can use as a guide? Yes, there is, and you’ll find it below.

Feel free to change it up to your liking and style, and remember that the more details and arguments you include in your favor (such as research on lower rents and vacancies in the area), the better. Even if your landlord rejects your request, at least you tried.

<em>After doing some research on local rents, I believe that a small reduction in my monthly payment is reasonable compared to what others in the neighborhood are paying. I know this by asking them firsthand.</em>

<em>I am asking for a [dollar amount] reduction in my monthly rent, which keeps it in line with the neighborhood average. This reduction would help me continue living in the property, and would also provide you with several benefits.</em>

<em>A vacancy comes with several hassles that can be time-consuming and costly, such as listing the property, repairing and preparing it for a new tenant, processing applications, background checks, and more. Through a simple reduction in my rent, you could avoid all of these issues and not have to worry about losing rental income until the property is filled once again.</em>

<em>Please let me know if there is something I could do for you to make this arrangement possible, such as signing a longer lease or increasing my security deposit. And if you would like to discuss this in person, I am available to do so whenever you’re free.</em>

To convey that argument to your landlord and buy you additional time, use the rent hardship letter template in this article.

Besides getting sick of social distancing, here’s something else you probably have in common with many people right now: The inability to pay your rent due to a loss of income or work from COVID-19.

Although many monthly payments are moving towards a freeze right now until things get back to normal, your landlord may not be so lenient.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Before you get evicted or ignore the problem altogether, you should write a hardship letter to not only explain your issues, but also to get extra time to pay your landlord.

Here is a simple template you can use as a guide. Edit it to include your information or add any extra details you wish to use to bolster your argument.

<h4>Tips to Make Your Rent Hardship Letter Better</h4>
The more details you can include in your letter, the more persuasive your argument will be. Unless it’s specifically listed in your lease via a hardship clause or evictions are put on hold (as is the case in some states due to COVID-19), your landlord doesn’t have an obligation to let you skip this month’s rent.

For this reason, it’s best to put your all into your hardship letter and be as convincing as you can.

As you explain your issue, here are some tips to get the desired outcome:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss how the hardship specifically affected your life and altered your income.</li>
 	<li>With COVID-19, for instance, you could say that you lost hours at work, were laid off, or the business where you worked was forced to shut down.</li>
 	<li>Be factual and not emotional.</li>
 	<li>Be polite and ask for their understanding, instead of being demanding in your tone.</li>
 	<li>Stress how you will fix the situation. This may be more crucial than describing why you can’t pay the rent, as the landlord wants to know when and how they will receive payment before they accept your request.</li>
 	<li>Polish your letter by describing how you’ve been a good tenant by always making timely payments, keeping the property in excellent condition, etc.</li>
</ul>

3195,"How To Get Assistance With Lost Income, Food, Healthcare, And More","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are various ways you can seek assistance regarding lost income, unemployment, food, utilities, and healthcare.
<h4>Coronavirus Stimulus Checks</h4>
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act can provide some much-needed cash in two main ways.

The first is via $1,200 stimulus checks for individuals or $2,400 for couples that qualify based on income.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are the basic requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Individual – Gets $1,200 if they have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $75,000 or less.</li>
 	<li>Married couple filing a joint return – Gets $2,400 if their combined income is $150,000 or less.</li>
 	<li>Head of household who’s a single parent with at least one child living at home for over half the year – Gets $1,200 check if their AGI is less than $112,500.</li>
 	<li>Children under 16 in the household – Extra $500.</li>
</ul>
Single people making more than $75,000 can earn up to $99,000 and still qualify for a smaller check. The same holds for couples with a combined income of up to $198,000. Heads of households can earn up to $136,500 to qualify for a smaller check too.

Tax returns from 2018 or 2019 will be used to determine eligibility. Not filing taxes for either of those years may affect your eligibility. Those who do not have a Social Security number, nonresident aliens, or dependents will not be eligible.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Unemployment Compensation From the Cares Act</h4>
Beyond $1,200 stimulus checks, the CARES Act also addresses issues with unemployment benefits. Although states offer their own unemployment compensation, the CARES Act will provide $600 extra per week for those who qualify. These benefits are expected to last for a maximum of 13 weeks.

Regarding eligibility, here is how the CARES Act defines an unemployed person:

A worker who was furloughed, laid off, or has proof of missed income or employment due to the coronavirus. Part-time workers, gig workers, and freelancers are included in this definition if they’ve been affected by work changes as a result of COVID-19.
<h4>State Unemployment Assistance</h4>
States have unemployment programs that can boost your income even more. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average weekly unemployment benefit is $385.

You can apply to your state’s unemployment program by using the Department of Labor’s CareerOneStop tool.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Food Assistance</h4>
There are various programs available for families who need help purchasing food. They include:
<ul>
 	<li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</li>
 	<li>SNAP for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)</li>
</ul>
On a local level, food pantries and charities like the Salvation Army and United Way may be able to help.
<h4>Utilities Assistance</h4>
Some utility companies have relaxed billing during the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce the negative economic impact families are currently experiencing. You can contact your local companies to see if they’ve made any changes to their billing procedures. If not, you can ask them for options regarding payment plans by explaining your situation.

Another option is to consult the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which offers assistance with heating and cooling costs for families in need.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Healthcare Coverage</h4>
If you’ve become unemployed or have a lapse of employment during the COVID-19 outbreak, COBRA Continuation Coverage may help. You can also consult Medicaid or Medicare to see if they can give you the coverage you need during these uncertain times.","Are you worried about how you’ll keep your family afloat during the coronavirus crisis?","2020-04-07 17:02:57",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-get-assistance-with-lost-income-food-healthcare-and-more/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_752375233.jpg,shutterstock_752375233.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_752375233.jpg,3030,shutterstock_752375233,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_752375233.jpg,"Financial Help","Food Assistance",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-get-assistance-with-lost-income-food-healthcare-and-more,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:26"

You want to keep your credit score as high as possible so you can take out loans and credit cards with low interest rates.

Is paying on time good enough to achieve that goal? It may not be anymore, as the Fair Isaac Corporation recently announced its updated FICO Score 10 Suite credit rating system.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is FICO 10?</h4>
According to the company’s press release, the FICO 10 Suite helps lenders make better lending decisions. By using trended data from credit bureaus, lenders can more precisely predict if you will be a trustworthy borrower. FICO 10 is set to launch this summer.

What is trended data? Information that gives lenders a clearer insight into your last 24 months of credit history.

Creditors and lenders want to ensure borrowers can pay their loans back. In doing so, they can prevent costly defaults. With FICO 10, defaults can supposedly be reduced by as much as 17 percent for mortgage loans, 10 percent for new cards, and nine percent for auto loans.

While the use of trended data can help lenders reduce their risk, what does this mean for you, the consumer? In a nutshell, it means that your credit score could either increase or decrease, even if you don’t change your credit habits much.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How FICO 10 Can Affect Your Credit Score</h4>
Millions of consumers are expected to be affected by FICO 10. If your credit behavior involves paying off debt quickly or keeping low balances, you could see your score increase.

Late or missed payments, meanwhile, will likely result in a credit score drop, as will carrying running credit balances each month. Also, if you take out personal loans to pay off those balances and incur even more debt, FICO 10 could penalize you with a score decrease.

Your credit utilization ratio will become more critical than ever. It’s the amount of credit you’re using compared to your overall limit. As a general rule, you want to keep your ratio under 30 percent.
<h4>Tips for Keeping Your Credit Score High After FICO 10</h4>
It’s no secret that late or missed payments can lower your credit score, so do your best to always pay on time. As mentioned, your credit utilization ratio is vital. Keep it under 30 percent by paying as much of your monthly balances as possible.

If you’re in the market for a car loan, mortgage, credit card, or personal loan, remember that FICO 10 won’t roll out to lenders until this summer. This gives you some time to adjust your credit behavior, so you won’t be penalized once the new system launches.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Check Your Score With Your Free Credit Report</h4>
The best way to stay informed of any changes in your credit score is to get your free annual report. It will let you know where you stand as a borrower and tell you which companies or government agencies have been looking at your credit.

By seeing your credit score and account history, you can look for any errors that could lower your score. You can also see if you’ve been a victim of identity theft should any unknown accounts appear.

At the very least, you should check your score once a year. Since you get one annual credit report free, there’s no excuse not to take advantage of this opportunity that can protect your financial future.","If you see your credit score drop in 2020, the new FICO Score 10 Suite credit rating system could be to blame.","2020-04-09 16:43:07",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/these-new-fico-10-changes-could-make-your-credit-score-drop-in-2020/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ufn-hero-1000.jpeg,ufn-hero-1000.jpeg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ufn-hero-1000.jpeg,3032,ufn-hero-1000,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ufn-hero-1000.jpeg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,these-new-fico-10-changes-could-make-your-credit-score-drop-in-2020,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:21"

<h4>Let Your Landlord Know Ahead of Time</h4>
Hiding from your landlord will only frustrate them. It certainly won’t help your case when trying to gain some leeway with the rent, either.

Communication is key. As soon as you know there will be an issue, tell your landlord. Explain why you’re coming up short and how this will affect your monthly payment.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Telling them your financial problems is just half of what you need to do, however, as you also need to discuss the solution.

Merely telling your landlord that you don’t have enough to pay them may not be enough to win the argument. Instead, tell them what you’re doing to ensure that you can pay the rent as soon as possible.

Are you looking for jobs? Are you expecting some sort of assistance? Regardless of which moves you’ll be making, communicating that to your landlord is essential, so they get the whole picture.

As a side note, your tone, attitude, and approach when discussing this issue may be just as important as the problem itself. Keep your calm and be polite. If things get heated, your chances of skipping the rent due to financial trouble may be slim.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Make It Official</h4>
Talking to your landlord in person or giving them a call may suffice if you can’t pay the rent. To show you’re serious, however, write them a hardship letter instead.

This letter explains your financial troubles and how you plan to rectify the situation. If you don’t know how to write a rent hardship letter, you can find examples on the Internet.
<h4>Aim for a Payment Plan or Lower Rent</h4>
Your landlord may not be willing to let you skip a payment entirely or put it off to a later date. If so, you can try to negotiate a lower rent payment so that it fits your finances, or you can set up a payment plan.

When negotiating a lower rent, you’ll need to discuss why you can’t afford the full amount. You will also have to detail reasons why your landlord should accept your offer, such as being a good tenant, usually paying on time, etc.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

If you know you will have the rent money later on, a payment plan could help as you pay in installments instead of all at once.
<h4>Look for a Hardship Clause</h4>
Some leases have hardship clauses that will let you move out without penalty. If you do not wish to continue living in the unit, such a provision could be your easiest solution if no other options are open.
<h4>Let the Government Help You</h4>
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may be able to help you find funding to pay your rent. If not, look for more local programs online by searching your location plus the term “rental assistance.”","Eviction from your home could thrust your family into even tougher times.

<h3>Why Choose Habitat for Humanity?</h3>
Before listing the steps you’ll need to follow to become a Habitat for Humanity homeowner, let’s briefly discuss why the program may be the right fit for you.

First, Habitat for Humanity makes owning a home affordable for many families who see it as something that’s way out of reach. While the program’s homes are not free, their mortgages are, on average, lower than what you’d pay for similar homes.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Second, Habitat homes are constructed with efficiency in mind. Instead of having to pay for a home that is larger and more expensive than what you need, you can get a Habitat home that is smaller, energy-efficient, and more cost-effective, so it fits comfortably within your budget.

Third, the “sweat equity” Habitat for Humanity requires gives you leverage for moving into a new home, even if you don’t have a ton of cash for a down payment.

By showing a willingness to partner with the program via helping with construction, administrative work, or attending classes, you can avoid the hefty costs that come with moving into a new home. In short, you can use your sweat equity as a form of currency.

Lastly, Habitat for Humanity has shown benefits that extend far beyond just living in a new home. According to statistics, families that have moved into Habitat houses often see their children attend college at a higher rate than their counterparts.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Homeowners, meanwhile, have also shown a propensity to become financially independent thanks to having a stable foundation at home.
<h3>Habitat for Humanity’s Path to Homeownership</h3>
<h4>1. Get screened by your local Habitat office.</h4>
The entire path to homeownership via Habitat for Humanity can take anywhere from four to 18 months. To save time, you will be initially screened to ensure you fit well with the program in terms of income, the ability to pay, willingness to perform sweat equity, etc.

You can begin this part of the process by contacting your nearest Habitat for Humanity affiliate here.
<h4>2. Complete the written application.</h4>
After you pass the initial screening, you will complete a written application by providing information regarding your household, income, and more and submitting it to your local office, usually in person.

Any information provided on your application will be verified by Habitat for Humanity, and background checks will be run as well.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. Have your in-person visit.</h4>
Think of this as a job interview, where a member of the Habitat team will interview you to verify information and ensure that you have what it takes to become the program’s next homeowner.

After your application and interview are finished, the office will decide to reject or accept your request. If approved, you will then sign the partnership agreement, which will detail what you must do to make homeownership official.
<h4>4. Perform sweat equity.</h4>
As mentioned, sweat equity plays a large part in the Habitat for Humanity homeownership process. In this step, you will help to construct your home or others nearby or perform administrative duties, plus attend classes on credit repair, maintaining your home, and more.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Celebrate with the dedication ceremony.</h4>
Some local Habitat offices hold dedication ceremonies where homeowners get handed the keys to their new house once any closing costs (which are usually very affordable) are paid.","Habitat for Humanity can put you and your family in a safe, affordable, and energy-efficient home.

3200,"Want Free Product Coupons? Do This","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Who doesn’t love free stuff? Getting it takes nothing from your bottom line, and it also gives you a feeling of satisfaction knowing you didn’t have to pay a penny for that product.

While typical coupons can help you save via discounts on products, free product coupons take things to another level.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Why would a brand offer free product coupons? They’ll usually do it to spread the word about an upcoming launch. In short, think of it as quick marketing. Who’s doing the marketing? You, when you receive the product, as the brand hopes you’ll do word-of-mouth advertising with people you know.

With that being said, let’s look at the different ways in which you can get free product coupons.
<h4>Contact the Brand Directly</h4>
Believe it or not, big brands aren’t just inanimate objects that exist to take your money. There are people working at each in a variety of roles, and they probably want to hear from you.

Why would somebody at a massive brand want to hear from you? They want your feedback, because it’s what can make their products better.

Do you have products that you use on a frequent basis? Whether it’s baby food, laundry detergent, shoes, or something else, contact the brand and sound off.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

By simply telling them what you think of their product, they could send you freebies in the form of actual products or coupons.

Oh, and if you think that giving a negative opinion on a product won’t yield any rewards, think again. Even not-so-positive feedback helps a company improve, and they may be willing to give you something in exchange for taking your time to let them know how things could get better.
<h4>Use Facebook’s Like Button</h4>
You probably use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family or for entertainment. In the process of using the social media site, you’ve probably hit the Like button at least once.

Hit the Like on the fan pages for brands or specific products, and you could get a reward for that split second of work.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Is this method as simple liking something once and getting freebies in return? Not always, which is why it’s a good idea to create a Google Alert for “Facebook freebie.”

Once you have that alert set, you can know when a brand launches a new deal by receiving emails that announce the news. You can then use that alert to hit Like or do whatever other task that brand asks in exchange for freebies.

As for who’s given away free products via Facebook, big brands like Yankee Candle, Redbox, and Bath and Body Works are just a few examples.
<h4>Become a Product Tester</h4>
Companies don’t just put brand new products on the market without any testing or feedback. Instead, they put pre-launch products in the hands of people like yourself to see if they’re truly ready for mass consumption.

Cosmetic company L’Oreal will let you sign up to its Consumer Participation Program to test products and receive freebies or cash in return. To find similar programs with other companies, search for “consumer test panelist” or “free product testing” online.","Free product coupons are quite easy to snag, if you know these tricks of the money-saving trade.","2020-04-28 19:43:24",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/want-free-product-coupons-do-this/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_284500190.jpg,shutterstock_284500190.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_284500190.jpg,3040,shutterstock_284500190,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_284500190.jpg,Resources,"_redirect|_welcomehome|Food Assistance",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,want-free-product-coupons-do-this,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-11 15:39:20"

To keep college affordable, here are some online scholarships to help you advance your career from the comfort of your couch.

Being stuck inside from the COVID-19 shutdowns may have you thinking about your future. It may have you looking at new career options that could be achieved by becoming an online college student.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s one big obstacle that comes with this goal? The cost of college, which seems to increase while incomes do not.

How do students usually bridge the gap between income and tuition costs? By taking out costly student loans that often take years or even decades to pay back.

You can avoid this trap by searching and applying for as many scholarships and grants as you can. Best of all, you don’t have to leave home to perform this task, as you can find everything you need right on the Internet.

To give you a taste of the money-saving awards that are currently available, have a look at this list. See what your options are, then perform a search of your own, if needed, to get the education funding you require.

3203,"What To Do When Your Section 8 Wait Time Is Too Long","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Section 8 won’t provide emergency rental assistance. So if you’re just days away from being evicted, it’s best to look for quicker alternatives to appease your landlord.

What will Section 8 provide? Monthly rental assistance paid directly to your landlord from your Public Housing Agency (PHA).

Getting a housing voucher to help with each month’s rent could be a life-changing move. But since getting that voucher could take years to happen, you’ll want to do everything you can to accelerate the process.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

While we can’t guarantee you’ll get your housing voucher tomorrow, here are some proven ways to get it quicker.

How to Get Your Housing Voucher Faster
<h4>1. Use waiting list preferences to your advantage.</h4>
Some PHAs use preferences as a way to prioritize the order on their waiting lists. Preferences can move you closer to the front of the line, giving you a massive advantage over your voucher competition.

Although the list of preferences is long and varies according to location, here are some that you may be able to use:
<ul>
 	<li>Homeless</li>
 	<li>Victim of domestic violence</li>
 	<li>Disabled</li>
 	<li>Elderly</li>
 	<li>Displaced by government action or disaster</li>
 	<li>Living in substandard housing</li>
 	<li>Paying a majority of your income towards rent</li>
 	<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Your PHA can tell you which preferences apply. The more you can use to move through the line quicker, the better.
<h4>2. Keep your information current.</h4>
If your PHA requests information or your income, family composition, contact information, or some other form of data changes, you’ll have to reflect that in your file. If not, you could lose your spot on the waiting list and have to start all over again.

This is why checking your waiting list status frequently is essential. You may be able to check it online or by contacting your PHA.
<h4>3. Apply to other waiting lists.</h4>
You can increase your chances of getting a voucher quicker by applying to more than one waiting list.

Living in a larger metropolitan area can increase your wait time. To overcome this, you may want to apply to a waiting list in a rural area that has a shorter wait. By having both options, you can lessen the risk of having to wait a long time for assistance.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since the average Housing Choice Voucher wait time is 1.5 years, make as many moves listed above as you can. And if you’re wondering what the longest wait is, it’s reported to be seven years, which could seem like an eternity when you need rental assistance now.

If you haven’t applied for Section 8 yet, do it now by contacting your PHA. And once your application is approved, you now know what to do to minimize your waiting list time.

It’s also worth noting that making a waiting list doesn’t automatically mean you’ll get a voucher. It just means you’ve passed specific eligibility requirements for that PHA.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Housing Aid</h4>
Out of the total sum, $5 billion will be allocated to the Community Development Block Grants which will allow cities and states to combat the market disruptions of COVID-19 in the housing market by providing emergency rental assistance and serving the needs of the homeless community.

It also grants the right of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary to waive any necessary requirement aside from those related to labor standards, non-discrimination, and fair housing in order to expedite the use of funds to combat the spread of the pandemic.

The top priority of these government agencies is to guarantee that the needs of the public are fulfilled in a time of dire need such as the present.","Let’s break down the additional COVID Stimulus and where to get a part of it.","2020-05-28 19:15:26",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/stimulus-bill-expands-housing-grants/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1689432424.jpg,shutterstock_1689432424.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1689432424.jpg,3048,shutterstock_1689432424,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1689432424.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,stimulus-bill-expands-housing-grants,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:20:50"
3205,"How To Get SNAP Assistance During COVID-19","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If so, benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can offer some much-needed relief.

Whether you’ve lost your job, lost income, or have been furloughed since COVID-19 arrived on the scene, that hasn’t lessened the need for food. While unemployment assistance and coronavirus stimulus checks can help bolster your finances, SNAP is a more focused way to put food on the table.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Is SNAP?</h4>
If you’ve heard of food stamps before, that’s essentially what SNAP is. The program offers nutritional assistance to low-income individuals and families. Instead of providing that assistance via physical stamps, though, benefits are now loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards.

Benefits are loaded each month, and those who qualify can use their EBT cards in grocery stores and farmers' markets that participate in the program.

Does SNAP cover all items you’ll find in a store? No, as things like pet food, paper products, and alcohol are not included. You can, however, use your SNAP benefits for everyday food items like fruits, vegetables, bread, cereal, and so on.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Eligibility for SNAP</h4>
Income and resources are the two main factors that determine SNAP eligibility. The state you live in and your household size will also determine whether or not you are eligible and how much you can receive per month for food.

When it comes to income, your gross and net income will be analyzed. Your gross income equals your total income that includes things like wages, disability payments, pensions, etc. Your net income is your gross income minus deductions for utility expenses, child care, and more.

Resources like checking and savings accounts will also be part of the eligibility calculation. Although having more than one car may be counted as a resource, your home is not. And if anyone in your household is receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), their resources do not count.

To see your state’s guidelines on income limits, resources, and more, go here.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Applying for SNAP During COVID-19</h4>
Each state handles its own SNAP applications. Usually, states would allow people to apply in person. Since the coronavirus outbreak, that has shifted to more telephone interviews and online applications for safety reasons.

You can kickstart the SNAP application process by contacting your local office through the SNAP State Directory of Resources. Even if you think you have too much income or resources to qualify, contact them anyway. They may be able to point you in the right direction during these times of need.

Beyond SNAP, you may also want to look into the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC. It offers help for young children and women who are breastfeeding or pregnant.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

You can also look for local charities and food banks that are offering assistance. They may be found by doing an online search for food banks in your city or by keeping a close eye on your local news’ websites or social media pages.","Has the COVID-19 outbreak threatened your ability to feed your family?","2021-06-20 16:10:30",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-get-snap-assistance-during-covid-19/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1675735003.jpg,shutterstock_1675735003.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1675735003.jpg,3050,shutterstock_1675735003,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1675735003.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","Food Assistance",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-get-snap-assistance-during-covid-19,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-17 14:23:59"

Working at home seems to be the wave of the future. Even if a pandemic never hit, people are opening their eyes to income-earning opportunities online.

As with any job, you may be wary that you don’t have enough experience to make money working on the Internet. And while experience can surely help, the following jobs show that you can get your feet wet as a first-timer.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Best Entry Level Work-From-Home Jobs</h4>
The following list is just a sampling of work you can do online without having experience.

Remember that before you sign up for anything, you should do your research to ensure the company you’re working for is legitimate. This can be accomplished by searching their name for reviews and testimonials, plus any possible links to scams.
<h4>Customer Service</h4>
Remote work as a customer service representative is one of the more sought-after positions due to its flexibility. If you know how to deal with people and are good at solving problems, becoming a customer service rep may be a perfect fit.

Some customer service jobs will involve a lot of work over the phone, while others may have you chat with clients online.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Here are a few companies that often hire reps to work remotely:
<ul>
 	<li>AmazonApple</li>
 	<li>Working Solutions</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Entry</h4>
These online jobs may be a bit difficult to come by since people usually snatch them up quickly. Data entry is a great way to get started in the work-at-home sector, and it can give you something to fill up your online resume as you move up the ranks.

Some companies that offer data entry jobs include:
<ul>
 	<li>Axion Data</li>
 	<li>Clickworker</li>
 	<li>Cass Information Systems</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Chat Agent</h4>
Similar to a customer service rep, a chat agent helps resolve problems. Since communication between the agent and customer is via online chat, it may be a more relaxed starting position than one that includes a lot of work over the phone.

You can look for chat agent opportunities via The Chat Shop, Indeed, and other online job boards.
<h4>Online Researcher</h4>
Even if you never got paid to do it, you’ve probably searched for something online before. Use that as “experience” to become an online researcher, and you can convert that skill into income.

Companies need online researchers to pinpoint information for a variety of needs. If you have plenty of attention to detail, this may be the perfect work-at-home job for you.

You can find online researcher positions at JustAnswer and Wonder.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Transcriber</h4>
Do you have quick fingers and excellent typing skills? Put them to use as a transcriber, and you can get paid for your time.

The good thing about transcription work is that it doesn’t require a ton of experience. And if you’re not great at typing, you can always improve until you get to the point that you can make it your work-at-home job.

Examples of companies that offer transcription work include TranscribeMe and Tigerfish.","Everyone has to get their start somewhere, especially when it comes to working online.

Before beginning your search, however, find out how you can protect yourself from scams looking to take your hard-earned money or personal information.

If working from home has piqued your interest as of late, you’re certainly not alone. While many jobs have shifted their workers to a telecommuting setup out of necessity, you may feel that it’s the way to go for several reasons.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

First, working from home gives you more freedom in terms of time and your hourly schedule. Second, it can help eliminate out of control childcare costs by keeping you closer to your kids. Third, it can save time and money spent commuting to and from the workplace. And lastly, working from home can open up new opportunities that a regular job cannot.

Although we could continue discussing the benefits of a work-from-home job, let’s shift the conversation to how to begin your search scam-free. It is the Internet, after all, and it has its fair share of con artists looking to take advantage of people seeking employment.
<h4>Define What You’re Looking For</h4>
It’s easy to be distracted by all of the “shiny” offers for employment online. Scammers know this, which is why they’ll inject less-than-legit offers to catch your eye.

There are many ways to avoid this, but the first is to have a clear goal in mind before beginning your search.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

For instance, are you looking for an entry-level job as a virtual assistant? If so, focus on that and do your research before applying anywhere.

Find out how much virtual assistants can make. See where such jobs are being offered legitimately. Research who the biggest employers are for such positions. And so on.

With all of this information at your disposal, you can get a clear picture of what a legit virtual assistant job offer will look like and where to find it. By knowing this, you can avoid getting distracted by online scams that are meant to catch wandering eyes.
<h4>Research Companies Thoroughly</h4>
Once you know exactly what you’re looking for and you think you’ve found a possible winner, research the company before applying.

Do they have a solid reputation? Are there testimonials and positive reviews of employees who have worked with them?

If so, you should be good to go, and you can proceed with the application. If not, you’re better off moving on to the next opportunity.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Avoid Giving out Financial Information</h4>
A legitimate company shouldn’t ask for financial information when applying for a work-at-home job. If they do, avoid disclosing it, or you could get scammed, which brings us to our next tip.
<h4>Do Not Pay to Apply</h4>
Have you ever been to in-person interviews where they charged you money to apply for a position? Probably not, which is why you shouldn’t pay to apply for an online job either.

Companies that ask for an upfront payment are more likely to be pyramid schemes than legitimate opportunities. Remember, you’re in this to make money instead of spending it.
<h4>When in Doubt, Ask for Clarification Before Proceeding</h4>
You should always trust your instincts. If you feel wary of something when applying, there’s nothing wrong with moving on to the next opportunity.

However, if the position seems like a great fit, but you’re unsure, don’t hesitate to contact the company in question for clarification.

A few minutes of extra work when applying can give you much-needed peace of mind. While this could make your job search a bit more taxing, it’s always better to play it safe, especially when navigating uncharted waters.","A work-from-home job may be ideal in this current climate and well into the future.","2020-06-23 18:16:23",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/seeking-a-work-from-home-job-read-this-first/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_407667589.jpg,shutterstock_407667589.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_407667589.jpg,3054,shutterstock_407667589,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_407667589.jpg,Resources,Education,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,seeking-a-work-from-home-job-read-this-first,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-11 15:58:12"
3208,"Can’t Pay Rent Right Now? Here Are Some Dos And Don’ts","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Thanks to recent events, it’s more common than ever. See how you can get out of this predicament without making it worse.

Coming up short on your rent can sometimes be the most lonely feeling in the world. You don’t want to let your landlord down, especially if you promised to be the perfect tenant. More importantly, you don’t want to lose the roof over your head.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

What can you do when you don’t have money for the rent, though? What are the best practices to keep your housing and keep your landlord satisfied until you can come up with the cash to pay? Let’s look at that now.
<h3>The Dos and Don’ts When You Can’t Pay Your Rent</h3>
<h4>Do: Address the issue.</h4>
If there’s one way to make your housing issue worse, it’s avoiding the fact that you can’t pay rent. No matter how far you push that reality to the back of your head, your landlord won’t forget. And once the rent is due, they will wonder where their payment is.

The good news is that you probably won’t be the first tenant who has payment issues, nor the last. Your landlord likely has experience with this problem, and it's how you handle it that will determine how they treat you as a tenant.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

If you know you won’t be able to pay on time, ask your landlord for an extension. The sooner you do this, the better. Make your request in writing to appear professional.

There’s no need to write your letter from scratch, as a rent hardship letter template can give you a guide that just needs to be filled in with your information. You can find such a template rather easily online.

In your rent hardship letter, you’ll have to explain why you need an extension. Is it due to job loss? Have unexpected medical expenses piled up?

Whatever the reason, explain them in detail and be sure to emphasize that they are temporary. Describe all the steps you’re taking to solve the issue, so they know it won’t happen again. This can include moves like:
<ul>
 	<li>Searching for a second job.</li>
 	<li>Going on job interviews.</li>
 	<li>Applying for loans.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

If possible, offer to pay a portion of the rent on time. Give the landlord an exact date when the rest of the rent will be paid, and be sure to follow up on your promise.

A late fee may be necessary per your contract. You can avoid this if this is your first time requesting an extension by reminding your landlord that you’ve always paid on time.
<h4>Do: Be courteous.</h4>
When you signed your lease, you promised to pay a certain amount on a specific day each month. Since you’ll need a favor of an extension, postponement, or waived fees, remember this when communicating with your landlord.

Be courteous and avoid getting in any heated arguments, no matter how stressed you may be. The smoother your request, the more likely your landlord will accept it.
<h4>Don’t: Avoid your landlord.</h4>
Ignoring or avoiding contact with your landlord will only worsen the issue. They will know that you’re avoiding them, and this will make them less likely to give you leeway.

Unless you’re okay with being evicted or having more issues down the line, have an open line of communication with your landlord.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Don’t: Send a check that will bounce.</h4>
If you know there’s no money in your account, don’t send a check that will bounce with the hopes that it’ll buy you some time.

Should the check bounce, you will only upset your landlord even more and tarnish your reputation as a good tenant. You could also incur a bounced check penalty that will increase your debt to the landlord even more.","Not being able to pay the rent is a common theme that hits most people at least once in their lives.","2020-06-30 18:24:35",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/cant-pay-rent-right-now-here-are-some-dos-and-donts/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1339397633.jpg,shutterstock_1339397633.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1339397633.jpg,3056,shutterstock_1339397633,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1339397633.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,cant-pay-rent-right-now-here-are-some-dos-and-donts,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:20:41"
3209,"WIC Food Program: Frequently Asked Questions","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What are your options for putting food on the table as money gets tight due to COVID-19? You could use some of the money from $1,200 CARES Act stimulus checks, as well as $600 per week unemployment benefits, if you qualify.

Food stamps, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, are another option. You could also look at local food banks and community options mentioned in the news.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Is that it, though? Or are there other ways to get the food your family needs to stay healthy during this pandemic? Luckily, that’s not it, as another way to stay fed is through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.

To get you up to speed on how WIC works, let’s look at some common questions and answers on the program.
<h4>1. Who qualifies for WIC?</h4>
Here is a basic list of who is eligible for WIC:
<ul>
 	<li>Women who are pregnant, in the postpartum stage, or are breastfeeding</li>
 	<li>Infants</li>
 	<li>Children up to age five</li>
</ul>
[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Keep in mind that three other main requirements must be met to qualify for WIC beyond those in the list. First, income guidelines must be met. There are two ways to meet this requirement. You can either fall within the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines, which can be found here, or you can become automatically income-eligible via participation in other benefits programs.

For instance, if you or someone in your household receives SNAP benefits or Medicaid, that alone could satisfy WIC’s income requirements.

After income, comes the nutritional risk requirement. A health professional will determine this during what is often a free screening. They will take height and weight measurements, plus test the blood for anemia. Other tests may be performed as well to determine if you have a nutritional risk that falls into one of two categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Medically-based risk – Problems related to pregnancy, underweight, anemia, etc.</li>
 	<li>Diet-based risk – Deficient diet.</li>
</ul>
[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

Lastly, you must meet the state residency requirement. This does not require you to live in a particular place for a specific period, but it does ask that you live in the state where you apply for benefits.
<h4>2. What type of benefits does WIC provide?</h4>
Beneficiaries of WIC food assistance can receive items similar to the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Infant cereal</li>
 	<li>Iron-fortified adult cereal</li>
 	<li>Vegetable juice</li>
 	<li>Vitamin C-rich fruit juice</li>
 	<li>Eggs</li>
 	<li>Milk</li>
 	<li>Cheese</li>
 	<li>Peanut butter</li>
 	<li>Dried and canned beans or peas</li>
 	<li>Canned fish</li>
 	<li>Soy-based beverages</li>
 	<li>Tofu</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Baby foods</li>
 	<li>Whole wheat bread</li>
 	<li>Iron-fortified infant formula</li>
</ul>
Depending on the state agency, some food packages may be delivered to beneficiaries’ homes. Others may receive checks, vouchers, or EBT cards to make purchases of accepted foods.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

3210,"5 Tips For A Successful Distance Learning Scholarship Search","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

One thing that stands in many people’s ways when it comes to continuing their education is cost. College is anything but cheap, and with the current economic climate, money can be hard to come by.

Does this mean you should put off your dreams of getting your degree? Not at all, because you can make distance learning at home more affordable by searching for scholarships online.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

To help make your scholarship search a successful one, follow these tips:
<h4>1. Create a personal profile.</h4>
Before you start searching for scholarships, make a comprehensive list of everything that could boost your application, so you increase your chances of success.

For instance, make a list of or collect the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Accomplishments</li>
 	<li>Activities</li>
 	<li>Interests</li>
 	<li>Goals</li>
 	<li>Research papers</li>
 	<li>Essays</li>
 	<li>Projects</li>
 	<li>Poems</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

With this list, you can get a clearer picture of how you look as a candidate. You can then use all of these strengths to quickly search for scholarships that fit your profile and have potential.
<h4>2. Start your search as early as possible.</h4>
It’s never too early to begin searching for distance learning scholarships. If you have kids, you can put this to the test, as there are scholarships out there for children as young as five years old.

Even if you know you won’t be ready to start studying this year, now’s the time to start looking for those cost-cutting scholarships. It will give you more time to do a deep dive and apply for several awards, and it can make it easier to plan your finances.
<h4>3. Look for scholarships in the right spots.</h4>
Depending on your age or where you are in life, you will probably use different search strategies than other applicants. If you’re a high school student, going to your counselor to ask for information would be a logical move.

If in college, you could go to your financial aid office, on-campus alumni offices, or to the department in your field of study to look for opportunities.

If you’re no longer in high school or not enrolled in college, family members may be of help. Ask them if there are any scholarships available through their unions or companies they work for.

Less personal ways to look for award money include using online search engines or scholarship book directories.

As you can see, there are various ways to search for scholarships. Your best bet is to use every method available to expand your reach.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>4. Prepare yourself to apply.</h4>
Since many distance learning scholarships have strict deadlines, you want to make sure you’re ready to apply in time. You can do this via that list above that contains all of your accomplishments and any past works.

If you find a scholarship that fits, you may not need to waste time writing new essays to apply if you’re already prepared.

Lastly, to get a jump on your competition, contact scholarship committees directly. They can tell you what the ideal scholarship candidate looks like, so you can mold yourself into that applicant without the need for any guesswork.
<h4>5. Create your “Why you?” statement.</h4>
Scholarship committees like to think that their financial awards will impact more than one person. Keeping this in mind, you should create a “Why you?” statement that reflects how you will change others once you graduate.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Will this statement only be used in essays? No, as you should find a way to incorporate it into every application. Remember, the goal is to stand out from the crowd and show how the scholarship will not only benefit you, but society as well.

For instance, if you were going to study medicine, your statement could be, “I hope to use my role as a doctor to ensure that low-income children get the medical care they deserve.”","You can make the most of your extended time at home by advancing your education.

3211,"Low Income? These 3 Loan Programs Can Help You Buy A Home","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Contrary to popular belief, buying a home isn’t something exclusively reserved for those with high incomes anymore. Thanks to several programs from the government, home buying is now possible for low-income applicants.

Let’s look at some of these programs now so you can make the move of buying a home soon.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. USDA Home Loan</h4>
Buying a house within city limits can be quite expensive, and this can create a daunting obstacle to homeownership. If you’re willing to look in rural areas, you may be able to qualify for a USDA home loan.

What’s the most significant benefit of using such a loan? The fact that you can buy a home without the need for a down payment. Yes, that’s right, you can become a homeowner via 100 percent financing from a USDA loan, even if you have no money saved.

USDA loans fall into two main categories:
<ul>
 	<li>Direct Program – If your income sits between 50-80 percent of the Area Median Income.</li>
 	<li>Guaranteed Program – If your income goes up to 115 percent of the Area Median Income.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. FHA Loan</h4>
If you don’t have ideal credit, are living on a small income, or are a first-time homebuyer, an FHA loan may be what you need to purchase a house.

The Federal Housing Administration backs this popular low-income loan program, which is intended to make home buying easier by relaxing the requirements necessary to secure a mortgage.

For example, you may be able to get an FHA loan with a 580 credit score or a high debt-to-income ratio of 45 percent. If you can make a 10 percent down payment, you may even be able to purchase a home with a 500 credit score.

[the_ad id=""2907""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. HomeReady/Home Possible Advantage Loans</h4>
This pair of low-income loans feature small down payments. If you can come up with a three percent down payment, you may qualify for a HomeReady loan from Fannie Mae or a Home Possible Advantage loan from Freddie Mac.

While having to put down three percent may seem like a lot, if your income isn’t ideal, it doesn’t necessarily have to come from your pocket. That three percent can come from outside sources, such as a loan from someone else, a gift, or a grant.

Beyond small down payments, HomeReady and Home Possible Advantage loans also offer lower mortgage insurance.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

As an example, let’s say you had a solid 720 credit score. Under a standard mortgage, your insurance would be .95 percent per year. Under these two special loan programs, that number drops to as little as 0.65 per year.

The savings don’t stop there, though, as closing costs can be paid by the home seller, up to three percent of the purchase price. Try negotiating this to ensure your closing costs are included, and you’ll be able to keep even more money in your pocket.","Your dream of owning a home can come true, even if your income isn’t high.

If you want to stick around for your loved ones, you’ll need to ensure your healthcare coverage is up to par. Without it, you could lack the care you need or find yourself in financial trouble by not being able to pay your medical bills.

Medicare is one way many people make sure they get the coverage they need, and its Open Enrollment Period (OEP) is when they can ensure it still covers their needs for the year to come.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Medicare Open Enrollment Explained</h4>
While this article's primary focus is to help you find resources to participate in the OEP, let’s give you a quick refresher on what this particular period is.

Medicare Open Enrollment happens every year. For 2020, its dates run from October 15 to December 7. Make any changes to your coverage within those dates, and you should get to reap the rewards of your new and improved plans on January 1.

Why would you want to make changes to your Medicare coverage? Because there may be changes for 2021 that do not suit your needs.

For instance, in your Annual Notice of Change, you could see that 2021 may bring higher prescription costs, or some of the drugs you need may no longer be covered. Some of your in-network providers or pharmacies may change, making your plan inconvenient. You could also see tweaks to your potential out-of-pocket costs that no longer suit you, making a change to your plans an absolute must.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Reviewing your Annual Notice of Change can mean the difference between peace of mind, better coverage, and lower costs, and finding yourself not liking your 2021 plan any longer.

If you switch to better prescription coverage, you can make sure all of your drugs remain covered while also cutting out-of-pocket costs. Switch your Part D coverage after reviewing it, and research shows you could save an average of $300 per year. You can also change your current plan to one of higher quality. For example, if you are currently under a 3-star plan, switching to a 5-star one during open enrollment could be worth your time.
<h4>Getting Help With the OEP</h4>
Since Medicare Open Enrollment can be overwhelming, you may be best served by seeking professionals' help on the topic. For starters, you could go to the My Medicare Matters site and take their questionnaire. Doing so will put you in touch with a licensed benefits advisor who can give you free professional counseling recommended by the National Council on Aging.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Another option for getting help during the OEP is to contact your local SHIP or State Health Insurance Program. This can result in free Medicare counseling from a volunteer or trained staff member funded by the federal government.

Remember that if you change your coverage using the options above or on your own, you’ll need to get in touch with your providers to let them know.","Medicare Open Enrollment can be complicated, even if you’ve participated in it before.

3401,"Reduce Your Rent By Reading This Public Housing FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are some frequently asked questions on how this government assistance program works.

Its name may not sound appealing, but public housing could become your ideal living situation. How? By putting a roof over your head that doesn’t break the bank, which will allow you to allocate more of your monthly budget to expenses besides rent.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Since you may be unfamiliar with how public housing works, here are some common questions and answers to bring you up to speed:
<h4>1. What is public housing?</h4>
Public housing is a program administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). It offers affordable rentals to those who need it most.
<h4>2. What types of housing can you get through the program?</h4>
Depending on where you live and the availability, you could find yourself living in an apartment, townhome, or single-family home through the public housing program.
<h4>3. How do you become eligible for public housing?</h4>
If you’re familiar with Section 8 vouchers, you’ll notice that many of the eligibility requirements for public housing are the same. Here’s what your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) will use to determine your eligibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Your status as a low-income family, senior citizen, or a person with a disability.</li>
 	<li>Your citizenship status.</li>
 	<li>Your annual gross income.</li>
</ul>
Other factors may also come into play with your PHA.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>4. How can you apply for public housing?</h4>
Your PHA will be your main contact throughout the application process. You can find yours by going <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.

Once you get the ball rolling, either you or a housing counselor will complete your application.
Here are some bits of information you will need to complete it:
<ul>
 	<li>Your current phone number and address.</li>
 	<li>Names and dates of birth of everyone who will be living in public housing with you.</li>
 	<li>Contact information for your current and previous landlords.</li>
 	<li>The sources of income and an estimate of how much your family will make within the next year.</li>
 	<li>Contact information for your employers, banks, etc., to help verify your income.</li>
 	<li>Knowledge of any conditions that could accelerate your application, such as currently living in substandard housing, status as a veteran, etc.</li>
</ul>
In addition to your application, the PHA may require an in-home interview to evaluate you and your family as possible tenants. Unlike other living situations, the PHA serves as your landlord in public housing, which is why they’ll most likely request this interview before making a decision.
<h4>5. What happens after you apply for public housing?</h4>
If you become eligible for public housing, you will be placed on a waiting list until a home becomes available.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>6. What is the wait time for public housing?</h4>
There’s no definite answer to this question. However, like Section 8 housing vouchers, you can expect long wait times since the demand for public housing is so high. You may be able to get housing more quickly if you apply in an area with lower demand.","Public housing can take a major financial load off of your shoulders by making your rent more affordable.","2020-12-02 21:19:47",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/reduce-your-rent-by-reading-this-public-housing-faq/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1481305970.jpg,shutterstock_1481305970.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1481305970.jpg,3402,shutterstock_1481305970,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1481305970.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,reduce-your-rent-by-reading-this-public-housing-faq,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:28"
3404,"Need Affordable Rent? See How The Government Can Help","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Ask most people what they worry about each month, and many will say being able to pay their rent on time. This is because we all need a roof over our heads, and rent can be so expensive, it can take a huge chunk out of your budget.

While you could get a second job or work extra hours to ensure your rent is always paid promptly, there’s a better way to make that monthly payment more affordable while living in a safe, clean space. What is it? Getting help from the government via different programs that it offers. Let’s take a look at some of the more common ones:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Privately-Owned Subsidized Housing</h4>
You don’t necessarily have to live on government property to participate in a program for affordable rent. Take the privately-owned subsidized housing route, and you can get a low-rent apartment from an owner that isn’t Uncle Sam.

If you choose this avenue for affordable rent, you’ll apply for government assistance through the property’s own rental office. You can find such properties by using the HUD Resource Locator found <a href=""https://apps.hud.gov/apps/section8/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>. It makes it easy to see what’s available near you so you can start your search.

Keep in mind that if you want to use privately-owned subsidized housing, there will be some requirements. You will have to make less than the income limit for your family size and location for starters. Beyond that, you will also have to meet certain requirements from the property’s owner.

As for what a private property owner gets out of this deal, the government will give them money to participate in the program, which reduces the amount of rent you’ll end up paying out of pocket.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers</h4>
You’ve probably heard of Section 8 before, as its Housing Choice Vouchers make rent very affordable. They do so by limiting the amount of rent you must pay monthly, with a large portion of that payment coming from the government and going directly to the landlord. You’ll be expected to pay the remainder.

If you choose Section 8, you’ll look for your own housing that participates in the program. This can be a townhouse, apartment, or even a single-family home that meets specific Section 8 standards. As for how much your voucher will be worth, that will depend on local housing costs, your income, and the size of your family.

Your Section 8 eligibility will depend on whether you’re a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen, making less than the program’s income limits, and your family composition. You can apply for Section 8 by going <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and contacting your local Public Housing Agency (PHA).
<h4>Public Housing</h4>
In this arrangement, you’ll rent a townhouse, apartment, or single-family home from your PHA. The eligibility requirements are similar to Section 8, and the type of housing you can get and how much you’ll pay will depend on your income.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Before you can be accepted into public housing, know that the PHA may contact your past landlords and require an in-person visit with you to see if you’re a good fit as a tenant.

To apply for public housing, go <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and contact your PHA.","Is your income low enough that you wonder how you’ll pay the rent each month?

3415,"Visit These Money-Saving Sites Before Making Your Next Purchase","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

These sites will help you do that, so be sure to visit them before spending a single dollar online or in person.

No matter how much money you have, this much is probably true: You want to save as much of it as possible. Thanks to the Internet, this goal is incredibly easy to achieve, and these sites make it simple:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>SnipSnap</h4>
How many times have you gone to a store, excited about a deal you just saw, only to realize that you forgot your coupons at home? It’s quite a common occurrence, but you can overcome it with the SnipSnap app.

The app lets you take pictures of your paper coupons, so you always have them nearby, provided you bring your phone along for the ride. This ensures you never forget a coupon at home, but you can also use the app to find even more coupons for your shopping trips.

As the app says on its website, SnipSnap puts “thousands of offers in your pocket,” making it super simple to start saving.
<h4>Flipp</h4>
Have you spent several Sundays in your past clipping coupons from the local newspaper? You probably have, and while that’s a popular way to save, there’s no need to be so “old fashioned” about it anymore.

With Flipp, you can see those weekly circulars on your computer, phone, or tablet. You can clip coupons digitally, save them, and even make a shopping list, so you don’t forget anything.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

While the coupon-clipping feature is certainly helpful, being able to make a shopping list within the app can help you save too. How? By preventing costly impulse purchases, as long as you pledge to stick to your list.
<h4>Coupon Sherpa</h4>
Finding paper coupons before heading out to a brick and mortar store can be quite time-consuming. With Coupon Sherpa, you don’t need a newspaper to get those savings, as the app lets you search for in-store coupons and deals right from your electronic device of choice.

This search feature can save you a ton of time, and when it’s time to purchase in a store, you can simply scan your phone to get those savings with no paper coupons necessary. If, for some reason, you do love those paper coupons, though, Coupon Sherpa has a printable feature too.
<h4>Wikibuy</h4>
This popular app now goes by the name of Capital One Shopping, but it still has the same features that made it such a hit.

Whenever you shop on Amazon, the app will comparison shop to ensure you’re getting the best deal. This is essential for saving since many people automatically assume that Amazon is the cheapest, when that’s not always the case.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Fetch Rewards</h4>
Hitting stores during sales and using coupons aren’t the only ways to save money when shopping, as rewards can work wonders too.

Fetch Rewards is an app that lets you scan your grocery receipts to earn points. Get enough points, and you can use them to buy gift cards.","Do you want to maximize your savings so you can hold on to more of your hard-earned money?

3418,"Have Kids? Do This To Find Cheap Clothes","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Even if kids never grew, their clothes would be costly. But since they do grow (and quite quickly), the cost of kids’ clothes can seem astronomical.

Unlike other expenses in your monthly budget, your children’s clothes are an absolute necessity. You can’t cut them completely as with other costs, like dining out, for example. As such, you’ll need to figure out ways to make their clothes more affordable. But don’t think too hard, as we’ll discuss some of those ways now.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Tips for Finding Cheap Kids’ Clothes</h3>
<h4>1. Find them for free</h4>
You may not have to spend a penny on your kids’ clothes if you can find them for free. Where is this possible? For starters, you can look online in the Craigslist free section, the Freecycle website, or the Facebook Marketplace. People sometimes list children’s clothes there at no cost.

If you have no luck there, don’t forget to ask your friends and family if they have any clothes their kids no longer use. Since kids grow so quickly, they may say yes.
<h4>2. Buy used kids’ clothes online.</h4>
You can find kids’ clothes at a deep discount online if you don’t mind buying them used. Sites like Poshmark, ThredUp, and Kidizen are just a few examples of where you can find secondhand clothes at deep discounts.
<h4>3. Go to garage sales.</h4>
You’re likely to find almost-free kids’ clothes at garage sales. Be sure to show up early, or you may miss out.
<h4>4. Visit thrift shops.</h4>
Beyond garage sales, thrift shops are the best local spots to find kids’ clothes on the cheap. If you don’t know of any, search the Internet for “thrift stores near me” and should see at least one pop up.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->
<h4>5. Shop at discount retailers.</h4>
Will your kids want the newest Nike clothes or the latest Jordan shoes? Possibly, but your budget may not allow for such splurging. Instead of paying a premium for children’s clothes, visit discount retailers like Walmart, Target, Ross, Marshalls, and T.J. Maxx. You can also find deals at liquidation stores like Big Lots.
<h4>6. Hit the clearance rack.</h4>
Head to the back of most clothing stores, and what will you find? Clearance racks that often have the biggest discounts on clothes.

You don’t have to rely on store sales when clearance racks can offer even better deals. And if a store has a sale that also applies to the clearance section, you can get a massive discount with double the savings.
<h4>7. Avoid outfits.</h4>
Are kids’ outfits adorable? Yes, and retailers know this, which is why they often place their best-dressed mannequins at the front of the store. Avoid the temptation to buy those cute kids’ outfits, and you can save a ton by buying pieces instead.

You’ll get much more flexibility buying pieces versus outfits. The cost will be lower, and you can mix and match the pieces to get more bang for your buck.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>8. Buy out of season.</h4>
Just because clothes are out of season doesn’t mean you should overlook them. Provided you get a bigger size to account for your children’s growth, you can save a nice chunk of change by purchasing out of season clothes when they go on sale.","Kids’ clothes are anything but cheap, but if you follow these simple tips, you should find them much more affordable, so they fit your budget.","2020-12-17 19:33:21",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/have-kids-do-this-to-find-cheap-clothes/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1044580621.jpg,shutterstock_1044580621.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1044580621.jpg,3419,shutterstock_1044580621,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1044580621.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,have-kids-do-this-to-find-cheap-clothes,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:21"
3421,"How To Make Extra Cash Without Getting A Second Job","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you’re like most people, you probably could use some extra cash each month to give your budget some breathing room. With that additional income, you could pay down some of your debt, build an emergency fund, or treat yourself without putting any charges on your credit card.

What’s the most common way to earn extra cash? Getting a second job, but that may not be feasible if you have kids to take care of or already have a full-time job that takes up most of your schedule.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Does this mean you’re completely stuck with living on the income you make right now? Not necessarily, as there are other methods for making more money that don’t involve the time commitment of a second job. Best of all, you can start trying these methods today.
<h4>Using Side Gigs To Earn Quick Cash</h4>
Even if getting a second job was doable with your schedule, it’s not automatic that you could find such work. Why? Because most jobs require some experience.

What’s a money-making way that often does not require a ton of experience? Doing side gigs, especially since you can find them in almost any category you can think of.

Want proof? Take a look at the side gig site called TaskRabbit.
You can use it to find quick delivery gigs, as well as doing tasks like helping people move, painting, and yard work. If you don’t feel like doing anything physical, you can also use the site to find virtual and online gigs, such as research, data entry, working as a virtual assistant, and more.

Is TaskRabbit the only place to find side gigs? No, as there are many other options, including Craigslist, Fiverr, FlexJobs, Freelancer, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Selling Your Stuff Either Locally or Online</h4>
That extra income you seek could be right under your roof. Look around your home, and you’ll probably find several items that you no longer use or want. Instead of tossing them in the trash, you can convert them into fast income by selling them to local buyers or online.

Since the Internet has established markets for almost everything, there’s really no limit to what you can sell (as long as it’s legal). As long as you have a camera to take pictures of your items, you can put them up for sale on sites like Craigslist, eBay, Poshmark, and more to find buyers quite quickly.

As an aside, it’s worth noting that you can use these same sites to find items cheap (or even free on Craigslist) and then resell them at a profit. Many find this practice so lucrative that they turn it into a full-time gig.

<h4>Turn Unused Space in Your Home Into Income</h4>
If you have a spare room, unused garage, or even a parking space that you do not occupy, you could put any of the above up for rent on sites like Airbnb or Stache for extra cash.","There’s no need to get a second job to increase your income, as we’ll discuss some ways you can earn extra money without sacrificing a ton of your time.","2020-12-22 20:21:58",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/how-to-make-extra-cash-without-getting-a-second-job/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1814502944.jpg,shutterstock_1814502944.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1814502944.jpg,3422,shutterstock_1814502944,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1814502944.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-make-extra-cash-without-getting-a-second-job,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 21:24:26"
3425,"Do This Now To Ensure Your Medicare Coverage Is Sufficient","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here’s what needs to be done before open enrollment ends December 7 so you can make sure your coverage is sufficient.

What happens between October 15 and December 7 each year? The Medicare Open Enrollment Period (OEP). What’s its purpose? To give you and other Medicare enrollees time to:
<ol>
 	<li>Look at your current coverage.</li>
 	<li>Assess your healthcare needs.</li>
 	<li>Pick a new plan, if needed.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Even if you don’t complete the third step on that list, the first two should be done yearly. Why? First, Medicare plans can change from year to year regarding what they cost, what’s covered, and more. And second, your health can also change, meaning new coverage may be in the works so you don’t break the bank trying to stay healthy.

What are some things you can do to get the best coverage before Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7? Here they are:
<h4>1. See what’s changed.</h4>
Both your existing plan and Medicare overall can change annually. In terms of your personal plan, an Annual Notice of Change should have been sent to you in the mail sometime in September. If you don’t have it, call up your insurer and ask for a copy.

When looking at the ANOC, play close attention to the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Your 2021 premium.</li>
 	<li>How much the plan will pay for certain expenses.</li>
 	<li>Drug coverage for 2021, including costs.</li>
</ul>
If any of the changes don’t suit your needs, you’ll probably want to shop around for something better.

As for changes to Medicare overall, 2021 will bring the following differences to Advantage plans in the new year:
<ul>
 	<li>More telehealth coverage for services like cardiology, psychiatry, and dermatology.</li>
 	<li>The ability to see a nurse practitioner as your primary caregiver instead of a doctor.</li>
 	<li>Over 4,800 Advantage plans will be available across the country, which is the biggest number ever.</li>
</ul>
Beyond the changes to your plan and Medicare overall, analyze what’s changed with your health in 2020. Do you have different needs now than in the past? Are you taking new drugs? If your current plan doesn’t cover those new needs, you’ll need to get a different one that will.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Know what you can do.</h4>
Medicare Open Enrollment allows you to:
<ul>
 	<li>Switch your Medicare Advantage plan.</li>
 	<li>Switch between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage (and vice versa).</li>
 	<li>Join a part D prescription plan or switch to a different one.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Talk with your doctors.</h4>
You’ll probably want to stick with your current doctors for the peace of mind they can bring. Before making any Medicare-related decisions, call your doctors, and talk to the billing department. Ask them which plans they’ll accept next year so you can pick one they’re linked to.
<h4>4. Start shopping around.</h4>
Even if your current plan offers the coverage you need, shop around to see if you can find something more affordable. You can do this by contacting your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP).

Other options for shopping around that may help include the <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/?lang=en&amp;year=2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medicare Plan Finder</a> and this <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/10050-Medicare-and-You.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medicare &amp; You 2021 handbook</a>.

<h4>5. Pay attention to ratings.</h4>
Once you see some plans that you like, don’t forget to see how they rate based on quality and performance. You can do this via the aforementioned Medicare Plan Finder or by checking out U.S. News &amp; World Report’s listings on Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D.","Gifts aren’t the only thing you should be shopping for these days, as the right Medicare plan should be on your list too.

3440,"6 Tips To Make Your Car Insurance More Affordable","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Many people feel a natural high when they get a new car. But once that monthly payment is due along with their car insurance premium, that high turns into a sigh.

While we won’t discuss how you can <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/gas-is-getting-expensive-do-this-to-pay-less/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reduce your car payment</a>, we will dish the dirt on how to pay less for car insurance without sacrificing necessary coverage.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Make it a family affair.</h4>
You can lower your car insurance premium by adding other drivers to your policy. Insurance companies will often offer this as a way to get more business.

So, if you have any children who are now driving, or your partner or relative who lives with you drives, be sure to add them to get that discount.
<h4>2. Shop around.</h4>
It’s never been easier to see what competitors are offering thanks to the Internet. If your premium is about to increase and your policy is near renewal, shop around and get quotes from other companies.

Do this every year or two to see what’s out there. When doing so, however, remember that the cheapest isn’t always the best. Look for insurance company ratings to ensure you’re making the right move.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Raise your deductible.</h4>
You could see great savings on your car insurance payment by increasing your deductible.
This is what you’ll pay out of pocket if something happens to your car, such as an accident, theft, etc. Once you pay the deductible, the insurance company will then step in to pick up the tab.

As a general rule, the greater your deductible, the lower your premium. Ask your agent all the specifics before making a decision.
<h4>4. Check your credit.</h4>
If you thought car insurance companies didn’t care about your credit history, know that they do.
Improve your credit, and you could see an improvement in terms of your car insurance affordability.
<h4>5. Secure your car.</h4>
If you have an older car that doesn’t have an alarm or some other form of anti-theft device, you may want to consider installing one. Ask your agent how much you could save on your premium by installing an anti-theft device.

As an example, GEICO claims they’ll cut your costs by 25 percent by adding one. And while you’ll have to pay for the device right now, the insurance savings down the line could be worth it.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>6. Get rid of what you don’t need.</h4>
One of the best moves you can make to cut car insurance costs is to review your existing policy.
As you do, you may spot several features that you may never use, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Car rental coverage – Unnecessary if you’ll never use a rental car.</li>
 	<li>Roadside assistance – Seen as a luxury to some.</li>
 	<li>Collision or comprehensive coverage – May be a waste if your car has little to no value due to its age, condition, etc.</li>

3444,"A Closer Look At The School Breakfast Program (SBP)","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

No child should be expected to start a school day on an empty stomach. This may happen, however, if they come from a low-income household where food is scarce.

How can this problem be fixed without taking money out of your own pocket? By soliciting the help of the School Breakfast Program or SBP.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>School Breakfast Program Background</h4>
The School Breakfast Program is nothing new, as it first kicked off in 1966 for a test run. In 1975, the SBP was made into an official entitlement program by Congress.

If you’re worried about a certain stigma attached to using the SBP, don’t be. Statistics show that the number of children using the program for healthy breakfasts has grown over the years. In 1970, only 500,000 children used the SBP. By 1990, that number reached four million. Just four years ago, 14.57 million children were SBP recipients.

As for who’s in charge of the School Breakfast Program, that responsibility lies with the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). They administer the program at the federal level, while state agencies work with local schools to ensure kids get the morning meals they need.

Non-profit private or public schools, charter schools, and residential childcare institutions are the SBP’s most significant participants. If selected for the program, they are expected to serve breakfasts that meet the federal government's nutritional requirements. Those breakfasts must either be free or come at a reduced cost for eligible kids. In exchange for serving breakfasts, participating schools receive cash subsidies from the USDA per meal.

It’s worth noting that if a school serves many low-income students, they could be considered “severe need” institutions. As such, they can receive a higher reimbursement rate. The same holds if the school is located where food costs are significantly higher.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>SBP Eligibility</h4>
Most government assistance programs have eligibility requirements, and the School Breakfast Program is no different. A child can qualify for free or low-cost breakfasts in several ways.

The first is if their household has a family size and income that make the cut. While this requirement may vary according to location, it usually means that the child must come from a household that makes less than 130 percent of the federal poverty level to get free breakfasts. If the home makes between 130-185 percent of the national poverty level, their child could qualify for breakfasts at a reduced price, which cannot exceed 30 cents.

Other ways in which children can qualify for SBP benefits can include if they are a foster child, migrant, homeless, or a runaway. Also, if they participate in any of the following, they could be automatically eligible for free or affordable school breakfasts:
<ul>
 	<li>Head Start Program, at either the federal or state level</li>
 	<li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</li>
 	<li>Other federal assistance programs</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Receiving SBP Benefits</h4>
If your child qualifies for the School Breakfast Program, expect them to be fed in one of the following ways:
<ul>
 	<li>With a “Grab &amp; Go Breakfast” in a plastic or paper bag that they can eat before school or during an AM break.</li>
 	<li>With a “Breakfast in the Classroom” that they can eat during morning attendance or announcements.</li>
 	<li>In a traditional, cafeteria-based setting.</li>
</ul>","You can ensure your child starts the day off right with a healthy breakfast before school. Here’s how the School Breakfast Program works to achieve that goal.","2021-06-20 16:05:57",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/a-closer-look-at-the-school-breakfast-program-sbp/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_290441519.jpg,shutterstock_290441519.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_290441519.jpg,3446,shutterstock_290441519,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_290441519.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","Food Assistance",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,a-closer-look-at-the-school-breakfast-program-sbp,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-17 14:24:04"
3455,"4 Ways President Biden Has Recently Made It Easier To Get Food","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The coronavirus pandemic has hit families hard from coast to coast. While their budgets may be tighter than usual, that doesn’t eliminate the need for food, as it’s necessary to survive.

What can save the day when jobs are lost, and income is greatly reduced? Food assistance from the government, and President Biden recently announced several ways to increase such help alongside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

We’ll discuss them now, so you can see if any of these announcements could help to keep your family fed until things get back to normal.
<h4>1. Extra SNAP Benefits</h4>
If you’ve never been on food stamps or SNAP before, the coronavirus may have changed that, especially if you became unemployed or furloughed due to shutdowns. SNAP can provide families with monthly funds to buy the food they need, and some good news was released regarding this assistance program.

During the spring of last year, Congress approved an emergency increase to SNAP benefits of 15 percent. This was done to combat food insecurity when the pandemic was still relatively new.
Unfortunately, that increase in food stamp benefits didn’t cover the lowest-income household, resulting in nearly 40 percent of SNAP recipients being left out in the cold.

To make the increase in SNAP benefits more accessible, President Biden signed an order to allow states to up their food stamp allotments. This should greatly help the lowest-income households stay afloat when it comes to nutrition.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

While families should take this recent news as a pleasant surprise, increasing SNAP benefits can also uplift the struggling economy as a whole. According to the USDA, for every $1 billion in new food stamp benefits, the United States' GDP receives a $1.54 billion boost.
<h4>2. Changes to the Thrifty Food Plan</h4>
As it stands, around 43 million people rely on SNAP benefits. That number could increase, though, as food stamps become more accessible. President Biden wants the Thrifty Food Plan, responsible for determining food stamp eligibility, to be revised so more people can become eligible.
<h4>3. Increase in Pandemic-EBT</h4>
COVID-19 caused many schools to close down. With these closures, many children who relied on free or low-price school meals saw their nutrition endangered. The Pandemic-EBT program was initiated to give these students funds to replace those missed school meals, and Biden signed an order to increase such funding by 15 percent. Until schools fully open again, this increase in P-EBT funding should help them stay fed and healthy.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Biden’s American Rescue Plan Proposal</h4>
Beyond the moves listed above, Biden also wants Congress to do the following under his American Rescue Plan Proposal:
<ul>
 	<li>Increase nutritional assistance funding for U.S. territories by $1 billion.</li>
 	<li>Support restaurants to help workers’ families.</li>
 	<li>Add $3 billion to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).</li>
 	<li>Keep the 15 percent increase in SNAP benefits in place as long as possible.</li>
</ul>","Are you struggling to fill your fridge with food? If so, you’ll be glad to know that President Biden recently addressed food insecurity to make it easier to get the nutrition your family needs.","2021-06-20 16:35:13",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/4-ways-president-biden-has-recently-made-it-easier-to-get-food/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1501421570.jpg,shutterstock_1501421570.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1501421570.jpg,3456,shutterstock_1501421570,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1501421570.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","Food Assistance",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,4-ways-president-biden-has-recently-made-it-easier-to-get-food,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-17 14:19:32"
3459,"Reduce Your Rent By Asking Your Landlord These 8 Questions","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

It sure can be, and we’ll reveal which questions you should ask your landlord to make it happen.

Lower rent means more money in your pocket and less stress when it comes to paying bills. But to get lower rent, that usually means you have to move, right? Not necessarily, as you could negotiate cheaper rent with your landlord by asking the following questions:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. I love your place, but it’s too expensive for me. Is there any way you could lower the rent?</h4>
You could start with this direct question that gets right to the point. Your landlord could say yes right off the bat if you’ve been the ideal tenant who pays on time and keeps the property in good condition.

At the very least, this question lets your landlord know that they may lose you as a tenant. If they do, they’ll be faced with having to find another tenant, interviewing them, screening them, setting up payments, hoping they’ll treat the property with respect and pay on time, and so on.

The hassle linked to rental turnover works in your favor, which is why this first question is so powerful.
<h4>2. If I sign a longer lease, can you lower my rent payment?</h4>
A longer lease means your landlord won’t have to find a new tenant anytime soon, which saves them all of the aforementioned hassles. Sure, you’ll be in a longer commitment this way, but if you love the place and seek stability, it’s a smart move.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. If I pay the rent at an earlier date, such as before the first of the month, can you lower my rent?</h4>
Putting the rent payment in your landlord’s hands earlier on adds peace of mind. With it, they may be willing to compromise.
<h4>4. Can I pay you bi-weekly in exchange for a lower rent?</h4>
If you get paid on such a schedule, and it doesn’t interfere with your finances, such an arrangement of more frequent payments could convince your landlord to lower the rent.
<h4>5. Can I pay you several months' rent in advance for a lower payment?</h4>
Cash is king, and if your landlord can have several months of it, they won’t have to worry about late payments. This could be a compelling reason to reduce your rent.
<h4>6. Could I work for you in some capacity in exchange for cheaper rent?</h4>
If you’re handy or the landlord needs help, they may be willing to lower your rent in exchange for some work arrangement.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Do you have any referral fees?</h4>
Ask the property manager this if you live in a large building. Referring new tenants could bring in extra income that can make it easier to pay your rent.
<h4>8. Could I rent out part of the property to someone else?</h4>
You could lower your out of pocket costs by putting up a spare room on Airbnb, renting out storage space on a site like StoreAtMyHouse.com, or even renting out a parking space on SpotHero.","Did you know that getting cheaper rent where you currently live could be as easy as asking a few questions?

As if it wasn’t hard enough to pay your monthly bills, gas has now gone up. This leaves less wiggle room in your budget. It also makes you think: How can I cut my fuel costs?

While we could give you tips like driving less and riding your bike more to cut fuel costs, that may not be feasible for your lifestyle. Instead, here are some tips to keep using your car as usual while paying as little for gasoline as possible.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How To Save on Gas</h3>
<h4>Get GasBuddy or Waze</h4>
If you’re not using apps to save cash, now’s the time to start, especially when it comes to gas.
Apps like GasBuddy and Waze can help you find which gas stations have the cheapest fuel, versus having to drive around town and do your own research.

While being able to pinpoint the cheapest gas stations is great, GasBuddy even allows you to earn “GasBack” with each purchase.
<h4>Pay With Cash</h4>
Those huge signs outside of gas stations show how much you can save by paying with cash versus a card. This is one of the easiest ways to pay less for fuel, even though it may be a bit inconvenient if you’re in a hurry.

While many gas stations have one set of prices for cash purchases versus cards, some may let you get that cash discount with a debit card. Ask for clarification before paying to see those instant savings.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Pay With a Rewards Credit Card</h4>
If paying with cash isn’t your thing and you need to use a card, make it one that gives you rewards points or cash back. To avoid interest charges, pay off your balance each month.

On a similar note, you may want to look into joining a fuel rewards program if you go to the same gas station every time. These programs offer savings to build customer loyalty, and you can end up laying a lot less per gallon.
<h4>Use the Right Fuel</h4>
Do some cars require premium gasoline? Absolutely, and if yours is one of them, fill up with premium to avoid any mechanical problems. But if your car manufacturer says that regular gas is okay, fill up with that. There’s no need to pay 40 cents more per gallon for gas that won’t do much for your car.

Buy at the Beginning of the Week

You can save money per gallon according to when you buy gas. The best days to buy are Mondays and Tuesdays, while the most expensive ones are Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute</h4>
When your gas tank is empty, you can’t really shop around, as you’ll need to buy from the nearest gas station to avoid being stranded on the side of the road.

A family rarely gets to stay in place forever. For many reasons, you may be forced to move to a new location, which can stop whatever stability you enjoyed. What can make things worse? The costs associated with moving, and worries about how you’ll adapt to your new environment.

One thing that could make it very hard to adapt is losing your Section 8 voucher. Since it can take years to secure one, losing it when moving is the last thing you want to happen. Luckily, you can transfer a housing voucher, as long as you follow certain rules.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

We’ll discuss the basics of how to transfer a voucher. But before we do, let’s talk about the costs of moving.
<h4>Potential Costs To Consider Before Moving</h4>
If you’re moving to relocate for a new job or send your kids to a better school, you may not have much choice. But if you’re only moving because you’re bored with where you are and need a change of scenery, your choice may be impacted by all of these potential costs.
In short, they may change your mind about moving:
<ul>
 	<li>Taking time off work</li>
 	<li>Application fees</li>
 	<li>Background checks</li>
 	<li>New appliances</li>
 	<li>New furniture</li>
 	<li>Utility costs</li>
 	<li>Security deposits</li>
 	<li>Finding a new babysitter or daycare</li>
 	<li>Cleaning supplies/services</li>
 	<li>Storage</li>
 	<li>Truck rentals</li>
 	<li>Gasoline</li>
 	<li>Temporary lodging/hotels</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Even with Section 8 help, you could see higher out-of-pocket rent costs. This can happen with rent overlap, where you move into a new place, but your old lease is still active. You’ll have to pay the rent at the new place until your voucher kicks in.
<h4>How To Transfer Your Housing Voucher</h4>
If the costs above don’t dissuade you from moving, here’s what you’ll need to do to transfer your Section 8 voucher:
<ol>
 	<li>Notify your Public Housing Agency (PHA) about your intentions to move. This usually involves requesting a transfer packet that contains the paperwork necessary to transfer a voucher to a different location.</li>
 	<li>Notify your landlord of your intentions by giving them 30 to 60 days' notice. You should be able to find a form for this in your transfer packet from the PHA. You and the landlord will need to sign it and give a copy to the PHA.</li>
 	<li>Disclose any changes regarding your family composition. You may be losing or adding family members when moving. This can affect your voucher, so you’ll need to report any such changes to the PHA.</li>
 	<li>Complete an interview with the PHA. They will review your transfer packet and confirm that all of the information is correct.</li>
 	<li>If all goes as planned, you will get your new voucher that can be used to make your new home’s rent more affordable.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Possible Obstacles To Transferring Your Section 8 Voucher</h4>
You’ll need to make sure your new home complies with Section 8 standards. In other words, it’ll need to be affordable compared to other rentals in the area, and it must pass inspection. But even if your new home is deemed suitable by the PHA, the following could prevent you from transferring your voucher:
<ul>
 	<li>Any violations of Section 8 rules.</li>
 	<li>Owing money to the PHA or landlord.</li>
 	<li>Being stuck in a lease with the current landlord that you can’t get out of.</li>
</ul>","There’s good news if you need to move: You may be able to bring your Section 8 housing voucher with you to keep rent affordable wherever you go.

3481,"Section 8 Violations That Can Cause You To Forfeit Your Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What does it take to get a Section 8 housing voucher? Here’s the process in a nutshell:
<ol>
 	<li>You get in touch with your local PHA (Public Housing Agency).</li>
 	<li>You begin the application process.</li>
 	<li>The PHA checks to ensure you meet eligibility requirements for income, citizenship, etc.</li>
 	<li>You get approved/rejected for a Housing Choice Voucher.</li>
 	<li>If approved, you get moved to a waiting list.</li>
 	<li>Once your spot comes up, you get your voucher.</li>
 	<li>You use your voucher to pay part of the rent at a property you choose.</li>
 	<li>You remain a tenant by abiding by the landlord’s and PHA’s rules.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

As you can see, there are several steps in the Section 8 process. And the fifth one – sitting on the waiting list – can take the longest. Since a Housing Choice Voucher can pay the majority of your rent, such housing assistance is in high demand. Combine that with limited funds, and you could be sitting on a waiting list for a year or longer.

Does getting a voucher mean you’re 100 percent in the clear? No, because even if you’re patient and wait years to get it, you can lose it quickly. How? By committing any of these violations that can lead to the forfeiture of your voucher via the PHA:
<h3>Section 8 Violations to Avoid</h3>
<h4>1. Criminal activity, especially if it’s drug-related or violent.</h4>
Not much explanation is needed here.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Disturbances.</h4>
You’ll be expected to act as a good tenant and neighbor wherever you move with your voucher.
This expectation will likely be outlined in your lease with the landlord, as well as with the PHA and the Section 8 rules they’re responsible for enforcing.
<h4>3. Not obeying rules in your lease.</h4>
Disturbances are just one thing your lease will tell you to avoid. Whatever else is agreed upon between you and your landlord, you must stick to. If you don’t, the landlord could cause issues with the PHA that could lead them to stop assistance.
<h4>4. Damaging the property.</h4>
You’ll need to maintain the property in good condition. If you, household members, or guests damage the property, you’ll have to complete repairs in a timely fashion to avoid losing assistance.
<h4>5. Hiding income.</h4>
Section 8 housing vouchers are meant as a way to help low-income families. As such, you’ll need to disclose household income to initially qualify and maintain your voucher. If you hide your income, you could be guilty of fraud and lose your assistance.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>6. Not reporting changes in family composition.</h4>
Income is just one thing you must disclose to the PHA. You’ll also need to update them on any changes to your household composition, whether it’s adding or subtracting family members. The composition can affect your voucher, which is why updates are a must if you wish to continue receiving assistance.
<h4>7. Failure to pay rent.</h4>
Each month, the PHA will pay your voucher’s portion of the rent directly to your landlord. You’re responsible for paying your portion. If you do not, you could lose your voucher.
<h4>8. Getting evicted.</h4>
If your landlord decides to evict you, the PHA could terminate your assistance. For this reason, it’s in your best interest to maintain a solid relationship with your landlord by paying rent on time, avoiding disturbances, etc.","Getting a Section 8 voucher could take years, depending on where you live.

What can a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher give you? The peace of mind knowing that you don’t have to pay so much of your income towards the rent anymore. How can it do this? By paying some of your rent directly to your landlord, while you pay the rest.

With a Section 8 voucher, you can rest easy knowing you’ll only pay around 30 percent of your income in rent. This is excellent news if you’ve always had trouble paying the rent on time, have faced eviction, or have lived on the streets.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the downside to Section 8? The fact that the program is so popular. Funding is limited, while demand for Housing Choice Vouchers is through the roof. Depending on where you live, you could find yourself sitting on a waiting list for a year or longer. In short, don’t count on Section 8 for emergency rental assistance, as it’s meant to be more of a long-term solution.

Now, if you’d like to fix your rent issues in the long run so you can get some much-needed stability for you and your family, Section 8 can help. But since the demand’s so high and the wait can be potentially long, you’ll want to do your homework before wasting your time.

We’ll help you with a bit of that homework now, as here are some basic hurdles you’ll have to jump through to be a Section 8 candidate:
<h4>Criminal History</h4>
Can you be a felon or on parole and get Section 8 assistance? Believe it or not, the answer is yes, depending on your Public Housing Agency (PHA). They’ll run background checks to look at your past, but some have more lenient rules that could allow you in the door despite a criminal record.

It’s worth noting that you can have a criminal record, but certain red flags could disqualify you automatically. They are:

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<ol>
 	<li>Placement on the lifelong sex offender registry.</li>
 	<li>Conviction for producing methamphetamine within federal housing.</li>
 	<li>Eviction within the last three years due to drugs.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Immigration Status</h4>
At least one person in the Section 8 applicant’s household must have legal immigration status. This is very important, as some believe that every household member must have such status.

What happens if you’re in a mixed household regarding immigration status? If approved, your voucher will only apply to those with that status. In short, you may receive less money for your rent.
<h4>Income</h4>
Check the income limits for your area. You’ll have to meet them to qualify for Section 8. If you’re concerned that you make too much, keep in mind that the more people in your household, the higher income that’s allowed. Only low-income families are eligible for Section 8, as it’s meant to help those with the greatest needs.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Location</h4>
Think long and hard about where you want to live. Whatever you decide on, that’s the location where you’ll need to apply to. You can find Public Housing Agencies all across the U.S. by going <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.","You won’t get Section 8 assistance overnight, as the demand is too high.

What can affordable housing provide you and your family? For starters, it can give you stability, so you don’t have to move continually. Your kids can stay in the same school and hang out with their close friends. You can continue to work. And stability can also lead to other benefits, such as improved health via reduced stress.

With affordable housing, you have more money for other living expenses. It’s easier to pay for healthcare. You can buy more food, so your family gets the nutrition they need.
And so on.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

How can you get affordable housing? Besides living in a location that’s cheap or choosing a home that’s small and easy to maintain, affordable housing can be had with a Section 8 voucher.

A voucher reduces your out-of-pocket rent costs. It limits how much you have to pay per month in rent, which is usually capped at around 30 percent of your income. The remainder of the rent gets delivered to your landlord by the government, which gives you significant savings and that aforementioned stability and the benefits it brings.

At this point, you probably think a voucher can alleviate most of your financial problems.
But there is one downside to Section 8: It’s limited. Not only are funds scarce, but the demand for Section 8 is high. Combine those two, and it’s no wonder why it can be hard to get approved.

Even if you are approved for Section 8, what comes next is a wait. And depending on where you want to live, that wait could exceed a year until you finally get your voucher.

Now that you see the time commitment involved with the Section 8 process, let’s look at how you can start applying, so you don’t have to wait as long for rental assistance.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Steps To Start the Section 8 Application Process</h4>
1. Your first step is to get in touch with the Public Housing Agency (PHA) where you’d like to live. They will handle your application, determine your eligibility, and disburse your voucher if you are accepted.

The PHA can help you learn more about Section 8, as well as kickstart your application. The sooner you contact them, the better.

2. You may be able to accelerate the process by applying to different waitlists. To do this, make a list of places where you could see yourself living for a year. After a year, you can move and transfer your voucher.

Once you have your list of multiple locations, contact PHAs nearby. You may run into a snag with some waitlists being closed. To combat this, ask the PHA if they have an alert system so you can be notified when the waitlists open. Once they do, apply quickly to earn your spot in line.

3. When you apply, be sure to use a stable mailing address. In other words, don’t use an address if you know you’ll be on the move always or nobody will be able to check the mail.

PHAs send out correspondence, and you’ll need to stay on top of them to avoid any delays. If you have trouble with this step, ask a friend or family for help. You may be able to use their address. Some shelters or churches in your area may also offer such a service.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

4. A doctor’s note could help you move faster through the waitlist if someone in your home has a disability or other health problems. Don’t forget to use this to your advantage.

5. Never pay to apply for Section 8. It’s free. The same holds for when you make the waitlist. Do not pay someone to advance you through the line, as it’s a scam.","Getting a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher isn’t impossible.

3490,"Have You Taken The Right Steps To Apply For Section 8?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The thought of only having to pay around 30 percent of your income towards rent may be so appealing that you can’t wait to apply for Section 8. It’s a lengthy process, though. And Section 8 is not emergency rental assistance that you’ll get within a few days, weeks, or probably even months.

As such, you want to make sure you apply for a Housing Choice Voucher correctly. Answer these questions to ensure you do just that:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Do you know where you want to live?</h4>
With Section 8, you aren’t limited to living in your current city. There are Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) all across the U.S., so you can take your voucher almost anywhere.

Keeping this in mind, you should make a list of places you’d like to live before applying for Section 8. Why? Because you’ll need to apply to the PHA that coincides with your potential destination. If you don’t, you could get stuck with a voucher that has you live in a city that doesn’t fit your needs.

Another reason to make a list of potential locations is to reduce time on the Section 8 waiting list. Some areas have a high demand for vouchers, making the wait much longer than other less popular locations.

Your best bet is to apply to different waiting lists and PHAs to see which produces a voucher the quickest. If you can tough it out in one city for your voucher’s first year, you can transfer to a new location later on.
<h4>2. Do you have an email address?</h4>
Although it’s 2021, some people still do not have email addresses. If you’re one of them, get one for free via Gmail or a similar service. You’ll need the email address to apply for Section 8.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Do you have a reliable mailing address?</h4>
This is crucial to have a successful Section 8 journey, as your PHA will send correspondence from time to time. If you miss a letter and don’t respond in time, you could delay your voucher even more or lose your spot on the waiting list.

Pick a friend or family member’s mailing address if you’re always on the go. Or you can ask your nearest shelter or church if they can accept your mail. Whatever address you pick, make sure you check the mail regularly.
<h4>4. Are you getting housing alerts?</h4>
Some PHAs open and close their waiting lists according to changes in demand. You’ll want to receive alerts on when these lists open so you can be one of the first people to apply. You can ask your PHA if they offer such a service.
<h4>5. Are you falling for a scam?</h4>
If someone tells you there’s a fee to apply for Section 8, move on. It’s free to apply, so don’t fall for any scams.
<h4>6. Does anyone in your household have a disability or medical issues?</h4>
If so, a doctor’s note could move you up the list and get you a voucher quicker. Don’t forget to use this to your advantage, as it’s one of the best ways to accelerate the Section 8 application process.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Have you contacted the PHA yet?</h4>
If you haven’t done this once you finish everything in the list above, now’s the time to do so. Contacting the PHA is how you begin the Housing Choice Voucher application process.","You may be in a rush to apply for a Section 8 voucher so you can get help paying the rent.

3493,"Don’t Forget To Do This Once You’re On A Section 8 Waitlist","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What’s your main goal when applying for Section 8? Getting a Housing Choice Voucher. Why? Because it can pay the majority of your rent, while you only have to pay around 30 percent of your income to the landlord. And while getting that voucher is your main Section 8 goal, here’s what you’ll need to do before that happens: Make the waitlist.

What’s so special about the waitlist? It signifies that you qualify for Section 8, and that you passed a significant hurdle on the way to making rent affordable. But don’t let the name “waitlist” fool you, as you’ll need to take action to ensure you get that voucher in the end.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here’s a list of things you should do once you’re put on the Section 8 waiting list, according to experts on the topic:
<h4>Keep an Eye Out for Correspondence</h4>
Your Public Housing Agency (PHA) will be in charge of disbursing your Section 8 voucher. Throughout the process, they may send you correspondence about your application that you must respond to promptly. If you don’t, you could run into delays with your voucher's processing, or you could lose your spot on the waitlist.

Whether it’s via phone, email, or in your mailbox, keep an eye out for anything your PHA tries to send you. The quicker you respond, the better.
<h4>Keep Detailed Records of Everything</h4>
Besides watching out for and responding to the PHA correspondence, you’ll need to document everything to ensure the process goes smoothly. The main reason for this is that some PHAs have heavy turnover, so your application could get lost in the mix.

Keep separate files for anything related to your voucher application. It’s a good idea to take pictures of everything too.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Give the PHA Updated Information</h4>
Even though you may be approved for a Housing Choice Voucher and are on a waiting list, you’ll need to provide updates to the PHA. For instance, if your household income changes, you move, or your family composition changes, you’ll need to let them know.
<h4>Don’t Stop Applying</h4>
Just because you make one waitlist doesn’t mean you should put all of your eggs in that basket. To increase your chances of getting a voucher quicker, apply to other waitlists as soon as they open up. It’s a numbers game, so the more waitlists you apply to, the better your chances of finally getting that voucher.
<h4>Talk To Others in Your Position</h4>
The Internet makes it easy to connect with others dealing with your same issues. Use this to your advantage and join some Section 8 groups online. You can look for Facebook Groups on the topic, as well as message boards. By connecting online, you can learn tips and tricks on Section 8, share your experiences, and gain some much-needed support.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Be Patient</h4>
Section 8 is not emergency rental assistance. Depending on your location, your Section 8 wait could take years. Remember this, and don’t get frustrated. No matter how long the delay, it’ll be worth it once you have your voucher and can start saving significant money on rent.","Making the Section 8 waitlist doesn’t mean you should just sit around and wait.

3496,"How To Find Affordable Housing With Your Section 8 Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

How much of your income is going directly to your landlord each month? If you’re like many, the answer is too much.

It’s not uncommon for someone to spend over half of their monthly income towards housing, making it impossible to start an emergency fund, pay down debt, or achieve other financial goals.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

With a Section 8 voucher, though, you won’t have to worry about spending so much. Why? Because your out-of-pocket rent expenses will hover around just 30 percent of your income.
And those are significant savings over having to pay it all yourself.

How can you get a Section 8 voucher? That process begins by figuring out where you want to live, then contacting the Public Housing Agency (PHA) in that area.

Once you apply for a Housing Choice Voucher, you’ll have to wait for approval. And once you get approved, you’ll be moved to a waiting list that could take over a year to process, depending on the number of vouchers available and the demand.

What comes next? Reaching your spot on the waiting list, which means it’s time to finally receive your voucher. And once you have it, here’s what to do so you use it properly:

<h4>1. Know your limits.</h4>
Several factors determine your voucher amount, such as location, family size, etc. These factors will determine the size limit, which is the number of bedrooms the home can have. You’ll need to know this number, as well as the rent range for your voucher. With those two bits of info, you can look for a home that fits your needs and is affordable.

The voucher should tell you the size limit. For the price range, you’ll probably need to contact your PHA and ask. Do this before searching for properties, as you don’t want to waste your time picking something you won’t be able to afford.

Don’t forget about utilities either. Some families have picked homes they thought were affordable, only to realize they can’t pay their portion of the utility bill each month. This can lead to electricity shutoffs, credit issues, and more. Ask the landlord how much utilities are monthly, and ask the PHA if you have a utility allowance.

<h4>2. Know where to look.</h4>
With your home size and price range in mind, you can begin looking for Section 8 properties to rent. The HUD Resource Locator is a handy tool for finding such properties, or you can use sites like Zillow, the Facebook Marketplace, Rently, etc. Remember that your voucher lets you rent different properties, including single-family homes, townhomes, and apartments.

<h4>3. Take notes.</h4>
Whenever you visit a property, take detailed notes on the address, landlord, property type, etc. If you get discriminated against, this information will come in handy.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Don’t forget your security deposit.</h4>
You’ll have to pay this out of pocket if you can’t find security deposit assistance in your state. Your voucher will not cover it, so be sure to save up, so you don’t hit any snags.

<h4>5. Review the lease with your PHA.</h4>
Ask a member of your PHA if they can read over a landlord’s lease before you sign it. If everything’s okay, sign all of the paperwork, and don’t forget to give the PHA a copy.","A Section 8 voucher holds the key to affordable housing.

Then keep reading, as these resources could be what you need to fix those issues so you can get back on your feet.

Last year when the coronavirus was introduced, did you ever imagine that we would still be wearing masks, socially distancing, and be kept from doing many of the things we love?
Probably not, but that’s our reality. And depending on where you look, it appears as if a life filled with COVID-19 restrictions will be our reality, at least into the near future.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

With COVID-19 still in the mix, trying to recover from its negative financial impact remains complicated. Finding a job can be more challenging than ever, and you still have to factor in safety issues.

What’s your best move then? It’s not taking out a constant stream of personal loans or using credit cards that will put you deeper into debt. And it’s not asking family and friends for help, as they’ve all been impacted as well. Instead, you should use the following resources that can offer assistance with fixing many of your pandemic-related issues. Remember to share them with your loved ones as well:
<h4>Information on Getting Vaccines and Staying Safe</h4>
Safety is the number one priority, because we won’t be around much longer without our health. As such, bookmark these two websites:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Your state’s health department website</a> – It can tell you where to get a COVID-19 vaccine in your area to offer an extra layer of protection against the virus.</li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The CDC’s website</a> – Use it to learn more about vaccines, coronavirus safety, and where we are in the fight to defeat the pandemic.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Help With Housing and Utilities</h4>
To stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, you need a roof over your head. You also need to keep the lights on, which is why you should do the following:
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://legalfaq.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Use this site</a> to see the status of evictions in your state. Doing so will show you what protections renters have during the pandemic, which is crucial when dealing with your landlord.</li>
 	<li>Contact your nearest Public Housing Agency. Tell them your housing situation so they can fill you in on short and long-term assistance options.</li>
 	<li>Contact your utility company and ask how you can make your bill more manageable to avoid shutoffs. See if you’re eligible for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) too. It can reduce your monthly out-of-pocket utility costs.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Unemployment Assistance</h4>
The job loss caused by COVID-19 is staggering. If someone in your household lost their job due to the coronavirus, applying for Unemployment Insurance through your state can help replace some of that income.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Assistance With Bills, Food, Healthcare, Etc.</h4>
If you’re looking for a one-stop-shop for coronavirus assistance, dialing 211 on your phone may be just what the doctor ordered.

A quick call and chat with a local operator can fix issues you’re having with finding food, getting affordable healthcare, paying your bills, and more.","Are you still reeling from all of the financial problems the coronavirus pandemic has caused?

3504,"You Need Home Internet More Than Ever. Here’s How To Get It Cheap","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The coronavirus caused many of us to change our everyday lives. Offices were closed, and employees were told to work from home. And schools shuttered, forcing students to study online.

What do these shifts require for both you and your children to be successful? Internet service. But that can be difficult to afford if you’re on a tight budget, especially in these challenging times.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

To get affordable home Internet, so you don’t skip a beat, try one of the following providers:
<h4>Access from AT&amp;T</h4>
Eligible households can enjoy low-cost Internet from AT&amp;T’s Access program. If you qualify, you could get service for less than $10 per month with speeds up to 25Mbps.

This service includes free installation, so you can get your WiFi set up by a professional. No deposit is required either, nor do you have to sign an annual contract.

Due to the coronavirus, AT&amp;T has made it easier to qualify for Access. They’ve also waived home Internet data overage fees since families will need to be online more often.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Internet Essentials from Comcast</h4>
What does it take to get Internet from Comcast for just $9.95 per month plus tax? Being eligible for some other form of public assistance, such as SSI, SNAP, housing assistance, Medicaid, or the National School Lunch Program.

Internet Essentials can give you affordable Internet with no credit check or long-term contract. And due to the coronavirus, Comcast has decided to provide new customers two free months of service.
<h4>Mediacom Connect 2 Compete</h4>
Here’s cheap Internet made with students in mind. To get discounted Internet from Mediacom, your child will need to qualify for free or reduced lunches via the National School Lunch Program. As with other offers in this list, Connect 2 Compete can get you connected for a low price of just $9.95 per month plus tax.

Besides being affordable, Mediacom’s Internet also comes with no strings attached. You won’t have to worry about installation fees, equipment rental fees, a contract, or a deposit.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Verizon Lifeline</h4>
The Lifeline Discount Program from Verizon is a bit pricier than others on this list. However, it may suit you better if you or your children need super-high Internet speeds that come via Verizon’s fiber-optic network.

With Lifeline, you can save $20 per month on fiber-optic Internet. This can get you speeds of 200Mbps for $19.99 per month, plus taxes and equipment charges.

Is paying double for this service worth it? That depends. But if your family is using the Internet for entertainment in addition to studying and working, Lifeline may be your best bet.
<h4>Contact Your Existing Provider</h4>
If you already have Internet, but would like to pay less for service, contact your existing provider.
Like other industries, many Internet providers have made changes in response to the pandemic. Explain your situation and need for a more affordable service, and they may offer a discount to make this now necessary expense more manageable.","You may find yourself needing home Internet for work or your children’s school due to COVID-19.

3507,"See How Much Your Coronavirus Stimulus Checks Are Worth","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Last year was filled with bad news, and most of it was related to the coronavirus. The pandemic brought with it plenty of illness and financial destruction, so it was nice to get a bit of good news when it was announced that stimulus checks were on the way.

We’ve now had two rounds of stimulus checks from the government. If you’re missing a payment, we’ll reveal why that might be the case. And we’ll also discuss how your payment is calculated, so you aren’t hit with any surprises.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Coronavirus Economic Impact Payments</h4>
Whether you call them stimulus checks or Economic Impact Payments does not matter. What matters is how much you’re getting and when.

You should have received the first round of stimulus payments by now since they were announced in March 2020. That set of checks had the following payout structure:
<ul>
 	<li>$1,200 to each eligible adult.</li>
 	<li>$500 to each dependent child.</li>
</ul>
So, let’s say you have a family of four with two adults and two kids. Your stimulus payment would equal:

$1,200 + $1,200 + $500 + $500 = $3,400

The more eligible people in your household, the higher the payment.

What about the second round of stimulus checks? Some people claim that they still haven’t received those as of yet. Since they were authorized in December 2020, you should have gotten yours. Here’s the payment structure for the second set of stimulus payments:
<ul>
 	<li>$600 to each eligible adult.</li>
 	<li>$600 to each dependent child.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

As you can see, the payouts went down, with adults getting half the amount released in the first stimulus, although children got a little $100 bump.

For the same family of four, your second stimulus payment would equal:

$600 + $600 + $600 + $600 = $2,400

Now for the critical question: If you haven’t received that second stimulus check yet, where is it?
First, you need to know where to look, as the payments were sent out via mail or direct deposit.

If yours was sent by mail, you can expect a check or a prepaid debit card. And if it’s a direct deposit, it’ll go to the same bank account where you’ve received federal benefits or your tax refund.

Speaking of tax refunds, that’s a big reason why you may not have received your stimulus payment. You’ll need to file a 2020 tax return to get paid, even if you never file because you aren’t required to do so. MyFreeTaxes will help you get that done at no cost.

Beyond not filing a return or simply getting lost in the mix, another reason why your payment hasn’t arrived is because you’re not eligible.

To qualify for COVID-19 stimulus payments, you’ll need to meet the following requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>U.S. citizen or resident alien.</li>
 	<li>Valid Social Security number.</li>
 	<li>Not a dependent listed on someone else’s taxes.</li>
 	<li>Adjusted gross income below $75,000, $112,500, or $150,000 for an individual, head of household, or married couple filing jointly.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

And if you’ve received what you believe to be a low payment, that could be due to earning more than those income limits. You can make up to $99,000, $136,500, or $198,000 as an individual, head of household, or married couple and still receive a reduced stimulus payment.

If you’re still confused about why your payment is missing, contact the 211 Economic Impact Payment Helpline at 844-322-3639 or speak to an IRS-certified volunteer.","Are you still waiting on your coronavirus stimulus payment? Are you wondering how much it will be?

3510,"How To Stop Overpaying For Bills, Especially During The Pandemic","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may have had trouble paying your bills before the coronavirus appeared. Now that the pandemic is in full swing, paying those same bills may seem impossible.

To make things worse, you were forced to stay at home. And that probably caused your electric, water, gas, and other bills to go up due to increased usage.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

The good news is that you’re certainly not alone if your bills are piling up. Even better, there are ways to reduce your bills so they become more manageable.
<h3>How to Reduce Your Bills During the Pandemic</h3>
<h4>1. Tackle them head-on.</h4>
What won’t fix your bill-paying problems? Tossing your bills in a drawer and ignoring them whenever they come in the mail.

Let’s look at your electricity bill as an example. Even though there were new laws put in place to prevent shutoffs with the pandemic, some of those have expired. If you don’t pay your bill, your power could get shut off, leaving your family in the dark.

What happens once the power is off? Your utility company could charge you a fee to get it turned back on, and the reconnection fees alone could put a big dent in your bank account. That’s not all, though, as you could also be forced to leave a deposit just to get reconnected, which adds to your out-of-pocket expenses.

Even if you can’t pay your bills, tackle the problem head-on by contacting your providers. There’s no need to feel intimidated or embarrassed, as once again, you’re not alone and many are having similar problems due to COVID-19.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Ask the company if they have discounts or payment plans. Let them know you’re having financial issues. They should respond with any programs they have available, or they could connect you with local organizations that specialize in providing such assistance.
<h4>2. Get help.</h4>
Speaking of local organizations that offer utility assistance, help with paying bills, and more, you can find them by dialing 211 on your phone. A local operator will tell you who to get in contact with, depending on your problem.

You can call this number for help with housing, bills, food, healthcare, and more. It’s a great way to fix financial issues and find quick assistance while the coronavirus still lingers. Depending on your location, your 211 operator could connect you with the following groups:
<ul>
 	<li>Catholic Charities</li>
 	<li>Love Inc.</li>
 	<li>Lutheran Social Ministry</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army</li>
 	<li>Urban League</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Apply for LIHEAP.</h4>
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program can reduce your heating and cooling costs, which can make your utility bill a lot cheaper. <a href=""https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/low-income-home-energy-assistance-program-liheap"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Click here</a> to learn more about this utility assistance program and see if you qualify.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Get $10 Internet.</h4>
If you have kids or work from home, you may now see the Internet as an absolute necessity. Since you can’t cut it from your budget completely, you should do everything you can to pay less for Internet each month.

Here are various programs that can give you fast, reliable Internet for as little as $9.95 per month:
<ul>
 	<li>Comcast Internet Essentials</li>
 	<li>Verizon Lifeline</li>
 	<li>Access from AT&amp;T</li>
 	<li>Mediacom Connect 2 Compete</li>
 	<li>EveryoneOn</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Lower your cell and landline bills.</h4>
The Lifeline program from the FCC offers low-cost landline and cell phone service. You may even qualify for a free phone, which can be put to use while you keep in touch with your loved ones while the coronavirus keeps you separated.","Now’s not the time to have expensive bills coming in the mail.

Has the pandemic left you scrambling for money to find food? Before you stress another second, try using these five tools to find food assistance fast.

If life was stressful before the coronavirus, it’s even worse now, especially if you lost your job due to the shutdowns. Even if you had several months of expenses saved up in an emergency fund, that’s probably gone now since we’re about a year into the pandemic. And while we did get a bit of help through some stimulus payments, those certainly weren’t built to last either.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What can you do when your family needs food, and you’re out of money? Besides asking for help from friends and family or taking out an expensive personal loan, you can find food assistance that can fill your nutritional needs at no cost. Let’s look at some food assistance resources right now that can save the day while we combat COVID-19:
<h4>1. The National Hunger Hotline</h4>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture created this hotline to help low-income families find food when times get tough. Give it a call today, and you can quickly find food banks, meal sites, and more in your area without having to do any research on your own.

The Hunger Hotline operates Monday through Friday from 7 am to 10 pm Eastern Time. For English, call 866-3-HUNGRY. For Spanish, call 877-8-HAMBRE.

You can also text the Hunger Hotline to get an automated response. Text 97779 along with a question that contains a relevant keyword, such as “meals” or “food” to get the info you’re seeking.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. USDA Find Meals For Kids</h4>
Depending on where you live, schools may be closed in your area. If your kids previously relied on free or reduced-price meals from school, this can negatively impact their nutrition.

To help kids stay fed during the pandemic, the USDA created a Find Meals For Kids site that you can use to see where school meals are being distributed. Just <a href=""https://usda-fns.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=789a7a56a07f4e3dab873fd8c2918f9a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">click here</a> and use the map to find all of the schools near you.
<h4>3. Meals On Wheels Finder</h4>
While keeping kids fed during the pandemic is crucial, so is filling the nutritional needs of seniors. Meals on Wheels does this with over 5,000 programs spread across the country, and you can <a href=""https://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/find-meals"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">use this handy tool</a> to find one near you by simply entering your zip code.
<h4>4. FoodFinder</h4>
You probably know that a food pantry can help when you require emergency assistance because your kitchen is empty. But do you know where actual food pantries are?

You may not know, which can add confusion to an already stressful situation. That’s why using the <a href=""https://foodfinder.us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FoodFinder tool</a> is a must if your family lacks food right now, as it can show you where pantries are nearby so you can visit one today.

Just enter your zip code, and the map will show you all of the food pantries nearby, so you never have to wonder where nutritional assistance is the next time you run into an emergency.

<h4>5. 211</h4>
It can be overwhelming trying to find food when you’re stressed, and your family is starving.
While the tools above help pinpoint food banks and the like, you may want to speak to someone instead.

3523,"A Crash Course On Homeless Motel Vouchers","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>What Is a Homeless Motel Voucher?</h4>
A motel voucher for the homeless gives someone the chance to enjoy privacy, safety, and sanitary conditions a shelter usually cannot provide. With a homeless voucher, you can sleep in a hotel or motel without having to pay for it. The agency often picks the lodging.

In cases where homeless housing resources are very limited, a voucher may be used to offer lodging at a local shelter or in public housing. This may be more common in large cities with a massive homeless population.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Who Provides Hotel Vouchers to the Homeless?</h4>
Nonprofits and other agencies offer this service. They usually do so by holding fundraisers.
<h4>Are Homeless Hotel Vouchers Easy to Get?</h4>
Unfortunately, high demand and limited supply make hotel vouchers challenging to come by. This comes as no surprise when you consider the ever-growing homeless population and the costs involved with paying for separate hotel or motel rooms using primarily donations.
<h4>How Long Do Motel Vouchers Last?</h4>
The typical length of a hotel/motel stay with a voucher is three nights. That obviously isn’t a lot of time, which is why you should view a hotel voucher as a temporary solution to your homelessness. And while getting to sleep in your own hotel or motel room is ideal, the temporary nature of these vouchers suggests that you should prioritize more long-term housing solutions.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How Can You Get a Hotel Voucher if You’re Homeless?</h4>
While getting a hotel voucher can be tricky due to limited availability, it’s not impossible. You will probably have to do a bit of legwork, though, and contact several resources to have luck.

You can begin by contacting your local Salvation Army and Catholic Charities. You can also speak to a local operator well-versed in helping the homeless by dialing 211 on your phone.

Other common resources the homeless use to find hotel vouchers include local shelters or assistance programs, which you can find by clicking here.
<h4>Are Hotel Vouchers Open to Anyone Who’s Homeless?</h4>
Due to their limited availability, homeless vouchers are sometimes reserved for special situations, such as victims of disaster or domestic violence. You may also move to the front of the hotel voucher list in some cases if you are a single parent, single male, senior, or disabled.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>What Do You Do After You Get Your Homeless Hotel Voucher?</h4>
Besides using the hotel or motel room to collect your thoughts and get some much-needed rest, you may have to follow some rules from the agency that gave you the voucher. The agency may require you to check in. You may have to attend a counseling session to see how you can end your homeless situation. You may also have to show that you’re making an effort to find work if you’re not currently employed.","Who can get a homeless motel voucher and where can you find it?

If you’re scared of needles, you may be wondering if a flu shot is really necessary. And while you could live without it, there are two primary benefits to getting the flu vaccine yearly:
<ul>
 	<li>It can help prevent the flu.</li>
 	<li>If you get the flu, it can lessen the symptoms.</li>
</ul>
Both young and old can get the flu vaccine, as the CDC recommends it for anyone over six months. While it’s too late to get your shot during the peak months of September and October, getting vaccinated up to April or May can still provide your body the protection it needs versus the illness.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Where to Get Free or Low-Cost Flu Shots</h4>
What can keep you from getting a flu shot? Besides the aforementioned fear of needles, a lack of insurance can stop you in your tracks.

Luckily, flu shots aren’t that expensive, even without insurance. And while they could cost you a few bucks out of pocket, you’ll have to factor in how much money you could lose by taking time off of work, buying flu medicine, etc., should you get sick from not having the vaccine.

With that being said, let’s look at the best places for getting the flu vaccination. Since they may vary in terms of supply, call ahead of time to make sure they have a shot waiting for you.
<h4>Doctor’s Office and Urgent Care Clinics</h4>
Either of these options can get you vaccinated against the flu for free if you have insurance. They may charge you for the visit, though, so call first to confirm your overall cost.
<h4>Community Health Centers</h4>
These centers are located all across the country to provide affordable healthcare to those who need it most. If you lack insurance and live on minimal income, you could get free flu shots at your nearest community health center, which you can find <a href=""https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Your Workplace</h4>
Unless you’ve been moved to a work-at-home arrangement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you could get vaccinated at your workplace. To find out if this option is available, get in touch with your company’s human resources department.
<h4>Your College Campus</h4>
Although many college campuses have closed due to the coronavirus, some are still open. On-campus students may be eligible for free flu shot vaccinations with their student IDs.
<h4>VA Health Center</h4>
If you’re a veteran, you may find free flu shots at one of the following, provided you’re part of the VA healthcare system:
<ul>
 	<li>VA healthcare facilities</li>
 	<li>In-network retail pharmacies</li>
 	<li>Urgent care clinics</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stores and Pharmacies</h4>
Here are several stores and pharmacies that offer flu shots. Most allow walk-ins, while some may require appointments to get vaccinated.
If you don’t have insurance, you can still get your shot for as little as $19.99, depending on where you go.

3553,"See Why The American Families Plan Is Investing Billions In Education","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The government under President Biden is wasting no time in sending help to those who need it most. It all started with the American Rescue Plan that became official in March of this year. Once the President signed it into law, the plan's benefits started to appear in everyday life.

Not only did we start to receive $1,400 stimulus payments to help ease financial burden and pay the bills, but we also saw vaccine availability skyrocket to protect against COVID-19.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

And if you’re a parent who’s been negatively impacted by having your kids at home all this time, this is the benefit you probably loved most: Seeing schools start to reopen at a faster pace.

Although it seems as if the American Rescue Plan was and continues to be a hit, there could be even more relief on the way. President Biden recently revealed his next goal, which is the approval of the American Families Plan. While the plan offers massive investments in making health insurance, food, and other necessities more accessible, let’s look at how it could make education a lot more affordable.
<h4>Universal Pre-school - $200 billion</h4>
The need for affordable education starts at an early age. Three and four-year-olds would enjoy free, high-quality pre-school under the American Families Plan, thanks to a $200 billion investment. In doing so, it would level the playing field between low-income and higher-income families so that no children are left behind.

How much could this save parents if the American Families Plan gets signed into law? An average of $13,000 per year, which is critical for households where every dollar counts.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

As mentioned, universal pre-school would not only offer free education for young children, but it would make sure it’s of high quality. To achieve this goal, the American Families plan will incentivize people to study early childhood education via free community college, advanced training, and higher wages.
<h4>Increased College Retention and Completion Rates - $62 Billion</h4>
Statistics show that only three out of five students get their college degrees or certificates.
By not completing their higher education, these students lower their chances of improving social mobility and building a solid financial future.

Through a $62 billion investment, the American Families Plan hopes to improve college retention and completion rates by offering:
<ul>
 	<li>Child care</li>
 	<li>Mental health services</li>
 	<li>Mentoring</li>
 	<li>Basic needs grants</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Free Community College - $109 Billion</h4>
Community college can help students get degrees and workers earn credentials to improve their earning power and advance their careers. But enrollment numbers are down due to increased costs, which is why the American Families Plan wants to offer community college for free.

Students who qualify could take up to four years to complete their programs, which is ideal for parents or anyone working a job while studying. If approved, the free community college benefit could help 5.5 million people, including DREAMers.","Are you worried that you lack the necessary funds to invest in you or your child’s education?

President Biden has been busy in his attempt to “build back better.” And one way in which he hopes to achieve that goal is through the passing of his American Families Plan.

What is it? A plan that aims to invest in families and children. Here’s a breakdown of its benefits and how they could make your life easier.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Affordable Health Insurance</h4>
People who buy their own health insurance received two years of lower premiums via the American Rescue Plan. The American Families Plan would make those cheaper premiums permanent. This could save you hundreds of dollars each year on your health insurance premiums.
<h4>Lower Taxes for the Middle Class and Those Hoping to Break Into It</h4>
The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 for kids under six and $3,000 for kids over six. The American Families Plan will extend this credit to 2025. Also, the credit will be fully refundable, giving low-income families the same credit as middle-income ones. This move alone could lift many families out of poverty.

The tax breaks don’t stop there, as the American Families Plan will make the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit increase permanent. The credit returns up to half of a family’s child care expenses for kids under 13. With it, you can receive up to $4,000 for one child or $8,000 for two or more children.

Lastly, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) will be permanently expanded to childless workers. The move would help low-wage workers immensely.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Paid Family and Medical Leave on a National Level</h4>
Workers wouldn’t have to worry about income loss due to childbirth, caring for loved ones, caring for themselves after an illness, dealing with military deployments, and so on. The American Families Plan would create a national paid family and medical leave program for up to twelve weeks and up to $4,000 a month in compensation.
<h4>Expanding Free School Meal Access</h4>
High-poverty schools would have an easier time qualifying for free school meals for all of their students. And the Pandemic Summer-EBT program would be expanded permanently, so parents can buy food for their children when school is not in session.
<h4>Two Years of Free Community College</h4>
All students, including DREAMers, could get their two-year degrees at no cost.
<h4>Improved Pell Grants</h4>
To help cover ever-increasing college costs, Biden wants to boost the max Pell Grant amount by $1,400.
<h4>High-Quality Preschool At No Cost</h4>
Three and four-year-olds could go to preschool for free, saving their parents a ton of money in the process. The average savings is said to be $13,000.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Investments in Teachers</h4>
All employees in preschool programs would get a minimum wage of $15. They would also get benefits and compensation similar to kindergarten teachers with similar qualifications.

Teachers shortages would be addressed, and educators would receive improved training and development.","What’s this “American Families Plan” everyone keeps talking about? And how can it affect you?

3568,"Confused About EBT Cards And SNAP? Read This","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Have you heard of food stamps? You probably have. And while many still use that name, food stamps are now officially referred to as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).

With SNAP, low-income families get help buying nutritious food. In the past, this was achieved through paper vouchers sent in the mail. Now, everything is electronic, which is more convenient, but also more confusing if you’ve never had an EBT card before.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Is EBT?</h4>
EBT stands for Electronic Benefits Transfer. It’s a card that looks and works like an ATM card. You swipe it at the store when checking out, which pays for your items.

What items can you buy with EBT? We’ll discuss that and more so you get a better understanding of how SNAP works.
<h4>How Do You Get an EBT Card?</h4>
Since an EBT card gets loaded with SNAP benefits each month, you’ll first need to apply to the program. The application process includes offering information on your finances and completing an interview to confirm your eligibility. Provided you meet income requirements and other SNAP qualifications, you will be approved and receive your EBT card in the mail.
<h4>How Long Does It Take to Get Approved for SNAP?</h4>
The approval process depends on your location. Some people receive EBT benefits within a week, while others get them within 30 days of applying for SNAP.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Can You Use an EBT Card at Any Store?</h4>
Your EBT card cannot be used at every single store, but you will have plenty of options. Familiar places that accept EBT cards include grocery stores, gas stations, and convenience stores. Some stores like Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, and Target may also accept EBT. And in some cases, you can even buy fresh fruits and veggies from farmers' markets using your EBT card.

If you’re unsure whether a place accepts EBT, check the door for a sign or ask an employee. Even better, you can use the SNAP Retailer Locator to find out beforehand.
<h4>What About Online Purchases? Can You Use Your EBT Card for Those?</h4>
The majority of states now accept EBT online purchases. Check with your SNAP office once you receive your EBT card to see if your state is one of them.
<h4>What Can You Buy With SNAP Benefits?</h4>
You can use your EBT card to buy nutritional necessities like meat, poultry, fish, dairy, bread, rice, cereal, fruits, vegetables, non-alcoholic beverages, snacks, desserts, spices, condiments, etc. Prepared food is usually not allowed. Household supplies, alcohol, tobacco products, health/beauty products, vitamins, supplements, medication, and live animals are not allowed.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Can You Use an EBT Card Out of State?</h4>
Using your EBT card while traveling is usually okay, unless you’re in Puerto Rico. However, if you move to a different state, you will need to reapply for SNAP through that local office.
<h4>How Can You Check Your SNAP Balance?</h4>
On the back of your EBT card, there should be a number to call. Use that to see your SNAP balance. Some states also have apps or portals for viewing balances.","There’s no doubt that getting SNAP benefits on an EBT card can help your family’s nutrition and finances.

Many had no choice but not to pay the rent once the coronavirus appeared, as they simply lacked the funds to give to their landlords. But others have stopped paying the rent by choice, as they feel that an eviction moratorium waives those monthly payments.

Unfortunately, you still have to pay the rent, regardless of COVID-19’s devastating economic impact. The question is, when do you have to pay it? And what does eviction protection really mean? Let’s look at that now.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What the CDC Eviction Moratorium Provides</h4>
“CDC Eviction Moratorium” is fancy wording for this: A stop on evictions. Since an extension just passed, that stop is in place until June 30, 2021. It could be extended once again. But as of now, you have until that date to stay where you are without worrying about eviction for nonpayment of rent. Eviction is still possible for other violations of your lease, but not if you cannot afford the rent at this time.

Now, let’s discuss when that rent is due. Instead of being waived completely, you will have to pay missed rent plus interest and fees once the moratorium is complete. Depending on how many payments you’ve missed, that could be quite a large sum, which is why a payment plan is a must under the moratorium.
<h4>How to Get Eviction Protection From the CDC</h4>
There are two significant steps to getting eviction protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic:
<ul>
 	<li>Apply for the CDC Eviction Moratorium.</li>
 	<li>Work out a payment plan with your landlord.</li>
</ul>
Applying for the moratorium determines your eligibility, as everyone does not qualify. The payment plan gives your landlord assurance that you will pay what’s owed, otherwise, they can legally evict you once the moratorium ends.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How to Apply for the Eviction Moratorium</h4>
You can apply for CDC eviction protection on your own or with the help of a HUD-approved housing counselor. The official form you’ll need to complete is very easy to understand, but a counselor may be of service if you’ve been having issues with your landlord over nonpayment during the pandemic.

Qualifying for the CDC Eviction Moratorium is based on:
<ul>
 	<li>Your income level.</li>
 	<li>The probability of becoming homeless or living in crowded housing if you were evicted.</li>
 	<li>A promise to pay your landlord back rent once the moratorium ends.</li>
</ul>
Income level is most important for determining your eligibility. You can qualify based on income level if just one line in each of these lists applies to you:

List A:
<ul>
 	<li>You receive assistance from the government in the form of food stamps, disability, etc.</li>
 	<li>You received a coronavirus stimulus check.</li>
 	<li>You did not have to report income to the IRS last year.</li>
 	<li>Your individual or joint earnings in 2020 or 2021 were below $99,000 or $198,000, respectively.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

List B:
<ul>
 	<li>You have excessive out-of-pocket medical expenses.</li>
 	<li>You lost your job.</li>
 	<li>You lost hours/wages.</li>
 	<li>You lost income.</li>
</ul>
You can apply for the CDC Eviction Moratorium by <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going here</a>.","News of the CDC’s Eviction Moratorium has many thinking that they no longer have to pay rent.

<h3>How to Lower Your Electricity Bill</h3>
How many times have you received your electric bill in the mail, only to never open it until it's already past due? If it’s happened before, it’s probably because you’re tired of seeing substantial energy costs. Luckily, you can <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/visit-these-money-saving-sites-before-making-your-next-purchase/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">cut those costs</a> without too much work, as we’ll show you now.
<h4>1. Ditch your washer and dryer for more manual methods.</h4>
Your washer and dryer usage can make up a big chunk of your energy and water bills. That’s why you should try to wash your clothes by hand at least a couple of times per month, if not all the time.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

When drying your clothes, use a drying rack. They’re cheap, and as long as you don’t live in an apartment building that doesn’t allow them, these racks can save you a ton of cash since dryers are known to be energy hogs.

If and when you use the washer and dryer, do it when you have a full load. And to speed up drying and make it more efficient, buy some wool dryer balls. They separate clothes, so they dry quicker.
<h4>2. Buy a programmable thermostat.</h4>
It’s the easiest way to control your thermostat when you’re not home.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Charge your gadgets while driving.</h4>
Buy a cheap car charger and take your gadgets on the go to save electricity by not charging them at home. If you do charge them at home, don’t leave them charging all night.
<h4>4. Turn your electronic devices off when they’re not in use.</h4>
With tablets, for example, there’s no need to keep them on when you’re done with them. This will sap their energy and require more frequent charging.
<h4>5. Prevent phantom energy from driving up your bill.</h4>
Leaving devices plugged in uses power, even when they’re technically turned off. This phantom energy can make up a large part of your bill, so buy power strips and switch them off when items are not in use.
<h4>6. Turn your lights off or buy motion sensors.</h4>
A simple rule to follow is to turn off the lights when nobody’s in the room. If this is too difficult to enforce, motion sensors can help.
<h4>7. Limit the use of electronics.</h4>
Instead of having your kids playing video games or watching TV 24/7, try making specific times when they can use those devices. It’s healthier for them, and your electric bill will be better off.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. Use natural light when you need it.</h4>
Open your blinds during the day to avoid using lights. When you leave your house, close the blinds, so that same natural light doesn’t increase your cooling costs.
<h4>9. Switch to LED lights.</h4>
An easy way to cut your lighting costs is to switch to LED lights. Some say this move can reduce your lighting costs by 90 percent, which should make your bill much smaller.","How much are you paying for electricity every month?

3583,"Free Internet FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>Can You Get Free WI-FI From the Government?</h4>
While the government may offer <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/confused-about-ebt-cards-and-snap-read-this/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">free food via SNAP benefits</a>, free medical care through Medicaid, and so on, free Internet isn’t a thing – yet. It could be on the way soon, however.

In February 2021, the FCC announced that it would be launching the Emergency Broadband Benefit. What’s the emergency? The coronavirus pandemic, which caused many to lose their jobs and see significant losses in income. To make things worse, the Internet became necessary for kids taking virtual classes at home and those needing to work remotely. With the Emergency Broadband Benefit, struggling households can get free Internet in most cases to meet those needs.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Qualifying for the Emergency Broadband Benefit could give you as much as $75 monthly towards your Internet bill. Depending on your provider, this could mean free Internet each month. Beyond the monthly benefit, the FCC’s upcoming program could also make owning a computer more affordable with a $100 discount towards purchasing one.

As mentioned, the Emergency Broadband Benefit will be offered to those who need it most. Eligibility will be based on income, qualifying for other forms of public assistance, being eligible for COVID-19 low-cost Internet programs, and so on.

Since the FCC aims to help families gain affordable online access during the pandemic, look for the Emergency Broadband Benefit to offer free Internet very soon.
<h4>Does the government have other Internet assistance programs beyond the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h4>
Yes, the government does have the FCC’s Lifeline program. Unlike the Emergency Broadband Benefit, however, it won’t really give you free Internet.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

While you can get up to $75 per month towards your Internet bill through the Emergency Broadband Benefit, Lifeline will only give you $9.25 per month. Living on federal tribal lands bumps that benefit up to $34.25 per month. You can use that discount to pay less for the Internet or apply it to your cell phone or landline service. Qualifying for Lifeline is based on having a low income or receiving public assistance.
<h4>Can You Get Free Internet if There Are Students in Your Household?</h4>
Many companies stepped up to the plate to make the Internet more affordable in response to the pandemic, especially since students need access to virtual classes. While the Internet service isn’t necessarily free, you can get it at a low cost if you have school-aged children in your home via the Connect2Compete program. Both Mediacom and Cox provide affordable Internet in this area.
<h4>Is There Free Internet Service for Seniors?</h4>
Many seniors are using the Internet nowadays for telehealth appointments, online shopping, and to stay connected with friends and family. Even though seniors may have strayed from Internet usage in the past, that’s no longer the case, making online access a must in many cases.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Until the Emergency Broadband Benefit goes live, seniors may get low-cost Internet through the Lifeline program. They can qualify if they receive veterans' pensions or survivor benefits.","You may have questions about how to get free Internet from the government or if it even exists.

While that can help you feel better, it may not be your best bet anymore. Why? Because drugstores are now opening full-service clinics that provide the same services a doctor’s office can, but at a fraction of the cost.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

This is excellent news if you’re <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/is-telemedicine-your-best-bet-for-staying-healthy/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">tired of paying an arm and a leg every time you have to go to the doctor</a>. According to research, primary care visits have steadily climbed in cost since 2002. To provide an affordable alternative, drugstores like CVS, Walgreens, and even Walmart are opening up low-cost clinics. Here are some of the details:
<ul>
 	<li>CVS – Over 15,000 HealthHUBs expected before 2021 is over.</li>
 	<li>Walgreens – Over 700 Village Medical clinics in the next five years.</li>
 	<li>Walmart – Clinics slated to open in dozens of states before the year ends.</li>
</ul>
What can you expect when you visit one of these clinics? Besides the lower costs, you can look forward to the same type of care you’d get in a doctor’s office. That means you can get treated for an illness, get diagnostic tests, etc.
<h4>Get Your Meds From Amazon</h4>
Imagine saving 80 percent on generic and 40 percent on brand-name prescriptions. If that seems far-fetched, it’s not, as Pharmacy.Amazon.com has launched and is promising such savings.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Amazon Prime members can use the service to find the cheapest meds. Before buying, you can see if you’re better off using insurance or not to get the lowest price. You can also enjoy quick, two-day shipping that’s free, or you can pick up your meds at over 50,000 participating pharmacies.
<h4>Comparison Shop Hospitals</h4>
This year, a new federal rule went live that makes it easy to reduce your healthcare fees. Under the law, hospitals must let the public know costs that they’ve negotiated with insurance companies. Why is this important? Because it allows you comparison shop for the lowest price before visiting a hospital for a test like an MRI or surgery.

If you’re wondering when this would come into play, think about your health insurance deductible. If it’s high, you’ll have to pay a pretty penny out of pocket until your insurance coverage kicks in. As such, you’ll want to get that test or surgery at the hospital offering the most affordable rate.

To find out what a hospital is charging, go to their website or contact their billing department. By law, they’ll have to disclose that info that you can use to make your decision.

<h4>Cut Your Medicare Costs</h4>
Do you have a Medicare Advantage plan? If you do, and it covers dental, vision, and hearing, you may want to get it at a lower cost. You can do this by changing your Advantage plan between the annual period of January 1 and March 31.

To get the lowest cost, you may want to give Walmart a look. They recently teamed up with various Medicare Advantage providers to offer very affordable plans, which you can find at WalmartInsurance.com.","You could be overpaying for healthcare if you don’t follow these simple tips that can lead to significant savings on prescriptions, doctor visits, and more.","2021-05-20 14:10:19",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/4-ways-to-save-1000s-on-healthcare/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_400709974.jpg,shutterstock_400709974.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_400709974.jpg,3587,"Stethoscope,And,Calculator,Symbol,For,Health,Care,Costs,Or,Medical",,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_400709974.jpg,Resources,"Debt Help",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,4-ways-to-save-1000s-on-healthcare,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-26 14:38:40"

How often do you use your phone or Internet? The answer is probably every day, and it may even be every minute when you take your other family members into account.

Since we use the phone and Internet so much, especially nowadays, they’re costs that cannot be eliminated from our budgets. No longer are they luxuries, but necessities, which means that <a href=""https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/free-internet-faq/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">paying the least amount for these services</a> is a goal many of us would like to achieve.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

How can you pay less for phone and Internet? You could shop around, get the cheapest, plan, and so on. Or you could apply for the FCC’s Lifeline program and use it to get discounted service. Here are some frequently asked questions about the program:
<h4>How Much Is the Lifeline Discount?</h4>
You can get up to a $9.25 monthly discount on your phone (landline or cell) or Internet service through Lifeline. It’s not a huge discount, but in this current financial climate, every dollar counts.

If you live on federal tribal lands, you can get an additional $25 discount, which would reduce your phone or Internet bill by a total of $34.25.
<h4>Does Lifeline Offer Free Cell Phones?</h4>
In some cases, yes, you can get a free cell phone as a Lifeline recipient. This depends on the participating company you choose.

For example, Assurance Wireless offered Lifeline customers a free Android phone, plus free unlimited texts, voice minutes, call waiting, caller ID, voicemail, and multiple GB of free data.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>How Can You Find a Local Company That Participates in Lifeline?</h4>
<a href=""https://data.usac.org/publicreports/CompaniesNearMe/Download/Report"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Click here</a> to find your nearest participating provider by entering your city and state or zip code into the corresponding fields.

Can you use Lifeline to get discounts on your cell, landline, and Internet service simultaneously?

Unfortunately, the answer to this question is no. There’s a limit of one discount per household, so you can get just one of those services at a lower cost through the program.
<h4>Is Everyone Eligible for Lifeline?</h4>
No. You’ll need to make less than 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, or you’ll need to receive benefits from government programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Section 8, SSI, etc., to qualify.

To show that you qualify, you will need to provide proof in the form of three consecutive pay stubs, a tax return, or an official card or letter that corresponds to your government program.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How Do You Apply for Lifeline?</h4>
Find a participating company using the link listed above. Once you have their contact information, give them a call and say that you’d like to <a href=""https://www.lifelinesupport.org/how-to-get-lifeline/"">apply for Lifeline</a>. They’ll give you an application to fill out. You will need to provide documentation to prove income or participation in a government program, along with some form of valid ID to complete your application.

While you can apply for Lifeline by mail, choose the online method instead. It’s a lot faster and can offer immediate approval so you can see those saving sooner.","Are you looking to reduce the cost of your phone or Internet bill?

There are resources that provide those computers for free. We’ll show you where to look so you can snag yours soon.

Have you gone laptop shopping recently, only to stop looking completely? If so, you may have been put off by the price, as even a low-end laptop can set you back a few hundred bucks. Combine that cost with a low income, and it’s no wonder why so many households lack the technology they need to advance their college education or help their kids learn.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Are there ways to get a laptop on the cheap? Sure. But for this article, we’ll show you how to go even lower in price, as these resources offer laptops for free.
<h3>Where to Get Free Laptops</h3>
<h4>Alliance for Technology Refurbishing &amp; Reuse</h4>
The AFTRR lists this as their vision: “Digital equity for all.” How do they achieve it? By working with local organizations to ensure those in need get access to free computers.

Depending on where you’re located, AFTRR may be able to give you a free laptop. This all hinges on the organizations near you, which you can find by hitting the link above and using the locator map. It will show you local organizations that work with AFTRR so you can contact them and see if you qualify for a free laptop.
<h4>The On It Foundation</h4>
Do you have a child in your household who is in grades K-12? If so, the On It Foundation can give you a free laptop if that child attends public school and also qualifies for the free or reduced school lunch program.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Computers With Causes</h4>
Here’s an organization that offers free laptops not only to underprivileged kids so they can study, but also to returning military members and low-income households.

To get a free laptop from Computers With Causes, you will need to apply and show that you have financial need. If eligible, you will have to take one more step to ensure your finances aren’t negatively impacted, and that’s contacting any government assistance program you’re on.
Why? Because some programs will end benefits if you receive compensation, such as a free laptop. In other words, you don’t want to receive one free reward if you’re going to lose another.
<h4>With Causes</h4>
While it may have a similar name, With Causes is not the same as Computers With Causes. To qualify here, you will have to show that you’re a veteran or current military member, come from a low-income household, or live in a shelter for battered women.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Online Schools</h4>
You can get a free laptop for your child or your college studies by attending an online school.
Some children can study at home, and certain schools will offer free laptops to do so. Meanwhile, some online colleges offer free laptops with enrollment, such as the ones in this database.
<h4>The Local Library</h4>
This option won’t give you a free laptop to take home. But if you need a computer to use at no cost and want free Internet access, the library is tough to beat.","There’s no need to let the cost of a laptop keep you from owning one.

3625,"Where To Find Cheap Flights","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

After so many months of being stuck inside, people are going all out with travel. And while it’s become cheaper to fly, you can cut those flight costs even more by using the following resources.
<h4>Google Flights</h4>
Have you ever sat on the couch and had the urge just to fly somewhere? If so, that urge may have disappeared by thinking that flight was out of your budget and not knowing what it really costs. With Google Flights, though, you can quickly get an idea of the costs you’ll be looking at so you can begin turning your trip fantasy into a reality.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While you can’t book an actual flight on Google Flights, here are several reasons to use it:
<ul>
 	<li>You can view a calendar to see when flights are the cheapest, which makes trip planning a lot easier.</li>
 	<li>You can pick a country to see how airfares differ among airports in various cities.</li>
 	<li>You can see how prices have changed over time with a price graph, which helps with trip planning too.</li>
 	<li>You can see which airline has the cheapest flights.</li>
</ul>
Add in a price tracker, and it’s easy to see why Google Flights can be your best friend when looking to book a flight in the future.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Hopper</h4>
When it comes to finding the lowest flight prices, timing is everything. Some say you should book on certain days, at specific times, weeks ahead, etc., all of which can be confusing. Instead of figuring this out manually, you can use Hopper to predict when prices will be at their lowest point.

How accurate is Hopper? It claims to have 95 percent accuracy, which should give you some peace of mind when you look to book. And if you set up price alerts on Hopper, you won’t have to manually check flights, as it will tell you when it’s time to buy.

Use Hopper to find flights, and it’s estimated you could save as much as $120 on international airfare and $50 on domestic.
<h4>Skyscanner</h4>
You may want to plan a trip on specific dates. But since flight prices can fluctuate so much, you want to book at the right time. With Skyscanner, you can do this with ease via pricing alerts for specific dates and routes. As a bonus, Skyscanner can help you pick a nearby airport that may cost less than your original destination. Without this feature, those are savings you may have never known existed.

<h4>Scott’s Cheap Flights</h4>
Want to save up to 90 percent on flights? Then use Scott’s Cheap Flights, as that’s what the site claims it can do. Use it to get free flight alerts so you can pinpoint the best time to buy and travel. And if you travel a ton, you can sign up for its premium service that offers more bells and whistles like “mistake fares,” where prices drop, but tickets must be claimed quickly.","Are you looking to explore a bit?

3629,"Everything You Need To Know About Pell Grants","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Student loans and scholarships tend to steal the spotlight when it comes to paying for college. What’s often overlooked or even forgotten? Grants, which may be the best of the bunch.

What makes a college grant so great? The fact that it doesn’t need to be paid back, which makes it a lot better than a student loan. Plus, many grants are based on financial need instead of merit, making them better than scholarships.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

When you start looking for grants, you may see the name “Pell Grant” pop up. It’s one of the most popular grants out there, and it serves as a helping hand from the federal government to make your college costs much more manageable.
<h4>Pell Grant Eligibility</h4>
Qualifying for a Pell Grant is pretty straightforward. The main requirement is that you can show that you have a financial need.

Beyond that main requirement, you usually have to be an undergraduate student to qualify for a federal Pell Grant. This means that you cannot have a degree and hope to get financial help from the program. There is one exception to this rule, and that’s if you are participating in a postbaccalaureate teacher certification program. If that’s the case, then a Pell Grant may be in play.

Incarceration, either in a federal or state institution, can also prevent you from receiving a Pell Grant. Even once you get out, you may still be ineligible if you have to perform a civil commitment for a sexual offense.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Pell Grant Amounts</h4>
Should you qualify for the maximum Pell Grant in the 2020-2021 school year, you can receive $6,345. That’s a nice sum to be had for simply filling out an application, but the final amount can depend on various factors.

How much you receive will depend on your full or part-time status, school attendance costs, Expected Family Contribution, etc.

While some forms of financial aid consider all of the awards you receive, the Pell Grant does not. In other words, if you have other grants and scholarships, they will not negatively impact your Pell Grant award.

Once your Pell Grant is approved, you can choose how you want to receive it. Some students prefer to have the funds sent straight to their university. Others like to receive the money personally. A combination of both methods is an option as well.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Applying for a Pell Grant</h4>
You can kickstart the Pell Grant application process by completing your FAFSA form. It will also help you apply for other federal grants, which is why you should complete the form as soon as possible.
<h4>Pell Grant Duration</h4>
A Pell Grant can last up to 12 terms, or six years of college. If you get a degree, your Pell Grant eligibility will end at that point if it comes before the 12-term limit.
<h4>Maintaining a Pell Grant</h4>
Keeping your Pell Grant is relatively simple. You’ll have to maintain your student status and fill out a FAFSA form annually to keep receiving those funds.","We’ll answer all of your questions in this quick guide to help you fund your college education for free.","2021-08-01 00:45:02",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pell-grants/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_155347391.png,shutterstock_155347391.png,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_155347391.png,3630,shutterstock_155347391,,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_155347391.png,Resources,Education,publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,everything-you-need-to-know-about-pell-grants,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-12 14:05:20"

If you answered yes to any of those questions, you could probably use some extra cash to keep you afloat. And while you could take the old-fashioned route of finding another job to get that cash, this might be an easier and even better option: Selling your used stuff on the Internet.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Even if you’ve never done it before, you can start selling your things online with ease. You can even start today if you need cash in a pinch, and these tips should help you see success.
<h4>Visit These Online Marketplaces</h4>
Before you try selling anything online, take a closer look at the various online marketplaces to get a feel for what’s out there. Doing so will help you see how easy it is to start making your own sales. It will also help you know what people are selling, so you don’t limit yourself to what you put up for sale.

No matter how obscure the item may be, there’s probably a market for it. In short, if you have it and want to get rid of it, put the thing online to see if you can get any buyers. You’d be surprised at what can sell quickly.

With that out of the way, here are some of the most popular online marketplaces that can help you unload your stuff for extra income:
<ul>
 	<li>eBay</li>
 	<li>Facebook Marketplace</li>
 	<li>Craigslist</li>
 	<li>Decluttr</li>
 	<li>OfferUp</li>
 	<li>Letgo</li>
 	<li>Poshmark</li>
 	<li>ThredUP</li>
 	<li>Etsy</li>
 	<li>Nextdoor</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

With some of those sites, you may have local sales where you meet up with the buyer. To play it safe, make sure you meet in a public place where other people are around.
<h4>Make a Winning Ad</h4>
You don’t need to have a marketing degree to make convincing ads. And you don’t have to be creative either.

To make a quick ad that’s bound to sell, look at your competitors. See how they’re selling things. Do they have a lot of pictures? Are their headlines catchy? Do they provide a lot of details on the product? Whatever elements they use, be sure to include them in your ads. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel here, as the goal is to post your item quickly to get cash soon.

As for what makes a winning ad, it all starts with great pictures. Whatever the site’s limit is for images per ad, make sure you reach it, so buyers get to see the item’s condition. Besides offering numerous pictures, make sure that they’re taken in good lighting and are not blurry.

Your product description is essential as well. It should include several keywords to make the ad easy to find through a search. The ad should also include any details that could entice the buyer to purchase your item, including any wear and tear.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

Be truthful and thorough in your ads, and you should start making sales soon. And if you get good enough at this, you could turn it into a business. How? By collecting free stuff online through sites like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace that other people give away.

A garage sale is a great way to kill two birds with one stone, as you can clear out clutter and make some quick cash.
<h4>Give People Time to Plan for Your Sale</h4>
Can you attract yard sale customers at the last minute if they pass by your sign or house? Sure, but you can get even more customers by posting an ad, either online or in the paper, ahead of time.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If your sale is happening on the weekend, post your ad on the Monday or Tuesday before. People who see the ad can include your garage sale in their plans. If you post the ad the day before, people might have plans already, which will keep them from coming.

To increase your exposure, post your ad more than once. Do it on the Monday before, then again on the day before as a reminder.
<h4>Gather Some Freebies</h4>
You can give people an incentive to stop by and have a look around by offering a freebie. Pick out some of the lowest-value items you have, such as small trinkets or toys, and put them in a giveaway box. Since people love free stuff, they’ll stop in for the freebie and then look at what else you have.
<h4>Do Your Research</h4>
Prepping ahead of time can help you get top dollar for your items. First, think of any items you have that have an interesting history. Perhaps they are linked to someone famous or have been passed down through your family. Whatever the angle, be sure to include it on a note next to the item so your visitors have a background on what they may buy. In doing so, you will add to the item’s value and make it a more attractive purchase.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Beyond interesting histories, also research the retail prices of your more expensive items, such as designer clothes or electronics. Post the retail prices next to the sale prices to show visitors how much of a deal they’re getting. By seeing the contrast in prices, you can generate a fear of missing out, which should lead to a sale.
<h4>Use Plenty of Red</h4>
Red balloons. Red signs. Red tablecloths. Why red? Because studies show it makes people stop, just like a Stop sign.

Some say simply using red at your yard sale can help you sell items for 10 percent more. Not only does the color attract outsiders, but it also generates a higher-end feeling that allows you to charge more.
<h4>Pick Your Keywords Properly</h4>
Whether it’s in an online ad or a sign in your yard, picking the right keywords can make a massive difference in your garage sale’s success.

If you have many expensive items for sale, say that you’re holding a “moving” or “estate” sale. Similarly, brand-name clothes and electronics give you the right to say you’re selling “designer” or “luxury” items.

Do you have a ton of old movies, books, and records for sale? List them as “rare collectibles.” And if you have some things that have wear and tear, you can hide that by saying they’re “antique” or “vintage.”","To ensure your garage sale is a money-making hit, follow these “insider” secrets.","2021-10-01 00:03:14",post,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/insider-secrets-for-selling-your-stuff-at-a-garage-sale/,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1787043014.jpg,shutterstock_1787043014.jpg,/chroot/home/afd92776/unitedfamilynetwork.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1787043014.jpg,3638,"Various,Things,Placed,On,Table,And,Chairs,In,Backyard,,Garage",,,,https://unitedfamilynetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1787043014.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,1,ufn_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,insider-secrets-for-selling-your-stuff-at-a-garage-sale,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:25:01"

3643,"5 Reasons To Apply For A $500 Installment Loan","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here’s a common problem that many people face. In fact, according to statistics, over 12 million people have faced it in the past: You have bad credit, and you need a loan to help pay for an emergency.

Since family and friends can’t help, you turn to other avenues. But since you have that bad credit, most lenders aren’t willing to work with you. Where do you end up? Applying for a payday loan. And even though it gets you that cash you need, it comes with issues that can do more harm than good.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

We’ll discuss why a traditional payday loan isn’t your best bet if you need up to $500. And we’ll reveal the better alternative that offers more benefits than just fast funding.
<h3>Why You Should Apply For an Installment Loan</h3>
<h4>1. You have bad credit.</h4>
Why do lenders check credit before handing over cash? Because they want to ensure that you’ll pay them back. Unfortunately, bad credit can be a sign to a creditor that they may have issues collecting, which is why you may have trouble getting a loan with a low credit score.

An installment loan from a company like Possible Finance can approve you for up to $500 even if you have bad credit. How? Because they do not check your credit in the first place.
<h4>2. You need cash fast.</h4>
If your rent is due or your utility company is about to shut your lights off, you don’t have the luxury of waiting until your next paycheck. You need quick cash to cover your emergency, which is what an installment loan can give you.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

Apply with possible finance for an installment loan, and you could get up to $500 in a matter of minutes.
<h4>3. You don’t want to go deeper into debt.</h4>
Getting a payday loan can be a lot more trouble than it’s worth. With interest rates up to 400 percent, you may regret getting that loan later on when you find yourself in a deep financial hole trying to pay it back.

Do installment loans charge interest? Of course, they do, as they are loans. But the interest rates are lower than those of payday loans, which makes them less of a risk.
<h4>4. You need more time to pay.</h4>
A payday loan isn’t just expensive. It also requires faster repayment, so you may have to pay yours back as soon as you get your next paycheck. You can avoid this stress by applying for an installment loan that can be paid back in two months.
<h4>5. You want to build your credit.</h4>
Your credit won’t fix itself, as you’ll need to make moves to increase your score. Since installment loans are paid over two months, and they’re reported to the three credit bureaus, you can use them to build your credit as well.

3646,"3 Payment “Hacks” That Make It Easy to Save Money","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you aren’t implementing these three hacks, the answer is yes.

Let’s face it: Trying to find room in your budget is no fun. Most of the time, it involves cutting entertainment expenses such as dining out or a Netflix subscription. Or it involves sacrificing your comfort by making moves like turning your thermostat up or using less water for bathing.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While those moves can save you money, we’ll discuss some much simpler ones that can keep more cash in your pocket without having to sacrifice a thing. By simply being a bit wiser with the way you pay for things, you can save every single month while still maintaining your comfortable lifestyle.

<h4>1. Never pay a person over the phone.</h4>
Paying over the phone is more convenient than doing so in person. It can also be a lot more expensive, though, which is why we recommended using the following options to make bill payments:
<ul>
 	<li>Through the company’s app.</li>
 	<li>Online.</li>
 	<li>Via automated phone service.</li>
 	<li>By sending in a check.</li>
</ul>
What’s the problem with paying a live person over the phone? Some companies charge you for doing so, and those fees can add up.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources -->

For instance, let’s say you use Spectrum Cable for your TV services and Verizon Wireless for your cell phone. Spectrum charges $5 to make a payment over the phone using one of their representatives, while Verizon charges $7.

Now, imagine you pay that way each month because you didn’t know any better. That adds up to $144 per year!

When is the only time when you should pay a live rep via phone? If it’s your only option because the bill is about to be past due. Or, you can do so if the company does not charge for such a service.
<h4>2. Never use apps or the Internet to place food orders.</h4>
This tip may seem counterproductive, as you can find great food deals on restaurant apps and websites. However, studies show that you can spend up to $10 more by simply using an app or the Internet to place your food order. Why? Blame it on the upsells and how easy it is to add items to your order.

Now, compare that to how it is when you order food over the phone. If you call up your favorite pizza place, you probably know what you want. And if the person taking your order is busy and slammed with phone calls from other customers, they probably can’t waste a ton of time taking your order. Due to these reasons, phone orders tend to cost less, which can lower your food costs. As a bonus, ordering less food can help you from packing on the pounds, which can lead to lower health care costs in the future.

[the_ad id=""2906""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. Never use autopay.</h4>
Can autopay come in handy if you’re forgetful about paying your bills on time? Sure, but it can also lead to higher bills if you don’t check them each month.

Studies show that using autopay can lead to overpaying six percent on your bills. So, if you have a utility bill that’s $100 per month, that extra six percent can cost you $72 per year.

What’s so bad about autopay? It can keep you from analyzing your bills, which can prevent you from spotting excessive usage or clerical errors that can keep your expenses high.","Are you wasting money with the way you pay bills or place orders?
