3183,"Boost Your Holiday Budget While Working These Seasonal Side Jobs","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The holidays are coming, and with that, comes two things: Your need for cash and the need for part-time workers by big box retailers looking to meet the holiday rush.

What’s the benefit of working a side job during the holidays? Besides the additional income you can use for spending, it’s competition.

As more workers are needed, retailers compete to recruit that much-needed help. In the process, you can find better wages and benefits than you’d usually see during other less busy parts of the year.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Who’s looking to hire? Here’s a tiny sample of that list:
<h3>1. Amazon</h3>
While online giant Amazon seems to stay busy throughout the year, they’re looking for help for the holidays.

You can find opportunities via Amazon’s jobs portal. Although they may not hire as many seasonal workers as in the past, they do need to staff their operations network super-soon with tens of thousands of people.

With wages hovering around $15 to start, you can earn decent money for your gift-buying needs. You may even be able to leverage the seasonal work into a full-time position with the company.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>2. UPS</h3>
As temperatures cool down, you may start seeing more UPS trucks on the road. UPS says they make 40 million deliveries during the holidays per day, which increases their need for drivers and related positions.

If you’re looking for full-time work, now’s the time to apply with UPS. Over one-third of their seasonal package handlers get full-time positions, so you could kill two birds with one stone.

As an added perk for college students, UPS offers tuition assistance for seasonal workers. Depending on your location, you could receive up to $1,300 towards your college tuition over three months.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>3. Target</h3>
Target is looking to hire over 130,000 workers during the holidays at their retail locations and distribution centers. Look for openings on their seasonal jobs site, and you’re likely to find one near you.

At $13 per hour to start, Target offers competitive wages. Once hired, you also become eligible for a 20 percent discount on fruits and vegetables and 10 percent off items storewide. If you work on Thanksgiving or Christmas, you’ll get bonus pay too.
<h3>4. Gap Inc.</h3>
Want a seasonal job with the potential for career advancement? If so, look no further than Gap Inc. and its bevy of brand stores like Banana Republic, Gap, Athleta, and more.

Gap Inc. needs workers to fill seasonal positions at its retail stores, distribution centers, and call centers. Beyond competitive wages, seasonal workers can enjoy such perks as 30 percent discounts at outlet stores and a whopping 50 percent off at Banana Republic, Gap, and Old Navy.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h3>5. Kohl’s</h3>
One of the largest department store chains in the U.S. is in the market for nearly 100,000 seasonal workers.

Work for Kohl’s at one of their retail stores or distribution centers, and you can enjoy weekly pay and a 15 percent employee discount. Bump up your hours to more than 30 per week, and you’ll become eligible for 401(k) and health benefits.","Need extra cash for those upcoming holiday expenses?

3185,"4 Better Times To Buy Than Cyber Monday","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Some people miss Black Friday because they’re still too full from Thanksgiving to even ponder purchasing anything in person. Others miss it on purpose because they hear Cyber Monday is better.

While Cyber Monday certainly has its share of decent online deals, it's important not to get caught up in the hype of this shopping holiday.

Since it comes just a few days after Black Friday, some patient purchasers tend to go overboard. They feel that they have to “make up for lost time” since they spent nothing on Black Friday, so they go all out once Monday rolls around.

Others go crazy on Cyber Monday only due to its reputation. Although Black Friday may be more widely known, Cyber Monday seems like the “smart” day to cash in on deals. And some will buy things they don’t need just because it looks like the cool thing to do.

Whether it's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon’s Prime Day, or some other over-marketed sales holiday, know this: There are plenty of under-the-radar days to find deals too, so don’t believe the hype.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Some products are strategically priced at their lowest during certain times of the year. Many of them are popular Cyber Monday items, which is why this article is meant to open your eyes.

To what? To the fact that some deals are worth waiting for, and since you’re about to see when they’ll appear, you can skip Cyber Monday without losing any sleep.
<h3>Post-December for Holiday Decorations</h3>
It can be tempting to load up on holiday decorations when the season hits and they surround you everywhere you go. Unfortunately, retailers know this and use it to their advantage.

Decorations are in high demand during the holidays, so retailers can keep charging a premium without worrying about losing sales. In other words, be happy with the decorations you already have if you want to maximize your savings.

Once the holidays are over, you’ll find better deals on decorations than even Cyber Monday could offer. Stores will need to move their stock, and since people won’t be decorating anymore, you can snag some good finds at affordable prices.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>January and February for Bedding and Mattresses</h3>
Everyone needs a good night’s sleep, and even though beds are a necessity, retailers still discount them.

Is Cyber Monday your best bet for deals on bedding and mattresses? No, so if you were looking for a more comfy comforter or a better bed, wait just a little bit longer.

As far as bedding is concerned, you’ll find the cheapest sheets and the like during January’s white sales. And to get the mattress that goes under them, wait until February.
<h3>January for Exercise Equipment</h3>
What often comes with the new year? Resolutions, many of which are centered on fitness.

You may want to ring in the new year with some fabulous fitness equipment to help you meet your lofty goals. Cyber Monday may seem like the perfect day to find some, but wait until January instead.

You should find plenty of exercise equipment on sale during that first month of the year, so there’s no need to hurry now. Besides, you probably wouldn’t want to exercise during the holidays anyway with all the get-togethers and great food clogging up your calendar.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>January for Jewelry</h3>
If it sparkles, wait until after the new year to buy it. That’s a solid rule to follow when it comes to jewelry since it often drops in price in January.

What’s the connection between jewelry and January? It’s right before Valentine’s Day, which is when tons of jewelry is gifted. Retailers know this and use January to entice buyers via deeper discounts.

With the holiday shopping season upon us, you want to save as much money as possible so you can get the gifts you need. Every cent you can save counts, and one of the best ways to score substantial savings is via free Thanksgiving turkey.

Several stores give out free or highly-discounted turkeys around Thanksgiving. While this may not seem like a smart financial move, they do it for marketing. And they do it to entice you to spend on other items in their store.

The following list showcases ways in which you can get that complimentary turkey. If you do have success, remember that just one turkey may not be enough to feed all your guests.

A pro tip is to have one pound of turkey per guest. This will ensure everyone gets fed. To have some leftovers for sandwiches and the like, aim for 1.5 pounds per guest.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

With that out of the way, here’s your free turkey list. Hopefully, some of these options are in your area:
<h4>ACME Markets</h4>
You could snag a free turkey big enough to feed 10 to 14 guests in the past from ACME. All you had to do was present the coupon and spend $100 on a transaction.

Check with your local ACME to ensure this promotion is still running.
<h4>Fareway Meat &amp; Grocery</h4>
Spend $50 or more at Fareway’s Famous Fresh Meat Counter, and you can get a free 14-pound basted young turkey.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Giant Food Stores</h4>
If you shop a lot at Giant, you could use reward points from your Bonus Card to get a free turkey. While this was last year’s promotion, pick up a weekly circular to see if they’re doing it again.
<h4>Hy-Vee</h4>
If you purchase a Hormel Cure 81 ham, you could get a free Honeysuckle turkey to give you two protein options on your table.
<h4>Safeway</h4>
Are you a Safeway Club Card member? If you make a $150 purchase, you could get a free turkey.
<h4>ShopRite</h4>
Have you been racking up points on your Price Plus club card at ShopRite? Depending on how many points you have, you could convert them into a free turkey or ham.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Weis</h4>
Shopping at Weis can pay off if you collect enough points. 400 points are usually enough to get a free turkey from this chain of grocery stores.
<h4>WinCo</h4>
If there’s a WinCo near you, check to see if they’re still giving out free turkeys. Last year they did it if you spent $100.

Do you not see any local stores on this list? Contact your grocer to see what types of turkey deals they have going on. At the very least, you should find some discounts by asking around.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

As you can see, stores get creative this time of year when it comes to holiday food promotions, and these examples show you the various ways people get turkeys without having to pay for them directly.

In short, don’t fret if your favorite store isn’t listed.

3192,"What’s Happening With Student Loans In Response To COVID-19?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Millions were left out of work and saw their finances shattered as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. This has caused concern among many who are saddled with student loan debt. If you are one of them, you’ll be glad to know that the government has made moves to give people with federal student loans a break.
<h4>How the CARES Act Deals With Student Loans</h4>
On March 27 of this year, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) became official. Its overall goal was to give people relief in response to the pandemic, and one area where it aimed to do so was with student loans.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Unfortunately, the CARES Act does not provide relief for all student loans. The government must hold the loan. Specifically, it must be guaranteed or provided through the U.S. Department of Education to be eligible for relief.

If your loan qualifies, you won’t have to make a payment until September 30, 2020. This deferral began on March 13, and during it, there will be zero interest as well.

Loans that qualify for zero-interest loan deferral until September 30 include the following from the Department of Education:
<ul>
 	<li>Direct loans</li>
 	<li>Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)</li>
 	<li>Perkins loans</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

If you are unsure whether or not your loan qualifies for zero-interest deferral, contact your provider. It’s better to gain clarity via direct communication than to assume it qualifies and get hit with penalties later for non-payment.

If you do have a federally-funded loan (and you double-checked to make sure), you will not have to take any action to enjoy the suspended payments. Your federal loan provider will automatically suspend payments until September.
<h4>What to Do If the CARES Act Doesn't Cover Your Student Loans</h4>
FFEL or Perkins loans that are commercially held will not enjoy the same relief benefits as federally-funded loans.

In the case of FFEL, three months of disaster forbearance is an option that could help. For those three months, your payments will be suspended. Your loans won’t affect your credit, either, as they’ll be in good standing. Interest will accrue during the three forbearance months, however.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

If you find that your loans are not covered in any way by the CARES Act, get on the phone with your provider to see what your options are. It’s no secret that the coronavirus has created job and income loss, and student loan providers know this.

Although the relief available may not be as good as zero-interest deferral until September, you may be able to come up with an agreement with your provider. At the very least, it can provide some breathing room as you look for ways to pay your other, more urgent bills like rent and utilities.
<h4>How Your Employer Could Help</h4>
While the CARES Act won’t provide direct relief for student loans that are privately funded, it does make a push towards incentivizing companies to pay off the student debt of their employees.

In 2020, companies can make tax-free payments toward employee student loans for as much as $5,250. To see if you’re eligible for this repayment assistance, talk to your employer.","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered some changes when it comes to student loans.

It can be tough to look for silver linings when your rent is due and you don’t have the cash to pay it. Here’s one to keep in the back of your head should this problem arise, though: You’re certainly not alone.

It seems like everyone has problems paying the rent at one time or another. It’s how you handle that problem that determines if you end up on the street or you get to continue living in your home.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the best tool to use when you can’t pay the rent in full or even at all? A late rent hardship letter, and here are the steps to take before crafting one to your landlord.
<h4>1. Address the problem and accept that it exists.</h4>
Whether it’s due to mismanaging your money, having to dip into your emergency fund, or losing your job, you’ll have to acknowledge that you can’t pay the rent before you can proceed. If you’re in denial about the issue or keep putting it off, you’ll only make things worse.

Once you see that you won’t be able to make a timely payment in full, it’s time to access that backup plan, which is your hardship letter.
<h4>2. Come up with details as to why you can’t pay the rent.</h4>
Build your argument before writing your rent hardship letter. Take notes on what was different this month.

If you can, include dates when you lost your job or had an emergency that cut into your funds. The more details you can provide, the better.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Think of how you’re working to fix the situation.</h4>
Hopefully, you took action once you realized you were short on funds. Did you start looking for jobs? Have you applied for loans or credit cards to fill in any financial gaps? Did you start selling personal items you no longer need for quick cash?

Whatever moves you made to try to come up with your rent payment, write them down, as you’ll want to include all of them in your letter.
<h4>4. Pick a date for when you’ll be ready.</h4>
You don’t want to give an unrealistic estimate, but it’s important to tell your landlord when you plan on having their payment.

Pick an exact date and stick to it. This will give your landlord some peace of mind while you fix your finances.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>5. Scrounge up whatever you can.</h4>
Even a partial rent payment can put your landlord at ease until you have the full amount. Do your best to put together some money that you can give them right now.
<h4>6. Know of any penalties.</h4>
Your lease should list what can happen if you’re late paying rent. This includes any penalties or late fees.

Since money is tight, you’ll want to include a section in your hardship letter where you state that this is (hopefully) your first time being late, and it’s not a repeat issue. Ask that any late fees be waived.
<h4>7. Put it all together.</h4>
Now that you’re prepared with your argument and any details to support it, write your late rent hardship letter.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

As hard as it sounds, you can quickly find a template online to fill in with your personal information and details. Be sure to include everything in your letter, including a promise that you won’t be late on the rent again.

Give the letter to your landlord as soon as possible. By giving them a professional explanation of your situation, they should be willing to work with you to get your rent paid and keep that roof over your head.","Being late on your rent can definitely put you in a bind.

We’ll show you where to find it and how to use it so you can get started today. Regardless of how hard COVID-19’s economic impact has hit you, this much is true: You can’t stop eating.

Food is a necessity for everyone, but it becomes especially essential when very young children are in the picture, and their nutrition is at stake.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Through the WIC program, you can ensure your children get some of the nutrition they need. And to see if you qualify, there’s a WIC Prescreening Tool online that makes the process quite quick and pain-free. Let’s look at how it works.
<h4>Using the WIC Prescreening Tool</h4>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service set up the WIC Prescreening Tool to give people a glimpse into the program’s application process. While handy, this tool is not a replacement for an appointment with your local WIC agency. As its name suggests, it’s just a prescreening tool to give you an idea where you stand.

Here are the steps to take so you can get started in applying for WIC:

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->
<ol>
 	<li>Access the WIC Prescreening Tool online by going here. As you’ll see on the front page, the tool takes approximately 15 minutes to complete, but it could take a lot less time, depending on your answers.</li>
 	<li>Click on “Get started” to begin answering questions about your eligibility.</li>
 	<li>You will see a common theme with many of the eligibility questions. They will ask if certain conditions apply to you or anyone in your household. Keep this in mind when answering, as it will affect your eligibility.</li>
 	<li>Continue to answer questions until it is no longer necessary. Once you see a message that says, “Based on your responses, you may be eligible for WIC benefits!” you will be asked to contact your local agency. This is to set up an appointment to truly determine if you qualify for WIC.</li>
 	<li>You can print a summary of your prescreening to bring to your appointment. It may help accelerate the process by providing your agent with answers to questions they may need to ask.</li>
 	<li>Below the “Print Summary” link, you should see an area with a documentation list. This details the different types of documents you’ll need to have to determine eligibility.</li>
</ol>
For instance, as proof of income, you’ll need to bring things like your most recent pay stubs or tax return. If you’re currently enrolled in any benefits programs that satisfy the automatic income requirement, you’ll need to bring those ID cards or notices of eligibility.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

For residency, documents like current utility bills or a lease agreement may suffice. You will also need proof of ID, and may need proof of pregnancy, depending on where you live.

Where can you find these scholarships? We’ll list some here. But you can also find them by searching online, looking through scholarship book directories, or talking to friends, family, and counselors who can point you in the right direction.

See how one website can help prevent that from happening during these tough times caused by the coronavirus.

Think of the essential you genuinely need to survive. Then think of how they’ve been impacted since COVID-19 came onto the scene.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Your shelter was probably affected due to losing your job, being furloughed, or seeing a drop in your income. With such happenings, how can you be expected to pay your rent or mortgage? Luckily, some eviction halts were put into place to keep you in your home.

What comes next? Food, although you could argue it’s even more important than shelter. You can only survive a certain number of days without food, making it an absolute must. But again, how can you pay for something when you’re almost out of money? In this case, the answer is to get help from the government and one of its food assistance programs.

You could start searching for such programs one by one. Or you could go to the USA.gov food assistance page to see them all in a single spot.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Finding Food Assistance Through USA.gov</h4>
There are two main reasons to use this site for your coronavirus food assistance needs. First, it’s an official site of the U.S. government, meaning you can trust it without worrying about misinformation or being scammed. Second, it showcases various ways to get help with food in one place.

If you need food so severely that hunger has already struck, your best bet is to get immediate aid via the National Hunger Hotline. This phone line comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and it’s intended to offer emergency food assistance.

You can get advice in English or Spanish by calling 1-866-3-HUNGRY. Just make sure you call during the line’s office hours, which are 7 am to 10 pm Monday through Friday.

The National Hunger Hotline isn’t the only number to call if you need immediate food aid, as 211 is another. Dialing those three digits on your phone can point you in the right direction of any local emergency food assistance from churches and other religious organizations or community groups.

Do you have any children who attend school? Check out the section on the USA.gov food assistance page regarding free food programs for school-age children. It can offer a huge help, even though children may be learning virtually for a while.
<h4>Long-Term Food Help</h4>
Financial issues from the coronavirus may be a wakeup call that you need food assistance not just now, but possibly into the future as well. For long-term support, USA.gov offers two programs: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).

SNAP (aka food stamps) is widely popular and can give you the buying power necessary to get groceries. If accepted, you may get a card that can be swiped at participating stores to help you pay for food.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

WIC functions similarly to SNAP, but it’s intended for pregnant women or those with very young children. WIC may have more food restrictions that limit you to buying certain products. Regardless, it can help, especially since caring for young children can be quite costly.","You can’t let your home’s food levels get so low that starvation starts to creep into the picture.","2020-09-08 18:34:49",post,https://goodnesting.com/combat-covid-19-starvation-by-going-here/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1711992256.jpg,shutterstock_1711992256.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1711992256.jpg,3012,shutterstock_1711992256,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1711992256.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,combat-covid-19-starvation-by-going-here,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:45:13"
3202,"What Is A Housing Choice Voucher And Who Is Eligible?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<h4>What is the Housing Choice Voucher Program?</h4>
The Housing Choice Voucher Program is the new and more formal name for Section 8. Through this program, the federal government can provide housing on the private market that is safe, decent, and sanitary to people who are elderly, disabled, and earn a low income.

Section 8 participants can select their housing since assistance is given on their behalf. This allows you to choose between a variety of properties, such as apartments, townhomes, and even single-family homes.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Contrary to popular belief, a Section 8 recipient does not have to live in a subsidized housing project. As long as the housing you choose meets the program’s requirements, you’ll be good to go.

Although the federal government (more specifically, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD) is in charge of funding the Housing Choice Voucher Program, local public housing agencies (PHAs) administer it.

If your household qualifies for a housing voucher, you will have to look for a property where the owner agrees to participate in Section 8. The unit must also pass the PHAs health and safety standards to receive rental assistance. It is possible that you can receive a housing voucher for where you currently reside, should your landlord agree to it.

Once qualified and your housing is approved, your rent subsidy will be paid directly to the landlord from the PHA. Any unpaid difference in the rent will be your responsibility. While Section 8 housing vouchers are usually used for rentals, there are cases where families use them to purchase a home.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Are You Eligible for a Housing Choice Voucher?</h4>
Since the PHA administers Housing Choice Vouchers, they will be in charge of determining whether or not you are eligible for rental assistance. To receive a voucher, your household’s total annual gross income will be considered, as will how many people are living with you. Only citizens and specific categories of non-citizens with eligible immigration status will qualify.

Regarding income, your household will generally have to make less than 50 percent of the median income for the area where you want to live. The law requires PHAs to award 75 percent of their vouchers to applicants making less than 30 percent of the area median income. This income limit varies according to location. Your PHA will be able to provide you with this information so you can see if your income qualifies according to your family size.

When applying for a Section 8 voucher, the PHA will analyze your family composition, income, and assets. They will contact local agencies, your bank, and employer to ensure that the information you provided is accurate, and they will use this to determine the size of your voucher.

If your family qualifies, you will be placed on a waiting list. Once your turn is reached on the list, you will receive a voucher from your PHA.

What do twelve million Americans use annually to <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/how-to-apply-for-federal-student-grants-loans-and-work-study-programs/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">get fast financial help</a>? Payday loans that come equipped with ridiculously high interest rates that can lead to their long-term economic downfall.

Of course, payday loans can sometimes be the only option for short-term financing. And when you have to put food on the table and keep the lights on, getting a payday loan may be your last resort. Luckily, there’s another type of loan that can help without hurting you with ultra-high interest.

Where can you find this loan? Via the Possible Finance app, which we’ll take a closer look at now.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Short-Installment Loans from Possible Finance</h3>
A payday loan from your nearest check cashing store can lead to interest rates as high as 400%. In other words, it can help you in the short term while creating severe damage in the long run. Thanks to Possible Finance, you can get up to a $500 loan quickly minus those predatory interest rates.

What makes most people resort to payday loans? Besides being in a pinch and needing money fast, it’s bad credit. With Possible Finance, this is not an issue, since there are no credit checks.

When you get a loan from Possible Finance, you’ll be expected to pay it back within two months. This is more favorable than a payday loan, which expects faster payment that coincides with your next paycheck.

While having more time to pay back your loan is a plus, so is the effect that it has on your credit. If you pay the loan back in four payments, for example, you can build your credit score over those two months. So, not only do you get the money you need, but you also get the added benefit of building credit too.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Do you need more than two weeks to make the first payment? You can get up to 30 days to do so without incurring any fees or late-payment penalties.
<h3>How to Get up to a $500 Loan Now</h3>
The approval process with Possible Finance is straightforward. Go to the official site and download the app to your phone. From there, you’ll be led through some easy steps to apply.

Again, don’t worry if you have bad credit. You do not need a solid credit score to qualify, and you’ll also get to build your credit in the process since the company reports to all three credit bureaus.

<h3>An Example of Interest Charges</h3>
Although you can get cash quickly via the app, Possible Finance does not do it for free. As with any other loan, there are interest charges.

Here’s an example of what you’d pay on a $200 loan:
<ul>
 	<li>Amount borrowed: $200</li>
 	<li>Amount due on or before next paycheck: $57.50</li>
 	<li>Time to repay: 8 weeks</li>
 	<li>Total to repay: $230</li>
 	<li>APR: 151%</li>
</ul>
As you can see, that interest rate is higher than what you’d pay for a personal loan or by using a credit card. However, it’s lower than a payday loan that can balloon to the 400 percent ballpark.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Is getting a loan from Possible Finance the right move for you? That’s up to your needs and other options you can qualify for. As with any loan or contract, read the fine print before proceeding.","Do you need some quick cash to hold you over?

Whether you’ve just begun building your credit history or are trying to erase red flags from the past, you probably know this: Having good credit is incredibly important.

The better your credit, the easier it is to get loans that have low interest rates and offer instant purchasing power. Your cost for certain items is reduced with good credit, which is why it’s essential to start building it now.

What can you do to make yourself seem like a stable potential borrower in the eyes of lenders? Make these moves:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Increase your income</h3>
Yes, increasing your income is much easier said than done. It’s not impossible, however, and it has its benefits when it comes to credit.

If you find that your current income is getting you denied for credit, find ways to expand it, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Asking your boss for a raise at your current job</li>
 	<li>Getting a second job to fill your free time</li>
 	<li>Doing side gigs such as babysitting or lawn care</li>
</ul>
Every little bit of extra cash helps, so get creative when it comes to thinking of income-boosting opportunities. Just a small bump in what you bring home can reap considerable rewards in terms of credit approval.

Try to avoid any moves that reduce your income if you’re about to apply for a loan. If you know you are about to quit your job, for example, do it after the loan is approved. Leaving before will most likely result in rejection.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Clean up your credit</h3>
You don’t have to pay all of your outstanding debt at once. It should help to fix specific issues, though, that could be damaging your potential to receive loans.

Are you behind on any payments? Contact the creditor to work out a payment plan.

Do you have any negative information on your credit report? Get in touch with that creditor to see what it can be done to get it removed.

Since you may have more than one issue to fix, it’s best to prioritize them before getting to work. Don’t panic, either. As long as you start fixing each problem, you’ll be better off than where you were before.
<h3>Build your credit history</h3>
You may have unblemished credit because you have no history at all. This is probably true if you’re a student or have just arrived in the country.

How can you fix this problem? By applying for credit cards or loans and making sure you pay them on time.

The more history you build, the more information lenders will have on you as a borrower, and the less risk they’ll assume when granting you credit.

<h3>Pay down any existing debt</h3>
Certain loans you currently have can impact your ability to acquire others in the future. Have a strategy in place to pay down old debt, even if it means making small payments.

As you eliminate old debt, you’ll free up more monthly income that can be used towards newer loans. In doing so, you will be seen as a better potential borrower.

As you look at your monthly budget in the quest to cut costs, you’ll probably notice that you’re paying more for cable than you’d prefer. And what’s the worst part about it? The fact that you probably only watch a fraction of the channels in your lineup.

More people than ever are cutting the cord when it comes to cable. As for why, first, the prices keep rising. Second, customer satisfaction keeps dipping. And third, there are so many options that allow you to stay entertained without having to pay your cable company to do so.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Will the following free TV options give you the exact same content you enjoy via cable? Not necessarily, but the point is to be creative with your entertainment if you genuinely want to enjoy it at no cost.
<h3>Free TV Apps That Will Cut Your Monthly Cable Costs</h3>
<h4>YouTube</h4>
You’ve probably used YouTube in the past to stream music videos and comedic content, but if you look a bit deeper, you’ll realize the site can give you never-ending entertainment.

Use YouTube for educational videos. Watch hard-to-find documentaries to open your eyes to other worlds. Find free movies in high-quality. Or search for a topic, watch one video, and go down the rabbit hole that will keep you and your family glued to your screen for hours.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Crackle</h4>
Think of Crackle as Netflix, but free. It has its own original series. It has an extensive library of films from some of the biggest movie studios. And Crackle also has several classic TV shows that you and your loved ones can watch without having to pay a thing.
<h4>NewsON</h4>
As you cut the cord, you may worry about not being able to watch the news. With NewsON, you can relieve yourself of that worry.

NewsON gives you much more than just local broadcasts, as you can use it to watch what’s going on from over 275 local news channels in 160 markets.

Do you only watch the news for specific segments like sports or the weather? With NewsON, you can pick which parts to watch so you can save time but stay informed.

<h4>PBS Kids Video</h4>
You can’t leave your kids behind when cutting the cord, which is why it’s nice to know that a free app like PBS Kids Video exists.

Keep your children entertained and educated with shows like Sesame Street and Curious George. And since the app is so user-friendly, your kids can control it while you do other things.
<h4>Tubi TV</h4>
Would you watch a few minutes of advertisements if you knew you didn’t have to pay for cable? You probably would, which is why downloading the Tubi TV app is a smart move when you’re looking to save.

You’ll be surprised at how many great movies Tubi TV boasts in its collection, as it has connections to mega movie studios like MGM and Paramount.

<h4>What’s the Purpose of a Late Rent Hardship Letter?</h4>
While you could knock on your landlord’s door (if they live nearby) and discuss your situation, a hardship letter is a more formal way of explaining why you can’t pay the rent.

Since it’s a good idea to get everything in writing when it comes to something as serious as housing, the hardship letter lets you do that while also providing a convincing argument.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How to Make Your Late Rent Hardship Letter Convincing</h4>
Details are your best friend when writing this letter. The more you include, the better your chance of getting your landlord to accept your request.

It’s important to not only convey that you can’t pay the rent on time, but to also describe why you’re having this issue all of a sudden. Don’t just write that the rent will be late. Instead, explain what’s the reason for the delay.

For instance, if you’re taking home less money in your weekly paycheck, say that, but also insert any details on why your income has been reduced. Are times tough in your particular industry? Is the company you work for laying people off?

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Detailing why you can’t pay is crucial, but how you will pay later on is even more essential. This means including every step you’ve taken to boost your income or replace lost work.

Think of what your landlord’s mindset is when it comes to the rent. They simply want to get paid so they can fulfill their financial obligations.

By laying out the steps you’re taking to rectify the situation, you can put your landlord at ease, build trust, and convince them to let you pay once your money problems are corrected.

Lastly, be professional and polite in your request. If someone was demanding and rude to you while asking for a favor, would you be likely to say yes? Probably not, so don’t expect your landlord to do the same if you come off as combative in your letter or any follow-up correspondence.

3214,"Quick Guide To Getting Your $1,200 Coronavirus Stimulus Check","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<h4>Who Qualifies, and How Much Do They Get?</h4>
Eligibility for the $1,200 checks from the CARES Act is based primarily on income. Here’s a quick look at how much you can make to be eligible:

If you’re single ($1,200 check):
<ul>
 	<li>Have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $75,000.</li>
 	<li>Higher AGI, up to $99,000, qualifies for a check smaller than $1,200.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you’re married ($2,400 check per couple):
<ul>
 	<li>Have a combined AGI of less than $150,000.</li>
 	<li>Higher combined AGI, up to $198,000, qualifies for a check smaller than $2,400.</li>
</ul>
If you’re head of household (single parent with a child that lives with you at least half the year) ($1,200 check):
<ul>
 	<li>Have an AGI of less than $112,500.</li>
 	<li>Higher AGI, up to $136,500, qualifies for a check smaller than $1,200.</li>
</ul>
You can find your AGI by looking at the following:
<ul>
 	<li>2018 tax return – line 7 of your 1040 form.</li>
 	<li>2019 tax return – line 8b of your 1040 or 1040-SR form.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>What Is Used to Determine Income?</h4>
Your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, whichever is complete and most recent, will be used to determine your income and eligibility. If you did not file in either year, you might have issues getting a check. If this is the case, file your 2018 return now.

If you didn’t file but received Social Security, however, the IRS can use that information to see if you qualify.
<h4>Who Doesn’t Qualify?</h4>
Here are four cases where you won’t qualify for a coronavirus stimulus check:
<ul>
 	<li>You make too much money and surpass the income threshold.</li>
 	<li>You don’t have a Social Security number.</li>
 	<li>You’re a nonresident alien.</li>
 	<li>You were already claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do You Have to Be Unemployed to Receive a Check?</h4>
Losing your job due to COVID-19 or being unemployed does not affect your eligibility for a stimulus check, as income is the determining factor.

It can lead to even more compensation, however, as the CARES Act includes up to 13 weeks of unemployment benefits of up to $600 per week. This amount is in addition to any unemployment you receive from your state, and it even includes freelancers, gig workers, and contractors.
<h4>Can You Be Retired?</h4>
As long as your income falls within the requirements, yes, you can be retired and still receive a stimulus check.
<h4>Can You Owe Back Taxes?</h4>
Yes. As long as you filed for 2018 or 2019 and fall within the income requirements, you can get a check regardless of whether or not you owe delinquent taxes.
<h4>How Will the Funds Be Paid?</h4>
Direct deposit or check are the two forms of payment, although a prepaid debit card may be used instead of checks. Information from your latest tax return will be used.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>When Will Payments Be Processed?</h4>
Although Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin mentioned that payments would be coming within a few weeks, it could take months to get paid. The last time stimulus checks were processed in 2008, it took three months to receive payments.

Receiving an unexpected check in the mail that’s worth thousands of dollars could provide some <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/how-to-instantly-get-a-500-loan-that-builds-your-credit-too/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">much-needed financial help</a>. And while this may sound like a dream, it’s a reality for people who discover they’re owed money.
<h4>Types of Unclaimed Property</h4>
Why would somebody owe you money without you even knowing that it exists? Several possibilities could be owed to you or deceased relatives, such as:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Bank accounts</li>

 	<li>CDs</li>

 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
Each year, states receive such property that’s lost or unclaimed, and it can remain that way unless the rightful owners make the necessary moves to claim it. While this may sound complicated, finding unclaimed property is remarkably simple. Best of all, you don’t have to get off your couch to do it, as two websites will do all of the work for you.

Let’s take a look at the two sites that allow you to look for unclaimed property on both a state and national level. Once we’re done, you’ll be able to start using them to see if you have any surprises coming your way.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Finding Unclaimed Property Through Your State’s Treasury Website</h4>
You can begin your search on a state level. Instead of going to Google to look for your state’s treasury website, click here to find it via the National Association of Unclaimed Property website on Unclaimed.org.

As you’ll see on the home page, 10 percent of people have unclaimed property, so today could be your lucky day. To find your state’s program, click it on the map. You will be taken to your state’s site, which will usually be a page dedicated solely to pinpointing unclaimed property. From there, follow the directions to discover what could be yours.

You won’t have to pay a thing to search for unclaimed funds using these sites. When doing your search, think of any deceased relatives who may have property waiting for you. Search for their names and any possible misspellings. Don’t forget nicknames, either.
<h4>Using the Missing Money Website to Find Unclaimed Funds</h4>
You can also do an unclaimed property search on a national level through the Missing Money website. It’s a reliable way to find unclaimed funds quickly, and it’s easy to use, even if you’re not too tech-savvy.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

You can find national results based on a name, and you can then break that down via city or state. The results will offer details on the person’s name, where the property is from, the state where you’ll find it, and the last address. You may also see an estimate of how much the property is worth.

To claim the property, click on “Claim” and follow the directions. You will have to submit proof that the property is yours before you get to take ownership. Instructions on how to do all of this are on the site itself.","Finding out that you have unclaimed funds could be a pleasant surprise.

3219,"What Is Sweat Equity And Why Does Habitat For Humanity Require It?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Habitat for Humanity helps low-income families secure modern, efficient, and affordable housing. Contrary to popular belief, this housing is not free. Instead, new Habitat homeowners are expected to make monthly mortgage payments and contribute “sweat equity.”
<h4>What Is Sweat Equity?</h4>
As its name suggests, sweat equity basically means hard work contributed towards a project. In this case, the project is a home from Habitat for Humanity.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Thanks to the sweat equity you put into constructing the home along with other Habitat volunteers and professionals, you can go from a bunch of materials to a house that’s worth several times more.
<h4>Why Is Sweat Equity Required?</h4>
As mentioned, most recipients of Habitat for Humanity housing are low-income families. They don’t have a ton of cash to put towards a down payment on a home.

What they do have, however, is the ability to help build the home through their own labor and other contributions that are not monetary.

Since Habitat for Humanity doesn’t give away homes for free and makes them extremely affordable with low payments and deposits, it uses sweat equity to give those families more purchasing power. It’s not necessarily a form of payment, but more of a way to contribute and provide a feeling of community, which is what the program is all about.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>What Forms of Sweat Equity Are Accepted?</h4>
Habitat for Humanity knows that not everyone can provide physical labor, especially when constructing a home. To address this issue, they offer many forms of sweat equity that are acceptable.

Sure, you can do construction work or clean up a building site, but you can also perform administrative duties or work in a Habitat ReStore as well.

If you have children, they can contribute towards your sweat equity too. It won’t be via labor, but I can be through their schoolwork. For example, at one Habitat in Florida, a child’s A grade can equal one hour of sweat equity.

Habitat not only provides affordable housing, but they also help you manage your money and home via classes on things like insurance, mortgages, credit repair, safety, and maintenance.

These classes make up part of your sweat equity, but they shouldn’t be seen as work. Since they can help build a solid financial foundation for your future, they should be seen as a highly valuable education you’re getting for free.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

These classes start even before you purchase your home, which gives you a better understanding of the process. Depending on your local Habitat, classes could last well over a year.
<h4>Why Sweat Equity Is Important</h4>
The importance of sweat equity goes beyond the fact that it’s a requirement to own a Habitat house. Instead, it’s essential because it emphasizes such character traits as stability, strength, and independence.

By having a new home and the education to go with it, you can become more independent. Studies have shown this to be accurate, as many families have been able to end government assistance once they purchased their Habitat homes.","If you apply for Habitat for Humanity housing, you’ll be hearing the words “sweat equity” a lot.

3221,"5 Tips To Get The Best Refinance Rate For Your Mortgage","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

While most of the news focuses on the coronavirus outbreak and all the negatives it brings, other positive events have happened when it comes to saving you money.

One such event is the lowering of interest rates. And if you refinance your mortgage now, you can take advantage of them to <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/boost-your-monthly-budget-with-these-money-saving-tips/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">save money each month</a> for other purposes, such as padding your emergency fund or paying down debt.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here’s what you can do to help ensure you get the best refinance rate possible:
<h4>1. Check your free credit report.</h4>
When’s the last time you checked your credit report? If you haven’t done so in a while because you’re worried about the cost, know that you can get your credit report free once a year.

Why is checking your credit report so important when you’re looking to refinance your mortgage? Because the better your score, the better your interest rate, and the more money you can save each month on your house payment.

As you check your report, look for any errors. If you spot one, report it so you can get it removed. Doing so can improve your score without a ton of work involved.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Improve your credit utilization ratio.</h4>
The percentage of available credit that you use (credit utilization ratio) makes up a significant part of your credit score. By lowering it, you can improve your score to get a better refinance loan.

One way to lower your credit utilization ratio is to pay down debt. But this can be tough if you don’t have a ton of extra cash at the moment.

What’s the alternative? Call up your credit card providers and see if they can increase your available credit. If they say yes, be sure not to fall into the temptation to use that credit, as it will render this method useless in boosting your credit score.

<h4>3. Keep using credit wisely.</h4>
This may contradict with the last tip, but you should try to keep making small credit card purchases and paying them off each month. It shows you know how to manage your debt and can increase your score.
<h4>4. Reduce the term of your loan.</h4>
If you’ve currently paid 10 years into a 30-year mortgage, don’t refinance into a new loan of the same length. Instead, aim for a 15 or 20-year term to get a lower interest rate and reduce how much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan.

Will you pay a bit more each month with a shorter loan term? Sure, but you can save a ton in the long run, which makes it worth it if you can make those higher monthly payments on time.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>5. Shop around.</h4>
As obvious as this tip may seem, it’s probably the best way to see the best refinance rates that are currently available.

According to Freddie Mac, getting one more rate quote could save the average borrower $1,500 over the life of their mortgage. What happens when you shop among five lenders? You can save approximately $3,000.

When comparing rates, look at the APR (annual percentage rate). It includes the interest rate plus any extra fees, which helps you compare who truly has the best offer.","Mortgage rates haven’t been this low in 50 years, and refinancing your mortgage now could lead to lower monthly payments.

3223,"3 Housing Assistance Resources For Seniors","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<h4>The Section 202 Program</h4>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) runs Section 202, which is also called the Supportive Housing for the Elderly program.

It launched in 1959, and many consider it to be the HUD’s number one housing option for seniors since its homes are outfitted explicitly with elderly needs in mind. Since its inception, Section 202 has led to the building of over 8,000 housing projects that have allowed it to provide nearly 400,000 housing units for seniors.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

As for why Section 202 homes are a senior’s best bet, many of their homes come equipped with such features as ramps and grab rails.
Some are also fully accessible for wheelchairs.

Besides providing features that allow for increased accessibility, Section 202 housing may also help seniors interact with others via social areas for eating and mingling.

Those who live in 202 housing can rely on an on-site care coordinator to help with assistive services. While benefits vary according to location, some offer added assistance in the form of bathing, transportation, meals, medication, and daily activities to keep senior residents occupied and healthy.

The HUD makes 202 housing affordable for low-income seniors through Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRACs). In such an agreement, the senior pays 30 percent of their income towards rent, while the HUD pays the difference.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>The Section 8 Program</h4>
The HUD also offers housing assistance to qualifying seniors through its Section 8 or Housing Choice Voucher program, which is the largest of its kind.

While Section 8 was made with low-income families in mind, many seniors take advantage of its benefits to secure safe, affordable housing. In fact, about ¼ of Housing Choice Voucher recipients are seniors, which is categorized as those over the age of 62.

Although the HUD runs Section 8, local Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are responsible for working with applicants to secure the benefits they need.

As long as the housing meets requirements set by the HUD, a senior can live in an apartment, townhome, or single-family home. The rent amount includes utilities, and the senior will pay 30 percent of their income towards the bill, with the HUD funding the rest, which will be paid directly to the landlord.

Unlike 202 housing, the Housing Choice Voucher or Section 8 avenue is more geared towards seniors looking to live independently of others.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>The Section 521 Program</h4>
The HUD may be the most popular source of rent assistance for low-income families and seniors, but it isn’t the only option. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides rent assistance as well through its Rural Housing Division.

Section 521, or the Rural Rental Assistance program, subsidizes rental units for low-income residents on a smaller scale than Section 8. Some of its buildings are designed specifically for seniors, who will pay 30 percent of their income towards rent while the USDA covers the rest.

To see if this program is available in your area, contact your nearest USDA office.","Several programs offer housing assistance to seniors that can help them pay the rent and provide other benefits.

3225,"Habitat for Humanity Homeownership Qualifications","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Habitat for Humanity is a charitable organization committed to providing affordable, new homes for those in need along with rebuilding communities all across the country, and even around the world.
<h4>Housing Conditions</h4>
The first step in order to build a successful application that stands the best chances of being approved is to demonstrate that your current living conditions are inadequate and substandard such as:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Over-crowdedness - Too many inhabitants in the home as per HUD occupancy standards.</li>
 	<li>Unhygienic sanitary conditions - Improper plumbing installation along with building code violations.</li>
 	<li>Unsafe or shoddy construction - leaks in the roof or windows, unstable flooring and foundation, etc.</li>
 	<li>Exorbitant rent prices - The HUD estimates that no more than 30% of total income should be paid out for rent.</li>
</ul>
Always remain truthful in your claims. A home visit will need to be carried out by the Homeownership Services Committee in order to verify the validity of the claims and to gauge the severity of your housing needs.
<h4>Personal Requirements</h4>
The program aims to help the less fortunate at obtaining affordable housing. However the houses aren’t simply gifted to applicants either. You need to meet certain criteria based on income and job security as well such as:
<ul>
 	<li>US citizen or permanent residence</li>
 	<li>Minimum one year of steady employment</li>
 	<li>No discharged bankruptcies for the last 48 months</li>
 	<li>Must not owe non-medical debt totaling $1500</li>
 	<li>Good Credit history for underwriting purposes.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

There are also income limits to factor in which are typically based around 30-80% of the Area Median Income for the surrounding county. All figures accrued from employment, government assistance, child support, disability, etc, are totaled for the limit.

There could also be additional criteria based on local requirements within your area. Be sure to check with your local Habitat for Humanity branch for more details.
<h4>What will you pay?</h4>
The applicant is expected to cover a number of costs associated with potential homeownership such as paying for the closing fees of the home and making the monthly mortgages on the home as well.

Gift funds and donations from close friends or family can be used to help cover the necessary costs as long as there is an accompanying gift letter or evidence of transfer of funds to the applicant.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Earning Sweat Equity</h4>
Part of the program requires the applicant to be willing to work and contribute to the project by putting in hours of “sweat equity”. The work can either take form in one out of three ways:
<ul>
 	<li>Manual labor on construction sites helping to build new homes for others.</li>
 	<li>Volunteer work at the local Habitat Home Improvement Restore.</li>
 	<li>An extra pair of hands at a particular Habitat event.</li>
</ul>
It’s important to enjoy the process and not lose sight of the big picture. The “sweat equity” program usually calls for around 300 hours for a one applicant household, and around 375 hours for a two applicant one.","If you’re in need of affordable housing, you’ll want to know more about this program that  has already helped serve nearly 29 million people.","2021-06-01 20:30:15",post,https://goodnesting.com/habitat-for-humanity-homeownership-qualifications/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1321541261.jpg,shutterstock_1321541261.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1321541261.jpg,2868,shutterstock_1321541261,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1321541261.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,"Habitat for Humanity|Rental Assistance",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,habitat-for-humanity-homeownership-qualifications,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-09 13:24:16"
3228,"5 Things To Consider Before Signing A Rent-To-Own Agreement","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Before you sign that agreement, there are several things you should consider. What does it take to own a home? For most, it’s years of saving every penny just to come up with a down payment. Also, it’s doing everything possible to pay bills on time to keep that credit score high so you can secure a mortgage.

What happens in the meantime? You pay rent that probably pays your landlord’s mortgage payment. But if it was a rent-to-own deal, a portion of that rent could be going towards the purchase of the home at a later date.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

This setup could sound promising to someone looking to own a home who isn’t yet in a position to get approved for or afford a mortgage, but it does come with some catches. Here are the ones you should be aware of:
<h4>1. Many rent-to-own agreements have an upfront fee.</h4>
You may be used to paying application fees and security deposits when renting a place. With rent-to-own, there’s an upfront fee as well. Unfortunately, it’s usually nonrefundable and could be quite high.

How much can such an upfront fee cost? Sometimes it’ll set you back anywhere from 3-7 percent of the purchase price of the home. This can be a tough pill to swallow if you’re low on cash.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Your monthly payment will be higher.</h4>
A rent-to-own agreement contains two main parts to its monthly payment. The first is the rent, and the second is the amount that’ll go towards the home’s purchase.

So, let’s say you had a rent-to-own deal for $1,500 a month. If $1,200 were just for the rent, only $300 would be leftover. Would that entire $300 go towards the home’s purchase later on? Probably not, as a portion of it would go to your landlord as a “fee” for allowing the agreement.
<h4>3. The home price may fluctuate.</h4>
Real estate values don’t always go up. They may dip due to a variety of factors, and when you sign a rent-to-own agreement, you’re locked into the home’s value at that time.

How can this become problematic? Let’s say you sign an agreement today when the house is worth $200,000. In five years, when you’re ready to purchase, it may have dipped to $150,000. Due to your agreement, you will still have to pay $200,000 for the home, even though it’s now worth far less than that.

Banks will be reluctant to give you a mortgage for more than the house is worth. In other words, that decrease in value could lead to problems getting financed.

<h4>4. You will have to pay for repairs and maintenance.</h4>
You’re no longer merely renting the home under a rent-to-own agreement. And since the landlord assumes they’ll be getting rid of the property when it’s time for you to purchase it, they probably won’t pay for any repairs or maintenance. Who will? You will.

This can be a risk if you decide later on that you don’t want to purchase the home, yet invested tons of money fixing up the place.
<h4>5. Payment issues could nullify the deal.</h4>
Make a late payment or miss it completely, and you won’t get hit with a simple fee, as an average renter would. Instead, it could void your rent-to-own agreement, and you may lose all of the money towards that purchase price in the process.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Don’t let this list discourage you, as rent-to-own can make owning a home affordable. It’s just meant as a heads-up, so you know both sides of the coin when it comes to such agreements.","Can a rent-to-own agreement help you achieve your dream of owning an affordable home?","2020-09-08 21:51:59",post,https://goodnesting.com/5-things-to-consider-before-signing-a-rent-to-own-agreement/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_219665491.jpg,shutterstock_219665491.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_219665491.jpg,2827,shutterstock_219665491,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_219665491.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,5-things-to-consider-before-signing-a-rent-to-own-agreement,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-19 18:09:56"
3230,"How To Qualify For Energy Bill Assistance From LIHEAP","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you qualify for help from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and you can achieve just that.

Do you get sticker shock every time you look at your energy bill? If you’re like most, you probably do, especially during the summer or winter months. Why? Blame it on extreme cold or heat that makes your heating and cooling costs skyrocket.

The bigger your utility bills, the less money you have for other things, which is why reducing them is a must. Of course, this can be easier said than done if you don’t want to live in discomfort.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

So, other than not using your furnace or AC, what are your other options to pay less for electricity? You could install blinds, insulation, or ceiling fans, or you could see if you qualify for LIHEAP.

What does it take to get energy bill assistance from this government program? We’ll dive into that now.
<h4>What Does LIHEAP Cover?</h4>
Contrary to popular belief, LIHEAP doesn’t really cover your entire energy bill. Instead, it aims to pay for whatever your cooling or heating costs are. This means that unless there’s a direct connection between your cooling or heating systems and your water/sewer bill, they will not be paid by the program.

With that being said, LIHEAP does cover some home improvements related to heating and cooling that can help keep those costs low well into the future.

For instance, you may find that your home is not energy efficient. It may have doors or windows that aren’t properly sealed, and this is letting cold or warm air leak out of the house, which increases the workload of your AC or furnace.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

To fix this issue and cut those costs, LIHEAP, depending on where you live, could pay for you to seal your doors or windows. They may also pay for insulation installation, or even help you repair or replace your AC or furnace.
<h4>How Much Money Can You Make and Still Qualify for LIHEAP?</h4>
Although the federal government presides over the program, each state which administers LIHEAP has its own rules. On average, you can’t make more than 150% of the federal poverty level. A state median poverty level may also be taken into account to determine eligibility.

To see where you stand, contact your local office.
<h4>Will Receiving Other Government Benefits Disqualify You?</h4>
Luckily, receiving other forms of government assistance will not prevent you from receiving LIHEAP, as the opposite is true. Receiving aid from SNAP, SSI, TANF, or Veteran’s benefits may help you qualify automatically for the program.

If you live in subsidized/public housing and are renting, you may qualify for LIHEAP as well.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

3234,"Lower Your Electric Bill By Making These Purchases For Your Home","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

As they say, you have to spend money to make money. While that may mostly be true in business, it’s also true when it comes to your home-related expenses.

There are several investments you can make right now that can lower your electric bill. Here are some of the best monthly money-savers that can make your home more energy-efficient:
<h3>1. Snag some fans</h3>
Yes, an air conditioner can make your home completely comfortable as it cools it down. But that comfort can come at quite the cost. To reduce that cost while keeping your home cool, invest in some fans.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Ceiling fans are particularly useful since they work well in both the summer and winter. In the summer, set the fan’s switch to a counterclockwise rotation. This will bring the cold air down. In the winter, set it to a clockwise rotation. This will pull the cold air up while pushing warm air down for maximum comfort.

If ceiling fans are too messy or expensive to install, pedestal fans, box fans, or any other type of fan. The point is to stay comfortable while cutting those electricity costs, which is what fans are great at doing.
<h3>2. Buy blackout curtains</h3>
If you live in a top-floor apartment that gets pounded by sunlight, investing in some blackout curtains can save the day. Not only will they keep glaring sunlight from making it hard to see, but they’ll also keep your place cooler, so your fans and AC don’t have to work so hard.

Since blackout curtains can be costly, you probably won’t want them for every single window in your home. Instead, place them where you know sunlight hits the hardest. Even a few blackout curtains could make a big difference in your monthly bill.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Look for new light bulbs</h3>
Are there certain lights that you always use? You’ll want to make them as energy-efficient as possible, so check which type of bulbs they are using.

You can save energy and get a longer life out of LED bulbs, but they are one of the more costly options. As long as you can buy some, however, replacing a few highly-used bulbs with these more efficient options can lead to monthly savings.
<h3>4. Buy dryer balls</h3>
You can reduce how long your dryer runs by tossing some dryer balls into the mix. Just how effective are they? Effective enough that you can lower drying time by 25%.

Sure, they will make your dryer a bit louder as they bounce around and do their job. But the savings are well worth it, and you’ll find that they’re quite an inexpensive addition to your monthly money-saving efforts.

<h3>5. Keep it coming with those filters</h3>
Depending on where you live, air conditioning can be a colossal necessity. With that necessity comes cost, however, and you want to do everything you can to protect your investment.

What’s one of the easiest ways to ensure your AC runs as it should and lasts long? Change your filters regularly, which is about every month or so.

The more clogged your filter gets, the harder your AC has to work to keep your home comfortable. If it has to work too hard for a prolonged period, it could call it quits and require a replacement worth thousands of dollars.

Luckily, AC filters are affordable and easy to replace, so don’t forget this preventative maintenance move. It can keep more money in your pocket in both the short and long term.

3236,"How To Transform Everyday Skills Into Making Money Online","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Take a minute to contemplate all the things you do every single day. As you start to look closer, you may realize that you have specific skills that are “job-like.”

For instance, you’re reading this article right now. That takes a particular skill. If you type something up to a friend, that takes skill too. And so on.

Although these little skills and tasks may seem mundane, some people will pay you to do them. Why would anyone pay for such things? Because they usually don’t have time to do it themselves, and that’s where you can come in handy.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Before we begin looking at online jobs you can get by applying your everyday skills, let’s talk about competition.

The Internet gives people all over the world the opportunity to work from home. In other words, there is competition in this online job space.

Does this mean you won’t get hired? No. It just means you must be patient if you’re first starting, so don’t get down if you don’t get hired instantly.

With that out of the way, let’s look at some simple online jobs that can help you start stacking cash from the comfort of your couch.
<h3>If You Can Read and Are a Perfectionist, Become a Proofreader.</h3>
Are you good at spotting spelling and grammar errors? Are you the type of person who finds spelling errors on a menu and points them out to the manager? If so, you can get paid by proofreading text for clients.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Proofreading jobs are all over the Net. Search for them via Google, or sign up to freelance sites like Upwork and Fiverr, and you’ll see them in scores.

If someone asks for your specific experience and you don’t have any, offer up a freebie. Tell them you’ll proofread a quick piece at no cost. If the client likes your work, they can hire you and start paying for the service.

This freebie offer is a great way to get your foot in the door with any online job, so try it regardless of what your skill or service you’re providing.

Once you get that first client, you can build your portfolio and profile. You can then ask them for referrals via word of mouth. To entice them into giving you other clients, you can offer a discount on your regular price as an incentive.
<h3>If You Can Listen and Type, Become a Transcriptionist.</h3>
Do your friends say you’re a great listener? Take that skill (and yes, it is undoubtedly a skill) and transform it into transcribing work.

When you transcribe, you’ll be asked to listen carefully to a piece of audio and type what you hear. It’s a rather simple gig that lets you set your hours and get paid up to $25 per hour.

<h3>If You Can Type, Do Data Entry.</h3>
It may not be the most fun job in the world, but data entry can pay the bills. As long as you can type and are accurate at entering data into spreadsheets and the like, clients will pay you for it.

If You Can Multitask and Organize, Become a Virtual Assistant.

Do you juggle several tasks every day like paying bills, answering the phone, writing emails, etc.? Then you can become someone else’s virtual assistant and do the same for them.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

It’s like being a personal assistant without the need to:
<ol>
 	<li>Have a formal interview.</li>
 	<li>Get dressed in business clothing every day.</li>
 	<li>Sit in an office for hours on end.</li>
</ol>
In short, you can get around the same pay without the pain associated with a typical job.","Think you’re underqualified for online jobs? Think again.

The Internet has its good and bad, and that’s especially true when it comes to job opportunities.

On one side, you have your scammy jobs that aim to get your personal information so that they can sell you things. On the other side, you have legitimate clients with needs, and many are willing to offer attractive pay to the people who can satisfy them.

While you may need certain skills to get some of the gigs and jobs in this list, remember that everyone has to start somewhere.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Unlike regular jobs where you have to interview in person, getting hired online can be easier and quicker. With that being said, let’s look at what work pays well, so you can start applying today.
<h3>Micro-Freelancer</h3>
Can you type? Do you know two languages, which gives you the ability to translate? Are you good at editing pictures and graphic design? Do you have a great voice that would sound good in commercials? If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you could get start getting paid for those skills today.

If you have a skill that’s not listed above, guess what? It doesn’t matter since almost every skill you can think of is needed by clients, and you can get paid for providing them.

Fiverr is an excellent example of a site that connects clients and freelancers. Head on over now and have a look. Once there, you’ll notice a lot of skills that people are making money off of, and some of them you may have.

Don’t let Fiverr’s reputation fool you, either. Some say it’s a site with gigs for $5 each, but as you browse, you’ll notice some gigs worth hundreds of dollars or more.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Search Engine Evaluator</h3>
Have you ever searched for anything on the Internet? You probably have, and you may do it daily. In other words, you already have experience in this field, and you can transform that into income as a search engine evaluator.

Search engines need feedback on their user experience. As an evaluator, you’ll be giving that feedback and performing tasks that can result in up to $15 per hour in pay.

To find these gigs, enter the job title into – you guessed it – a search engine. You should find some opportunities. You can also go here and see what’s available.

<h3>Social Media Manager</h3>
If you have a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account, you manage social media. Sure, it’s yours that you’re managing, but you still perform that task frequently.

Many companies hire outsiders to manage their social media for them, and you could get hired too. What’s the pay? It averages between $15 and $40, which isn’t bad for doing a task that’s not overly complicated.

You can find social media manager jobs via search engines or sites like Upwork and Fiverr. You can also go to local businesses, like your gym, and ask if they need help. Going after the gig this way gives you an instant edge over applying online, so don’t be shy and try it.

Being stuck inside is bad enough, but could you imagine doing it without phone or Internet service? That’s the reality for some families, but if you qualify for Lifeline, you could get service at a very affordable discount, or even free now and well into the future.
<h4>What Is Lifeline?</h4>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created Lifeline as a way to make phone and Internet more affordable for low-income consumers. The program achieves this goal by offering discounts up to $9.25 on phone or Internet bills, as well as free cell phones or service in select cases.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

As an example, here’s what Assurance Wireless offers for those who qualify for Lifeline:
<ul>
 	<li>An Android smartphone at no cost</li>
 	<li>Unlimited free texts</li>
 	<li>Multiple GB of free data</li>
 	<li>Free voice minutes</li>
 	<li>Free call waiting, caller ID, and voicemail</li>
</ul>
While cell phones and the Internet used to be thought of as a luxury, they’re now a necessity for many everyday functions, which is why Lifeline is so essential for the low-income community.

It’s worth noting that although Lifeline offers discount phone or Internet service, a household cannot enjoy both benefits simultaneously. One or the other must be chosen, and when it comes to phone service, you can have either a landline or cell service through the program.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Lifeline Eligibility Requirements</h4>
A household can qualify for Lifeline either based on income or the use of certain assistance programs.

In terms of income, a household must earn 135% or less than the federal poverty guidelines, which will be verified via proof of income. You can use a tax return or consecutive pay stubs to prove that you meet this requirement.

If you or anyone in your household, including a child or dependent, participates in any of the following, that can help you qualify for Lifeline as well:
<ul>
 	<li>Medicaid</li>
 	<li>Food stamps</li>
 	<li>Public housing assistance</li>
 	<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>

Living on federally recognized Tribal lands can yield an extra $25 percent discount off your monthly bill, which would equal a max of $34.25 in savings.

As mentioned, Lifeline discounts are limited to one per household. Failure to adhere to this rule could lead to criminal or civil penalties.
<h4>How to Apply for Lifeline</h4>
You have three options when it comes to applying for Lifeline benefits. The slowest method is by mail. Applying online can result in immediate approval, which is why it’s recommended.

You can also contact an Internet or phone company and ask if they’re affiliated with Lifeline. There are several companies that provide Lifeline services, so you’re bound to find one that can fulfill your needs.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

To begin the Lifeline application process, go here, where you’ll find all the information you need to get started. When applying, you may need certain documentation handy, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Driver’s license or government-issued ID</li>
 	<li>Program award letters for Medicaid, SNAP, etc.</li>
 	<li>Income eligibility documents like pay stubs, last year’s tax return, child support award, etc.</li>
</ul>","Cutting your phone or Internet costs via Lifeline could make it easier to cope with COVID-19’s negative financial impact.

3244,"Improve Your Home With These Government-Sponsored Grants","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

What keeps most people from making improvements to their home? A lack of money. Luckily, such a shortage can be overcome if you meet specific requirements that can land you a home repair grant from the government.

What exactly is this type of grant and how can you find one? Let’s take a look at that now so you can see the various funding options that are out there.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Is a Home Improvement Grant?</h4>
The government offers home improvement grants (sometimes called home repair grants) to people looking to upgrade their properties. These offerings come at the municipality, state, or federal level.

If requirements are met, the person who receives the grant does not have to pay it back. In short, getting a grant to boost your home’s features can be hand without pulling a penny out of your pocket.

The competition for grants can be fierce since they virtually offer free funding. As long as you’re looking to improve your property to make it more livable, less hazardous, or safer, getting a grant may be in your future.
<h4>Requirements for Home Repair Grants</h4>
Since grants are so limited and high in demand, you must meet several requirements to be eligible for one. Here are some examples of what may be required to prove your eligibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Proof of income</li>
 	<li>Documentation showing financial need</li>
 	<li>Home condition reports</li>
 	<li>Estimated project costs</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Each grant will have its own set of requirements. Where you live and what you propose to do will weigh heavily in your chances for receiving a grant.

Most eligibility requirements can be found online. The following links will lead you to the official sites of some of the most popular grants for home improvement:
<ul>
 	<li>HUD Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)</li>
 	<li>USDA Single Family Housing Repair Loans &amp; Grants</li>
 	<li>VA Housing Grant for Disabled Veterans</li>
 	<li>HOME Investment Partnerships Program</li>
 	<li>Housing Improvement Program for American Indian and Alaskan Natives</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Find Home Improvement Grants</h4>
The links above are just a handful of grant resources you can find online to improve your home. Your local Housing and Urban Development (HUD) office will have plenty of information on home repair grants as well, such as the aforementioned HOME Investment Partnerships Program.

3246,"Where To Find Short Term Money","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Short term money is the stuff to remedy emergency expenses. These options are important when traditional options (such as a bank loan or credit cards) are unavailable and the financial stability of a family may be at risk. In this guide, we offer information about where to find short term money, how to apply for a loan, which alternatives exist, and more.

<h4>Applying for a Personal Loan</h4>
The first step that must be taken when considering a payday loan is to verify whether the state the family lives in allows the practice altogether. Living in Georgia, New York, New Jersey, Arizona, North Carolina, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia and the District of Columbia do not have access to payday loans due to them being illegal. However, there are several alternatives that borrowers can take advantage of, some of which we’ll explore further ahead.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

The second step for borrowers living in states that allow payday loans is to find an adequate lender that can supply them with the amount of money they need. These can be storefronts located close to where the borrower lives, or a company offering their services online. Regardless, most lenders charge a percentage or dollar amount per $100 borrowed, which is then used to calculate the annual percentage rate (APR) that must be provided to the borrower before the agreement is made.

Most individual companies manage their own set of rules to determine who qualifies for a loan. However, they generally require their customers to have an active bank, credit union or prepaid card account. Some lenders ask for proof or verification of income from a job or any other source. Borrowers are required by law to provide a valid identification document that certifies they are at least 18 years old.

After a lender has been selected, the final step is to determine the amount that will be borrowed and when will the money be paid back. Most payday loans have very short term that don’t extend beyond 14 days and usually coincide with payday. A personal loan however, will have longer repayment periods and often more favorable terms.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Unclaimed Money</h4>
You may be owed money and not even know it. The source may have been a tax refunds or wages that were paid but never collected. In these cases, we’re talking about unclaimed money. Although the government does not operate a centralized location to find out if someone has unclaimed money, there are some state and agency specific resources that help figure out if this is the case.

People interested in getting back any unclaimed money they’re owed can make use of the local registries usually available in their state. Checking for tax refunds with the Internal Revenue System (IRS) or bank failures with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are good ways to start. Members of credit unions that have failed can search for unclaimed deposits, while people enrolled in Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits can look for unclaimed life insurance funds.
<h4>Payday Loans</h4>
Payday loans, also known as payroll loans or cash advance loans, used to be more accessible but recent regulation into excessively high interest rates have cast them into bad light. They involve a lender providing a short-term unsecured loan to be repaid by the borrower when the next payday comes. Lenders usually request verification of employment or income (such as pay stubs or bank statements) to assure that the borrower is in a position to pay back the money. Some companies prefer to skip the verification process while others manage their own underwriting criteria.

Payday loans have existed in some form since the Great Depression. However, their use and reach was limited until the 1980s, when small community banks collapsed due to financial deregulation. This event allowed lending institutions to expand and fill the void. Payday loans have since become illegal in many states.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Other Alternatives</h4>
If not a personal loan, and without any unclaimed money, accessing short term funds from a credit union may fit your needs. Credit Unions provide a variety of financing options to their members. If you’re not already part of a credit union, it could take several weeks to access these funds.

Most credit unions ask interested parties to donate a small amount of money to a non-profit organization to get a membership. After this is complete, new members will have access to several financing options designed to help them cover all sorts of expenses. A popular and relatively new offering by credit unions is the Salary Advance Loan, which works like payday loans but with lower interest rates. Other loans designed to cover specific expenses such as monthly rent or vehicle repairs are also available. Some credit unions go as far as to offer low interest rate mortgages, credit cards and other forms of financial instruments to help their members.

Another way to receive short term funding is through a relatively new financial instrument called the Small Dollar Loan (SDL). It was pioneered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through a two-year pilot program in collaboration with more than 30 state and local banks across the country. These loans are designed to serve as a bridge between payday loans and standard bank loans by offering the borrower with an annual interest rate (ART) of 36 percent or less and a term of 90 days or more.

If the purpose of the loan is to cover car repairs or to purchase a new vehicle, the best option would be to apply for an auto loan. There are countless institutions around the country that offer attractive financing options tailored to allow their customers to repair their damaged vehicle or acquire the transportation method they need to stay at work.","When in a bind there are a few dependable places to find quick money but you have to play it smart.","2020-09-01 03:32:28",post,https://goodnesting.com/where-to-find-short-term-money/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shorttermmoney_img01.jpg,shorttermmoney_img01.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shorttermmoney_img01.jpg,2815,shorttermmoney_img01,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shorttermmoney_img01.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Work From Home",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,where-to-find-short-term-money,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-19 18:25:48"
3248,"How To Write A Hardship Letter","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

In general, financial institutions need to know why someone is unable to continue paying before they agree to more generous terms. They also need to make sure the borrower has implemented correcting measures without success.

A hardship letter accomplishes this purpose, helping families inform financial institutions that an adjustment to loan or mortgage terms is needed. Writing it may not be the most pleasant experience, but it provides many benefits when done right.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

In this article, we discuss what is a hardship letter, under which circumstances is it beneficial to use it and things to consider during the writing process.
<h4>A hardship letter is a document explaining why a person is no longer able to meet financial responsibilities</h4>
A hardship letter is a written document where an individual makes an argument in favor of a specific outcome. To achieve this result, people have to make sure the hardship letter includes several things. First, the letter has to explain in detail how the individual reached financial hardship. This involves talking about personal decisions, external factors, and more.

For example, a family interested in refinancing their mortgage should explain real estate market changes in the area, and how it affected the value of their property.

An individual who wants to redefine the terms of a loan should explain what circumstances are now affecting their ability to cover payments. Sometimes, financial institutions require documentation supporting the claims made in the hardship letter, such as statistical data from government agencies or an unemployment certificate.

Second, the individual should discuss what they have done to improve the situation. Proving that hardship exists is often not enough to obtain more generous terms from a lender. They need examples of how the individual has tried to remain financially responsible, such as by reducing expenses or joining job search platforms. Finally, the letter needs to discuss how attempts at improving the situation have failed.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Hardship is defined by events which negatively affect someone’s ability to cover payments</h4>
There are many situations which can be considered as financially disadvantageous. For example, a family who got a mortgage to purchase a $200,000 home in 2008 might be in a difficult sport today if their house is now valued at $120,000.

The house has lost half of its value, but the same amount of money is still owed. This situation alone is not enough to declare hardship. In general, financial institutions decline requests based solely on numbers because it may represent an attempt to renegotiate loan terms or perform a strategic foreclosure.

A hardship letter needs to explain instead why the person no longer can afford to pay their $200,000 mortgage. It should elaborate on which events made it so that borrowers no longer have the ability to cover payments on time.

Unemployment, medical emergencies, reduced annual income, divorce or family separation, military service and incarceration are some events accepted by financial institutions as severe enough to merit reconsideration of loan or mortgage terms. Families under adjustable-rate loans may also qualify if the rates change significantly.
<h4>Writing a hardship letter can be depressing, but it needs to go into detail about your financial problems.</h4>
People who are about to go through difficult events such as a bankruptcy or foreclosure have a compelling story to tell. A hardship letter should make sure the financial institution understands these difficulties.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

In simple but sincere words, the borrower has to explain how things went south and what measures they took to correct the situation. Describing the impact of each event is an efficient way to paint the correct picture. Relying on numbers is important to help lenders understand how severe the situation is and put items such as income loss and negative cash flow into context.

A customer who had to borrow from their credit card to cover payments should explain so in the letter, including detailed information such as the exact amount and credit line source. In some cases, borrowers have to rely on family members or withdraw from retirement savings accounts to stay afloat. These events should be mentioned in a hardship letter.

Some people may feel tempted to end the letter on a positive and optimistic note. However, doing so might have negative effects, as the financial institution will use any evidence of potential recovery as an excuse to deny refinancing a loan or mortgage.

As discussed above, it is important to mention which measures were taken to improve finances, but the person must be clear that all attempts have failed. Otherwise, the bank will ask the borrower to come back later. The purpose of a hardship letter is to show the financial institution that refinancing the loan or mortgage is the only way to guarantee payments.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Before writing a hardship letter, people have to keep in mind that financial institutions only care about getting paid. Protecting your finances is not their responsibility.

As a result, the letter must convince the bank that approving your request is the only way to keep payments on schedule. It may be depressing to write a compelling hardship letter, but if it gives you access to better loan terms it will be worth the trouble.","When financial difficulty comes and you need to refinance a loan or mortgage, writing a hardship letter might be part of the process.","2020-09-01 03:05:58",post,https://goodnesting.com/how-to-write-a-hardship-letter/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hardshipLetter01.jpg,hardshipLetter01.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hardshipLetter01.jpg,2765,hardshipLetter01,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hardshipLetter01.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,how-to-write-a-hardship-letter,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:54"

3254,"5 Tricks That Will Save You A Small Fortune","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Among them are stocking their fridges to reduce energy bills or taking advantage of special mortgage refinance programs.

In this article, we explore some money saving tricks that can help homeowners and renters. When used together, they can help families save as much as $2,000 each month. In some cases, they can also help them <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/how-to-convert-your-unwanted-stuff-into-cash-online/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">make some extra money</a>.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Reduce your utility bill</h4>
Utility bills are one of the largest expenses families have to deal with every month. However, there are a few ways diligent households can slash these costs significantly, thus saving thousands of dollars each year.

The first thing households can do to reduce their utility bills is to make sure no electric or electronic device is plugged when unused. Except for vital appliances such as fridges and air conditioners, most devices can be safely unplugged. Unplugging them can save households between $100 and $200 each year. Doing so also protects appliances and other devices from power surges, which in certain circumstances can cause them to become permanently damaged.

Next on the list is replacing normal light bulbs with energy efficient ones. Incandescent light bulbs consume much more energy than compact fluorescent bulbs, known as CFLs, or LED bulbs. For example, running a single incandescent bulb five hours a day for a year costs around $16. By comparison, a LED bulb that runs five hours a day for a year will cost only $6.

On average, a house has around 45 light bulbs, which means that homeowners and renters can save up to $450 each year just by replacing their bulbs. An important side effect of replacing incandescent light bulbs is that CFLs and LED bulbs produce at least 75 percent less heat. As a result, HVAC and air conditioners will have to spend less energy maintaining temperatures, thus further reducing electricity bills and extending their life.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Finally, people can also rely on home automation and smart devices to make sure energy is used as efficiently as possible. It is quite common for families to leave the TV on when no one is watching, for example. Timers and smart outlets can automatically turn off devices under certain circumstances or at designated times. Smart thermostats can also help manage energy more efficiently by adjusting temperatures while the house is empty.

These recommendations may seem small on their own. However, when added up, they can help families reduce their utility bills by up to $50 each month.
<h4>Save money with a FMERR mortgage refinance</h4>
Homeowners who have a mortgage with Freddie Mac can save thousands of dollars a month through the Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance Program or FMERR. This program was created after the Great Recession to help borrowers whose homes had lost value, or those who despite paying their mortgage on time had not benefited from rising home values. When this happens, homeowners often find themselves underwater, which means that their outstanding loan balance is higher than the home’s value.

In either case, homeowners would not have enough equity to qualify for a standard refinance. In general, lenders require at least 20 percent equity before approving a mortgage refinance. The Freddie Mac Relief Refinance Program has no such requirements, helping homeowners who are stuck with high interest rates. Those who refinance using the FMERR can lower their interest rates by as much as two points. For example, a homeowner who took a $200,000 mortgage to buy a home with 6 percent interest would pay $1,200 each month. By refinancing through FMERR, they can lower interest rates to 4 percent. Their new monthly payment amount would be around $900, and they would save around $100,000 in interest paid over the life of their loan. As a result, they can save as much as $3,600 each year.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

The Freddie Mac Relief Refinance Program does have some unique requirements potential applicants must meet. For example, homeowners must be in time with their monthly payments,their loan must have originated on or after October 1, 2017, and at least 15 months must have passed since the first mortgage payment was made. This means that homeowners who purchased homes before October 2017 are not eligible. Also, those who are must hurry up, as this program will end in September 2019. However, the federal government will most likely announce new programs to help homeowners who are underwater.
<h4>Rent out spare rooms or spaces</h4>
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, around 36 percent of the population is renting rather than owning. Yet a significant number of homeowners still have unused space inside their homes. Taking advantage of this unused space has become more common as homeowners seek new ways to make money. Renting a room to tenants and tourists can help families make an extra $700 each month, or more, depending on their location and which other benefits they offer to potential renters.

However, renting rooms is not the only way to make money with a home. In some cases, families can take advantage of services like AirBnB to not only rent rooms but also entire properties for weeks or even months. Why use AirBnB instead of becoming a traditional landlord? Because, on average, AirBnB renters rean up to five times more money than traditional renters. Also, homeowners who rent through AirBnB do not have to follow local regulations when setting up prices.

To market on AirBnB, homeowners must create and account and meet other quality guidelines. The company has minimum requirements landlords must meet before their properties become eligible for the service. Once they do, landlords can start receiving tenant applications through the service.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

There are some things prospective landlords must consider. First, income receive through AirBnB must be reported to the IRS just like any other irregular job, such as driving for Uber. This means that landlords must make sure their pricing is enough to cover repairs, maintenance and improvements while still generating some profit after taxes are paid. In some states, AirBnB tenants can deduct these expenses from their taxes, increasing the amount of money they can pocket.

Second, prospective landlords must inform themselves about local regulations against such practices. In Florida, for example, state law and regulations are blurry and tenants are often asked to vacate properties if they rented through AirBnb or similar platforms. Such laws are put in place to protect traditional tenants and keep rent prices from rising. Prospective landlords must keep an eye out to avoid potential legal issues.

Finally, tenants who prefer not to rent bedrooms can choose to rent storage areas or garage space instead. Short-term rental platforms are not focused on bedrooms and apartments exclusively.
<h4>Stock up your fridge</h4>
Fridges operate just like air conditioners. This means that the closest the temperature of a space is to the desired target, the fewer energy these appliancers will have to spend in the process. An air conditioner cooling or heating an empty house with open windows will require more energy than a house with closed windows and full of objects.

The same principle applies to fridges. An empty fridge will use more energy to maintain lower temperatures than a full fridge. The reason is that food placed in the fridge maintains lower temperatures more efficiently and for longer periods than air does. Also, opening an empty fridge will make cool air inside interact with warm air outside, raising temperatures significantly. This does not happen with food and other products, as solid objects are more resistant to fast temperature changes.

One way to make sure fridges are using as little energy as possible is to keep them stocked up as much as possible. Anything that can be stored in the fridge should be placed there. This includes vegetables, fruits, and other perishable foods. If there isn’t enough food around, families can use pitchers of water instead, which are as efficient and do not require going to the grocery store. Also, it is recommended to set the fridge’s temperature to between 36 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit for maximum efficiency.

<h4>Save on home repairs</h4>
Many homeowners are unaware of the fact that their home insurance will not cover the cost of replacing a broken home appliance. Also, most do not have the cash to cover this expense when it takes place. The best way to be protected against such an emergency is by purchasing a home warranty program.

Home warranties, also known as home service contracts, are insurance policies that cover the cost of maintaining and repairing malfunctioning home appliances. Some policies even cover a potential replacement. Families can save thousands of dollars in expensive home repairs with the right home warranty plan.

According to a Nielsen report released in 2010, the average person visits 89 websites every month. They could make up to $30 per hour by signing up to something called website testing.

There are several legitimate companies that pay people to test websites. This includes UserTesting.com, which helps big companies like Facebook and Walmart test new website features before they are released to the public. In this article, we explain how website testing works and how much money can you expect to make.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is website testing?</h4>
Website testing is a tool that most companies use to understand how users interact with their websites. This allows them to make corrections when some features are not working as intended. Facebook and Twitter, for example, rely on user testing to make sure their websites are working properly.

Website testing survey jobs have been around for years. Most large companies used to collect data from in-person focus groups. However, internet usage has sunk in so thoroughly that it no longer makes financial sense to require in person responses. Companies now hire remote participants to test their websites and provide valuable feedback.
<h4>How does website testing work?</h4>
One company, UserTesting, asks testers to record a 20-minute video where they test all or some features available on a specific website. Tasks may include opening specific pages or filling out forms. The nature and amount of tasks per test will depend on the type of website being tested. UserTesting in particular offers a guarantee that completing a test will not take more than 20 minutes.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How much can you earn with user testing?</h4>
How much can people earn depends on which company they work for. For example, UserTesting.com pays $10 per test. A user who completes tests one after the other can earn $30 per hour. People who complete tests one hour per day, five days a week, can make around $600 per month. Respondent, another user testing platform, pays $140 per hour on average. However, the selection process is more rigorous.

UserTesting.com pays its testers through Paypal. Other website testing companies may use other methods such as Payoneer. Also, anyone looking to test websites for cash should be aware that demand for testers tends to change. It is very likely that one tester may make varying amounts from month to month despite their being available to work.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

In some cases, testers may spend several days without any assignments to complete. It can be risky to rely on these sorts of jobs to cover basic expenses or monthly bills. However, it may be useful to pay off debt or increase savings.","These websites you like, they make money every time you visit them.

There is some good news, though. Government programs exist to help pay phone bills, medical bills, and other expenses that they are unable to pay. In this article, we’ll reveal which programs can provide a period of relief from paying bills.
<h4>Help Paying Your Phone Bill</h4>
Lifeline is a U.S. federal government program that provides landline and cellphone bill payment assistance to qualifying low-income families across the country. Lifeline accounts are handled by local providers who also offer free cell phones to families who need them most.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

In addition to Lifeline, the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (NDBEDP) assists low-income citizens who have combined vision and hearing loss.

You can learn more about this unique program by visiting the NDBEDP page on the Federal Communication Commission's website.
<h4>Help Paying Your Energy Bill</h4>
Energy bills can be overwhelming for many low-income families. To alleviate this financial burden, the federal government established the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to offer subsidies for power bills. Eligible U.S. citizens and legal aliens may apply to receive the benefits of this program if they need assistance with:
<ul>
 	<li>Paying cooling and heating bills</li>
 	<li>Emergencies, such as utility shutoffs</li>
 	<li>Low-cost home improvements, known as weatherization, that make your home more energy-efficient and lower your utility bills</li>
</ul>
To learn more about this program and to see if you’re eligible, visit LIHEAP’s official site.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Help Paying Your Medical Bills</h4>
Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are two government programs that offer assistance with medical bills. Along with Medicare, they provide much-needed subsidies to more than 60 million Americans who would otherwise be left without access to quality health insurance.

Local social security offices have detailed information about which programs are available in the state to help reduce medical costs. You can find your closest local social security office here.

Looking for better health insurance programs is always a good idea. If your current plan is no longer affordable, it may be time to find a cheaper option. Websites like HealthCare.gov offer affordable health insurance plans for people who are not eligible for Medicare or currently don’t receive health coverage through their employer. The marketplace is also available to self-employed citizens and people looking for a better option than the one provided by their employer.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Other Bill Payment Assistance Programs</h4>
The federal government can help you pay other bills too, with programs that include:
<ul>
 	<li>Prescription medication aid, which offers financial support to people who cannot pay for their medication.</li>
 	<li>Rental assistance, which helps low-income families find affordable housing in selected properties across the country.</li>
 	<li>Mortgage assistance, which helps families refinance their mortgage to obtain better interest rates and more flexible options.</li>

3263,"Current COVID-19 Stimulus Assistance And What Could Be Coming","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here are some ways to do so that come via the coronavirus stimulus package and other moves.

The recently passed Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was created to help everyday citizens stay afloat. While it can’t replace a full-time job you lost, it can give you some much-needed aid to continue feeding your family and meet other expenses until we pass from the “new normal” to full regularity.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Although $1,200 stimulus checks may have taken the spotlight, there are other benefits you can receive from the CARES Act worth mentioning. Here are a few:
<h4>Stimulus Checks</h4>
As mentioned, the $1,200 stimulus checks are the highlight of the CARES Act. Adults making up to $75,000 will get $1,200, while couples will get $2,400 if they file jointly and earn up to $150,000. Children will yield an additional $500 each for the home.

Adults can make up to $99,000 and still qualify for a check smaller than $1,200. The same holds for couples making up to $198,000.

2018 or 2019 filed tax returns will automatically be used to calculate payments, and there is no need to apply. To check your stimulus payment status, go here.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Unemployment Benefits</h4>
Full-time, part-time, and even gig workers who lost their jobs, income, or clients due to COVID-19 may qualify for unemployment assistance.

If eligible, you could receive $600 in unemployment benefits per week for up to 13 weeks. This is in addition to the benefits you receive from the state.

To apply for this benefit, you will have to go through your state’s unemployment program.
<h4>Student Loans</h4>
If your loan is held by the federal government and has the United States Department of Education listed as the lender, you can enjoy temporary student loan relief through the CARES Act.

This relief offers forbearance and zero-percent interest until the end of September.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Mortgages and Evictions</h4>
If you live in a building where the owners have federally-backed mortgages, you cannot be evicted if you fail to pay rent for 120 days.
Any penalties or fees for nonpayment during this time are also prohibited.

Also, if you have a federally-backed mortgage and lost income due to the coronavirus, you may qualify for a forbearance of 60 days on your mortgage payments. If that is not enough, you can extend the forbearance for a maximum of four additional 30-day periods. Your lender cannot charge any fees or penalties during this time, either.

To qualify for this forbearance on your mortgage, contact your lender directly and tell them how COVID-19 has negatively impacted your finances and ability to pay.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Is More Aid on the Way?</h4>
As for additional assistance that may come shortly, Congress could pass a second stimulus package in June. What could that second round of stimulus contain?

Some believe another $1,200 check is on the way for those who qualify, plus additional money for children in the household. A new stimulus may also extend the $600 weekly unemployment benefit until January of next year. Bonuses or hazard pay for essential workers is another possibility.","Are you seeking avenues to shore up your finances due to job or income loss as a result of COVID-19?","2021-06-01 20:40:36",post,https://goodnesting.com/current-covid-19-stimulus-assistance-and-what-could-be-coming/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1707510022.jpg,shutterstock_1707510022.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1707510022.jpg,2881,shutterstock_1707510022,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1707510022.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Rental Assistance",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,current-covid-19-stimulus-assistance-and-what-could-be-coming,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:45:25"
3265,"Buying Or Renting? A Government-Approved Housing Counselor Can Help You","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here are various ways in which a counselor can help you fulfill your housing needs.
<h4>When You’re Looking to Buy a Home</h4>
Being a first-time homebuyer can be exciting and scary at the same time. While you may look forward to moving into your first home, the process that it takes to get there may seem incredibly intimidating and lengthy.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

With a HUD-approved housing counselor, the first-time home buying experience becomes much simpler. Much of this is due to being well-informed on what buying your first home entails, which is done via in-person counseling or resources like classes and informational videos that can teach you:
<ul>
 	<li>How to determine how much home you can afford and how much you’ll need to save for your down payment.</li>
 	<li>The mortgage application process, including the types of mortgages and how to choose a lender.</li>
 	<li>Tips to ensure there’s always room in your monthly budget for your mortgage payment.</li>
 	<li>Everything to expect at closing.</li>
</ul>
While this service can help a first-time homebuyer, existing homeowners looking to move can solicit the aid of a counselor too.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

How much of a difference can a government-approved housing counselor make? When it comes to making your dream come true of owning your first home, the difference is enormous.

According to the HUD, over 50 percent of those who consulted counselors were able to purchase their homes within 12 months. Without the help of a counselor, that period probably becomes much longer.
<h4>When You’re Looking to Rent</h4>
Although it may not be as complicated as buying a home, the rental process can still feel overwhelming. Consult a HUD-approved housing counselor, and they can help you find the perfect rental by:
<ul>
 	<li>Determining which type of rental best fits your needs.</li>
 	<li>Finding a rental in your location.</li>
 	<li>Weighing your needs versus your desires.</li>
 	<li>Seeing how long your lease should be.</li>
</ul>

In terms of your finances, a housing counselor can offer rental assistance by:
<ul>
 	<li>Determining how much rent fits your budget while taking utilities and other monthly expenses into account.</li>
 	<li>Seeing how much you’ll need to save for application fees, moving expenses, and other upfront costs.</li>
 	<li>Matching your credit history with available, realistic options.</li>
 	<li>Developing a monthly budget that works for you.</li>
</ul>
Lastly, a housing counselor can lead the way when it comes to your rent lease by:
<ul>
 	<li>Informing you of your rights and responsibilities, as well as the landlord’s.</li>
 	<li>Explaining the lease and other related documents.</li>
 	<li>Telling you what to do if you feel you experienced discrimination during the rental process.</li>
 	<li>Educating you on your security deposit.</li>
 	<li>Helping you inspect your new rental before you move in.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Beyond offering such guidance, a HUD-approved housing counselor may also be able to help you get rental assistance via the Section 8 program. If approved, you could receive a Housing Choice Voucher to help you pay your rent.

Now that you see how a government-approved housing counselor can help you, whether you’re buying or renting, call (800) 569-4287 to find one in your area or click here.

You may be able to get a counselor’s help for free.

<h4>3. Local News</h4>
Your local news program may broadcast when new food distribution sites are announced. An even better way to find this information is through your news channel’s Facebook page or website. Check your local newspaper as well, as it may offer details on where food is being distributed too.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

This is something you may want to do daily until your situation gets settled. Demand for food assistance programs is currently through the roof, and opportunities are constantly appearing.

3269,"How To Keep Utility Companies From Shutting Off Your Services","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Are you receiving utility shutoff notices in your mailbox? Instead of tossing them in the trash, you’ll need to address the situation to keep the lights on, the water running, and the gas flowing.

This can be tough to do if you are on a limited income or have little cash flowing in. There are ways to work with utility companies, however, to buy you some time and make your bills more manageable. Let’s jump into them now.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>True or False? Utility Companies Can Shut off Services</h4>
Before we jump into tips to keep your utilities from being suspended, let’s talk about a widespread misconception that surrounds the topic.

It’s a myth that a utility company cannot turn off your services for a failure to pay. As long as they warn you ahead of time, they can shut off your water, gas, electricity, etc. They can also make moves to ensure they don’t lose money in the future as well.

How can they protect themselves from financial loss with you as a customer? By charging you a deposit to get your services turned back on. They can then use this deposit, if needed, to pay a bill if you fail to do so.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>State Laws That Protect Consumers Against Shutoffs</h4>
While utility companies as a whole can shut off services, some states have laws to protect consumers to keep it from happening. For instance, some states prevent disconnections when the winter rolls around and certain low temperatures are reached.

Others, by law, postpone disconnection if the customer sets up a payment plan. Lastly, some states outlaw the suspension of services if there is a household member who is dependent on a system for life support, disabled, elderly, or seriously ill.

To see your state’s laws on utility disconnections, consult the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which can also offer assistance with your cooling and heating costs. You can see if you qualify for a LIHEAP grant by going here.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Setting up a Payment Plan With Your Utility Company</h4>
If you can’t pay your bills now, your utility company will expect you to at some point. To achieve this goal, they may let you catch up on your bills by negotiating a payment plan.

Such plans often come in two forms. The first adds part of your past due amount to future monthly bills. The second divides your annual utility expenses by 12.

How does this help you? By avoiding the costly surprise that comes with months carrying high cooling and heating costs, which usually happens in the summer or winter. If your monthly payments are equal, you’ll be able to handle your bills better and budget accordingly.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Where to Look for Utility Assistance</h4>
If you do not qualify for LIHEAP, there are other ways to find help. 211 can point you in the right direction. Dial it on your phone to speak to a local operator that may know services in your area which offer utility assistance.

You can also search online for utility assistance via local charities and churches.","When money’s tight, the last thing you need to happen is to have your lights or water shut off due to non-payment.

3271,"Section 8 Scams and How to Avoid Them","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Keep reading to see how to keep your money and information secure when seeking a housing voucher.

While the Internet is certainly convenient, it’s also filled with con artists looking to score easy money at your expense.

What do they often target? People in need who may feel a bit rushed or desperate for a service, which may describe you if you are frantically seeking ways to keep a roof over your family’s head.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

The U.S. Department of Housing And Urban Development (HUD) created its Housing Choice Voucher program (previously Section 8) to give low-income families a boost with the rent. And while you can kickstart the Section 8 application process online, there are certain things you should be aware of to protect yourself from common scams.

Let’s clear the air on what is okay and what’s not acceptable when it comes to Section 8, especially in terms of payments for services that should be free.
<h4>1. Is there a cost to apply for Section 8?</h4>
No. In fact, the HUD prohibits the charging of any fees during the application process.

This makes perfect sense since the program is meant to help families trying to keep their heads above water, so you shouldn’t have to pay a penny to apply.

Whenever you get led to a payment screen when seeking Section 8 information, leave immediately. You should never have to pay for information or an application.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Can you apply for a Section 8 housing voucher online?</h4>
In some instances, yes, you can apply online. Your best bet may be to apply in person with your Public Housing Agency (PHA), however, so you can get help with filling out the application and keep your data secure.

Either way, find your local PHA here and contact them to see your options and set up an appointment. Do this first before entering your information into any online application.

Some sites may trick you into thinking you’re applying for Section 8 when you are not. After you enter your data, they’ll sell it to marketing companies who will hound you with other offers.

For this reason alone, it’s best to get to know your PHA now before making any moves that could compromise your information.
<h4>3. Can you pay for someone else’s voucher?</h4>
Never underestimate the creativity of scammers. Some will offer vouchers online in exchange for money.

Why would they do this? Because they know that Section 8 vouchers have notoriously long waiting lists that could last years, even after you’re approved.

If a person is extremely anxious to get their voucher and get off the waiting list, they may be willing to fork over cash for a fake voucher.

You cannot buy someone else’s voucher, so don’t bother. You also cannot pay or bribe anyone to move up on the waiting list.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Do you have to pay to view Section 8 properties?</h4>
Viewing a property should be free, as should getting any pertinent information on it. Be sure to see the landlord in person so you can view the property and get informed.

Never send them payment for services that a legitimate landlord would do at no cost.
<h4>5. Can you pay to reserve a Section 8 property?</h4>
Here’s another common scam that takes advantage of Section 8 “scarcity.” If a landlord asks for payment to reserve their Section 8 rental, do not do it.

You will often see this and similar deposit scams on online classified sites for rentals that do not even exist.","You may feel so stressed in your search for Section 8 rental assistance that you become blind to scammers.","2021-06-01 20:10:14",post,https://goodnesting.com/section-8-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1399145951.jpg,shutterstock_1399145951.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1399145951.jpg,2873,shutterstock_1399145951,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1399145951.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Rental Assistance",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,section-8-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:45:19"
3273,"What Happens After You Apply For Section 8?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Getting rental assistance from the government’s Housing Choice Voucher program can make it much easier to meet your monthly budget.

If you qualify, part of your rent will be paid by a local Public Housing Agency (PHA) directly to the landlord of a Section 8 home.

While it’s not the quickest way to get help with the rent, a housing voucher can be the best way to ensure your family stays off the streets and in safe, affordable housing. In short, it’s a long-term solution for low-income families, which makes applying for Section 8 a worthwhile process.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If there is one drawback to Section 8 housing, it’s the demand for it. Housing vouchers are limited, while the need for them can be quite high, no matter where you live.

What do high voucher demand and low supply equal? A long, sometimes tiring Section 8 application process that doesn’t end once you apply.

While you can contact your local PHA right now to find out how to start the voucher application process, let’s look at the steps that come after you apply.

What to Do Once Your Housing Choice Voucher Application Is Complete
<h4>1. Wait for approval.</h4>
This is the first time you’ll have to wait when applying for Section 8, and it can take weeks or months for your application to be approved. You can accelerate this process by applying online, which often gets processed faster than paper applications.

If a review of your Section 8 application finds that you meet all of the eligibility requirements for a housing voucher, you will have to wait once again, this time on a waiting list.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. See if you made the waiting list.</h4>
While getting a housing voucher to help with the rent is the end goal of applying for Section 8, you’ll find that making the waiting list will be your first goal. Once on the waiting list, you’ll be in line for a housing voucher.

You can find out your waiting list status by either checking online or receiving an official letter in the mail. PHAs vary in how they notify applicants, so be sure to ask what their procedure is.

How do you make the waiting list? That depends on your PHA. Some will determine placement on a first-come, first-served basis. Others, meanwhile, will draw a random lottery to see who the lucky voucher recipients are.

It’s important to know that meeting all of the Section 8 eligibility requirements does not guarantee you’ll make the waiting list. Once again, demand and availability play a significant part here. If you do get rejected, ask your PHA for the reason why.

<h4>3. See how long you’ll have to wait.</h4>
Perhaps the worst part of the entire Section 8 application process is sitting on the waiting list. Some lists can take several years to process, so you may have to be extra patient to get your voucher.

Ask your PHA where you sit on the list or for an estimated waiting time.
<h4>4. Keep checking your status.</h4>
It's crucial to continuously check your waiting list status to see where you stand and if any more information is needed. If you don’t respond when asked to, you could lose your spot.
<h4>5. Attend your in-person interview.</h4>
The final step before getting your housing voucher is to have an interview to see that you still meet all of the eligibility requirements. Keep an eye out for the notice to interview, so you don’t miss it.","Applying for a Section 8 housing voucher can be a lengthy process.

3276,"Should You Air Seal Your Home?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

What’s one of the biggest culprits when it comes to ever-increasing electricity costs? Air that escapes due to leaks in your home. While this is an issue that tends to affect older homes, you may want to look at your current living situation to see if sealing leaks is a project worthy of your time.

<h4>What Is Air Leakage?</h4>
When outside air enters your home and conditioned air leaves it, you have air leakage. What causes this costly occurrence? Cracks and openings in your home, and even the most minuscule ones can lead to major increases in your cooling and heating costs.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Some people see air leakage as a benefit. They use it for ventilation at times, but since it’s not always needed, leakage does more harm than good.

Take the summer, for example. A scorching hot June in south Florida can result in a little wind and loads of warm, muggy air. If that enters your home, it will create an uncomfortable atmosphere.

What will you do to combat it? Turn down your AC more than you usually would, which increases energy usage.

Besides creating discomfort, air leakage can allow harmful moisture in. This can not only affect your family’s health, but it can also affect the structure of your home and its durability over the years.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How to Air Seal Your Home</h4>
A cost-effective way to air seal any home is via caulking and weatherstripping. Both can offer an excellent return on investment within a year by lowering monthly electricity costs.

Caulk is often used for openings linked to non-moving parts of a house, such as around window or door frames. Weatherstripping, meanwhile, is usually reserved for sealing moving parts, such as operable windows or doors themselves.

Here are some tips to ensure your home is sealed correctly and “weatherized” so it stays cool in the summer and warm in the winter:
<ul>
 	<li>Examine all of your doors and windows. Caulk and weatherstrip any that are leaking air.</li>
 	<li>Look for areas where electrical wiring, ducting, or plumbing comes through walls, ceilings, floors, etc. Seal any leaks in these areas where loads of conditioned air can escape.</li>
 	<li>Switchplates and outlets on your walls should have foam gaskets installed behind them to prevent leakage.</li>
 	<li>Significant gaps around baseboards, windows, and other areas should be closed with foam sealant.</li>
 	<li>Use a fire-resistant material like furnace cement caulk to seal leaks near gas-fired water heater vents, furnaces, and fireplace chimneys.</li>
 	<li>If your kitchen exhaust fan is not in use, cover it to prevent air leaks.</li>
 	<li>Are there spots on your carpet or ceiling paint? There may be air leaks on nearby wall/floor joints or interior wall/ceiling joints that need caulking.</li>
 	<li>Mold or dirty spots on your insulation could signify an air leak. Low-expansion spray foam can provide a much-needed seal here before the issue gets out of hand.</li>
 	<li>Have your home tested for airtightness so you can pinpoint where any problems are.</li>
</ul>

3278,"Best Mortgage Programs For Single Parents","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

However, there are programs designed to help single mothers obtain funding to purchase a home.The federal government sponsors several mortgage programs that help low income families purchase homes.

Some are available to specific groups of people such as veterans and their surviving spouses. Others are accessible to anyone who meets the income requirements. In this article, we discuss how single mothers can gain access to a mortgage through these programs.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>FHA Loans</h4>
An FHA loan is a mortgage backed by the U.S. government. These loans are offered by financial institutions which have been approved by the Federal Housing Administration. FHA loans have much lower requirements when compared to standard mortgage loans. For example, people can qualify for an FHA loan with a credit score as low as 500, giving only 10 percent down payment. Families with scores above 580 are given a more generous offer, as they have to put a down payment of only 3.5 percent.

FHA loans are very popular among single mothers because of their lower financial requirements. Raising children is hard, especially when done with a single source of income. As a result, single parents often have lower credit scores which may close the door to standard mortgage loans. FHA loans are an optimal solution that adapts to their lower annual income and payment capacity. Some institutions even provide financial assistance to help single parents cover down payment.

Another attractive feature of FHA loans is their flexible debt-to-income ratio requirements, or DTI. Debt-to-income ratio represents how much income goes into monthly debt payments, including credit card bills, car loans and mortgages. For example, someone earning $30,000 each year, paying $875 a month to debt accounts, will have a 35 percent debt-to-income ratio. Most financial institutions will approve FHA loans to applicants with a debt-to-income ratio as high as 50 percent. To know more about FHA loans, you can check our article on the matter.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>VA Loans</h4>
A VA loan is a mortgage backed by the U.S. Department for Veteran Affairs, or VA. These loans are only available to veterans, military members currently serving, reservists and surviving spouses of deceased veterans. Single mothers are eligible for a VA mortgage loan if their husbands died in the line of duty or as a result of service-related disabilities. However, if their husband was discharged under dishonorable conditions, the surviving spouse will not be eligible for a VA mortgage loan.

VA mortgage loans can be used to purchase single-family homes, multi-unit properties and newly built properties. To get approved for a loan, single mothers will need to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility, which serves as proof of the time their husbands served in the military. This certificate can be obtained through several methods. People can ask their preferred VA approved lenders for the certificate, use the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs' eBenefits website, or mail the local VA office with form 26-1800.

The income requirements to get approved for a VA loan are different than other government-backed mortgages. For example, although VA lenders do not have a set income threshold, single parents must have a stable income source that can cover all monthly expenses, including the VA mortgage. They must also have some excess income to deal with unexpected expenses and emergencies. Lenders usually look for credit scores above 620. However, they have recently started accepting applications from people with credit scores as low as 500. That includes single mothers who have struggled to keep their scores high enough to qualify under normal circumstances.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>USDA Loans</h4>
USDA loans are mortgages backed by the Department of Agriculture, or DA. These loans are available to eligible rural and suburban single mothers who are interested in buying property in the countryside. USDA loans require no down payment and have more affordable mortgage insurance rates than other government-backed loans such as FHA and VA mortgages, at around 0.35% annually. Unlike FHA or VA home loans, USDA loans can be used to repair or upgrade existing homes. However, the maximum borrowing amount for this purpose is $27,500.

USDA mortgages are issued directly by the government through the USDA loan program or by local lenders who have been approved to issue them. However, only single parents who have low or very low income can request a loan directly from the USDA. They enjoy additional financial benefits, such as interest rates as low as 1 percent. Single mothers above the income threshold have go request approval from local lenders, which often have higher interest rates and require credit scores of at least 620.

USDA lenders compensate no down payment with stricter income requirements. First, debt-to-income ratio must be lower than 41 percent unless your credit score is above 680. Single parents must also provide proof that they will have steady income for at least 24 months. People with poor or no credit history can become eligible using alternative credit references such as rental and utility payment histories.

More than a third of children are now being raised by single parents. Offering them more opportunities to have a happy childhood, away from financial difficulty, is among the top priorities of the U.S. government. There programs were designed to help families provide a home to the new generation. And that includes single mothers.","For most single parents, raising their children is a financial challenge. Providing a roof where they can grow is even more difficult with a single income source.","2020-09-01 01:17:28",post,https://goodnesting.com/best-mortgage-programs-for-single-parents/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singlemom010.jpg,singlemom010.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singlemom010.jpg,2886,singlemom010,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singlemom010.jpg,,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,best-mortgage-programs-for-single-parents,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:46:12"
3281,"Guide to Home Energy Assistance For Low Income Families","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

To alleviate these financial concerns, the federal government has established the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to offer subsidies for power bills.

This program was established in 1981 and is handled by the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS), which allocates funding to all fifty states so that they can make this type of financial aid available. In this guide, we offer relevant information on what are the requirements to qualify for LIHEAP, and how to apply.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Benefits of Home Energy Assistance</h4>
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) offers a variety of benefits and services that are slightly different in each state. However, most of the benefits can be grouped into three categories: financial assistance with power bills, emergency relief in crisis situations, and support for families who desire to make their homes more energy efficient.

Financial aid awarded for cooling and heating is determined by gross annual income, number of people in the household, and size of the home. Other factors might include type of fuel or related statistical data. More benefits are allocated to elderly and disabled people.

For example, a family of three from North Dakota in a three bedroom house with annual income of $5,000. The formula used by the state’s Department of Human Services dictates that, if the family reports $1,000 on power bills each year, they would have to cover $200 while the LIHEAP program subsidizes the remaining $800. This means that the family would only have to set aside 4% of their annual income to cover 20% of their power bills.

The subsidy only covers cooling and heating bills. Water and sewer bills are not part of the LIHEAP program. An exception is made for families that rely on water for air conditioning. Some states provide money to cover only a house’s main heating source. A family that relies on gas to heat their home may get support to pay only their gas bill instead of all their power bills.

LIHEAP recipients can use a portion of their awarded funds towards making a home more energy efficient. The government refers to these improvements as “weatherization.” For example, people can fix leaky doors or windows, install insulation, or replace broken air conditioners. The Low Income Weatherization Assistance Program is made available by the Department of Energy to help families weatherize their homes.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How To Qualify</h4>
In order to receive the benefits of the LIHEAP program, a family must provide sufficient proof that they require financial help to cover the basic costs of powering their home. In general, a family of three must have a combined annual income of less than $30,000 to be eligible. However, some states have decided to expand the eligibility criteria to fit families that need help but do not qualify for assistance.

Each state offers a unique set of benefits in its LIHEAP program, with different criteria for each of the individual services. For example, a family may be eligible to receive subsidies for only the heating portion of their power bills. States usually have arrangements in place with local utility companies which allow them to be more flexible when allocating LIHEAP funds. People can visit the local LIHEAP office to know which benefits they qualify for.

In some states, people have the option to automatically qualify for LIHEAP benefits if they participate in other federal assistance programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). They may still be required to fill an application form to gain access to the services. Local LIHEAP offices usually provide information about automatic qualification to residents in the area.

<h4>How To Apply</h4>
Each state manages its own application process. Families who meet their state’s requirements can find more information about the process by visiting the local LIHEAP office. Some states allow citizens to submit an online application. A member of the household will be asked to create an account at the state’s benefits website. Through account access, an applicant can track the assistance they receive. Another benefit of creating an online account, one application can enroll in other government assistance program such as food assistance or Medicaid.

LIHEAP benefits are offered in most states under a first come-first served basis. Each state is given a limited amount of money by the Department of Health and Humans Services (HHS), which means that not all families that qualify for the program will be able to receive the subsidy for their power bills. When there is a shortage of funds legislators can sponsor emergency bills to increase available funds.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

LIHEAP is the government’s largest grant focused on low-income energy affordability. But it continues to be cut, in total by more than 30% since 2009. Trump has threatened to eliminate LIHEAP entirely, along with similar programs like the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program. For now, these programs remain funded but with increasing opposition. Now is the time for anyone who may be eligible to claim the benefits.","Access to electricity, cooling and heating are fundamental rights of any family.

3288,"What Is A Jumbo Mortgage","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

In recent years, housing prices have been rising steadily, increasing the number of applications for jumbo mortgages. Each year, the federal government establishes national lending limits for traditional mortgages. In 2018, these limits are $453,000 in most counties except for a few areas where it can be as much as $675,000. 

Despite the added risk, jumbo loans are very useful when a traditional mortgage does not provide sufficient funds.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Are Jumbo Loans?</h4>
Jumbo loans are mortgages that exceed national mortgage lending limits. These mortgages are not guaranteed by the government, which means lenders are not protected if borrowers default. In general, any loan can gain jumbo status if the total amount borrowed is higher than the annual lending limit.

High lending limits mean jumbo loans are not accessible to low income families. For them, a better alternative would be FHA mortgage loans, which are within the federal lending limits, eligible to be guaranteed by the government, and generally have more relaxed qualifications.

Borrowers who take jumbo loans might lose some tax benefits. For example, most homeowners are able to deduct mortgage interest payments from their taxes. However, this tax deduction only works for loans under $1 million. As loans become larger borrowers may lose access to this and other tax deductions.
<h4>The Difference Between Jumbo and Standard Loans</h4>
The main difference between jumbo loans and standard mortgages is their size. Traditional mortgages go from $25,000 to $453,000 and are guaranteed by the government. Jumbo loans start at $453,000 and have no ceiling on how much can be borrowed.

Another key difference is down payment. Financial institutions often approve government-backed mortgages with little to no down payment. For example, FHA loans require between 3.5 and 10 percent down to get approved. In some cases, borrowers might even get financial assistance to cover down payment. In contrast, lenders require no less than 10 percent down payment for jumbo mortgages.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Jumbo loans are riskier than traditional mortgages, and likely carry higher interest rates as well. On average, financial institutions charge between 0.25 and 1.5 percent extra interest on jumbo loans compared to traditional mortgages.

In 2017, almost 25 percent of all mortgage applications had loan amounts that exceeded national lending limits. The reason is twofold. First, housing prices have been steadily increasing, causing a need for bigger home loans. Second, people often merge their first and second mortgages into a single jumbo loan to lower interest rates.
<h4>How To Qualify For A Jumbo Loan?</h4>
Qualifying for a jumbo loan requires more paperwork than traditional mortgages. For example, most financial institutions will finance home purchases to customers with FICO scores around 600 points. FHA loans bring the number down to around 500. In contrast, jumbo mortgages require a score of 700 or better.

Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is another value financial institutions take into consideration. It represents how much income goes into monthly debt payments, including credit card bills, car loans and mortgages. For example, someone earning $30,000 each year, paying $875 a month to debt accounts, will have a 35 percent debt-to-income ratio.

Although lenders can be flexible with debt-to-income ratio, most deny customers who are above 45 percent. This is because lenders prefer when borrowers do not carry too much debt, as it often negatively impacts their ability to cover monthly payments.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Standard mortgage lenders do not verify if borrowers have cash reserves. In some cases, such as when approving FHA loans, borrowers might receive financial support to cover down payment. However, financial institutions have a different approach with jumbo loans. Borrowers must prove they have enough cash reserves to cover at least twelve monthly payments. That in addition to down payment money.
<h4>Benefits of Jumbo Loans</h4>
The main benefit of a jumbo mortgage is that it allows borrowers to sidestep lending limits. In the past, jumbo mortgages were less common but, rising home prices have made jumbo mortgages a relatively new norm.

Jumbo mortgages are also very useful to homeowners who cannot request a second mortgage without exceeding lending limits. For example, a family might have acquired a property in New York City using a government-backed mortgage loan. However, their property is now valued at a price higher than the local lending limit. Applying for a second mortgage would not take advantage of the property’s entire equity. Refinancing into a larger jumbo mortgage would be a more efficient solution.

Jumbo mortgages also have cash benefits tied to them. Although financial institutions are cautious when issuing jumbo mortgages, most allow down payments of around 10 percent without private mortgage insurance. Wells Fargo is among the best known lenders to follow this practice.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Smaller institutions like U.S. Bank prefer a safer approach though, asking borrowers 20 percent down payment to avoid private mortgage insurance. Borrowers are advised to shop around before submitting an application for financing.

3291,"Buying A Foreclosed Home","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

With more than 60,000 properties nationwide entering foreclosure each month, finding an ideal home is just a matter of looking. In this article, we provide several tips on buying foreclosed properties.
<h4>Buying a foreclosed home requires an understanding of the process, as well as some preparation</h4>
First, a foreclosure is a legal process used by lenders to recover losses after a borrower stops paying. When it comes to mortgage loans, borrowers agree to lose their home if payments are not made. In general, failing to cover payments is referred to as defaulting on a loan.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

After a default, the lending institution gains control of the property and a sale will take place to recover a portion of the loan. Usually, foreclosed properties are offered at a discount to comparable homes, giving prepared buyers an opportunity to purchase homes below market value.

Although, you should be aware these homes often have hidden costs. Remember a foreclosed home is being taken from someone who could not take care of it. Buyers have found that foreclosed homes are often damaged and in need of repairs.

Buyers who decide to purchase a foreclosed home should prepare for a lengthy process. Whereas a traditional home purchase is typically completed within 30 to 45 days. Buying a foreclosed property can take up to three times longer depending on how banks handle the process. Starting with an experienced broker and having a letter of pre-approval in-hand will smooth the process.
<h4>Investors should make it a priority to understand the terminology used in the foreclosure world</h4>
Learning the terminology is an important step when buying foreclosed homes. Any foreclosed homes is known as “distressed properties” by financial institutions and government agencies name.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

There are several type of distressed properties based on factors such as ownership and sale conditions. For example, lenders often allow homeowners to sell a property for less than the amount owed on their mortgage. This process precedes a foreclosure, and is known as a short sale. In such cases, potential homebuyers are unable to ask for price reductions or contingencies. Short sales often happen when homeowners achieve negative equity, which means that they owe more than their home’s appraised value. Short sales can be good deals, but the process has significant setbacks. Most short sales take between 90 and 120 days to complete, as lenders will not approve a deal unless buyers meet all their demands, which often include repairs and closing costs.

Most foreclosures involve lenders taking control of a property. In such cases, foreclosed homes are known as REO, or real-estate owned. REOs comprise the majority of foreclosures, and are usually easier to purchase than short sales or auctions. REO sales often take no more than 90 days to complete, as lenders already have procedures in place. However, REO homes are often sold at prices matching nearby properties. People looking for a cheap home might have better luck with short sales or auctions.

If there is enough demand, lenders might put a house for sale at a public auction hasten the process. Public auctions are held by sheriffs or any local authority and often take place in courthouses, convention centers or at the property itself. Foreclosure auctions are all-cash deals, often paid with a cashier’s check. This can be a roadblock for people relying on financing to complete the purchase. Also, these properties may not be available for viewing or inspection before hand. In some cases, houses are still occupied when the auction takes place.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Some properties are owned by federal agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Internal Revenue System. These houses are known as government-owned properties and require additional paperwork to be purchased. However, buying a government-owned house has additional benefits. For example, buyers might obtain financial assistance to complete the purchase. Other benefits might include relaxed payment schedules and low interest rates.
<h4>Prospective homeowners should seek a letter of pre-approval to determine borrowing limits and narrow the search</h4>
A letter of pre-approval serves two purposes. First, it helps borrowers get the paperwork ready for an eventual mortgage application. Second, pre-approval letters determine borrowing limits, which help narrow the search to only attainable properties.

To prepare a pre-approval, financial institutions will check credit histories, debt, annual income and payment records. If a borrower meets certain requirements, lenders will issue a letter pre-approving them for a mortgage loan. These letters are only valid for a certain amount of time, and do not guarantee that funding will indeed be received.

This is no different when the target property is a foreclosed home. In some cases, getting pre-approved might be more valuable when buying foreclosed properties because pre-approved homebuyers are often given privilege by real estate agents. Getting pre-approved from the property owner is also recommended.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Getting assistance from experienced brokers will smoothen the process of buying a foreclosed home</h4>
Financial institutions often hire a team of real estate agents to handle the sale of foreclosed properties. These professionals are also available to help potential buyers go through the process. However, they will always put the bank’s interests first. For this purpose, it is recommended hiring an experienced broker who is pursuing your interests only.

In general, people should look for professional brokers who are experienced in foreclosures. Although the process might be similar to purchasing a regular home, foreclosures have some procedures that differ. For example, each bank has its own rulebook when dealing with foreclosures.

Hiring an agent who has an existing relationship with the originating bank would help assure the purchase closes smoothly.

Despite the value of buying a foreclosed property. Buyers looking to buy a foreclosed home must understand they are dealing with institutions rather than individuals. This means every step of the process goes through several layers of approval before an agreement is reached. Foreclosures have little room for negotiation, and completing a purchase can take two to three times as much time as a regular purchase. Patience and attention to detail are key to succeed every step of the way.","If you are searching for affordable housing, buying a foreclosed property might be the way to go.","2020-09-01 15:15:54",post,https://goodnesting.com/buying-a-foreclosed-home/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/foreclosed.jpg,foreclosed.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/foreclosed.jpg,2743,foreclosed,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/foreclosed.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,buying-a-foreclosed-home,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:55"
3293,"Adding A Co-Borrower To Your Mortgage","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The process of sharing the financial stress of a mortgage loan with a significant other is called co-borrowing.

A significant number of homeowners acquired their properties with help from a co-borrower. Rising home prices mean families often need more than one income source to qualify for a mortgage loan. In this article, we explain in detail what is a co-borrower, and when does it make sense to add someone to your mortgage application.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is a co-borrower?</h4>
In general, the term co-borrower is used to talk about a person who is on someone else's mortgage. However, financial institutions are more specific when using the term. For lenders, a co-borrower is a person whose income, assets and credit history are considered in the mortgage loan application. Most financial institutions only use the term when applicants are a married couple or partners.

Co-borrowers are equally responsible for mortgage payments and must have ownership of the property. If one co-borrower cannot cover their monthly share of mortgage payments, the other must do so to avoid a default. Sometimes, one co-borrower is not living in the property. In such cases, lenders call them a non-occupant co-borrower.

Relatives or friends can also be added to a mortgage application. In this case, lenders refer to them as co-applicants. The difference is that due to not being married or in a partnership, most financial institutions will analyze each co-applicant's finances separately. As such, lenders will issue separate loan applications for the same mortgage to each co-applicant. Like co-borrowers, co-applicants also appear on the property's title and are responsible for mortgage payments.

Borrowers can also add to their mortgage application people who will not appear on the property's title. They can be friends, relatives or parents helping their children complete their first home purchase. Lenders use the term co-signer when referring to them.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Co-signers are responsible for mortgage payments, and their finances are often considered for the loan application. Co-signing is used by families to help kick start the financial history of their children. A similar strategy is to become a guarantor, who is only responsible for the loan when borrowers cannot cover monthly payments.

Having a co-borrower is not required to get approved for a mortgage. However, people often rely on their relatives to improve their financial position and qualify for bigger loans. Although adding a co-borrower can be beneficial, there are some cases in which it might not make sense to do so.
<h4>When to add a co-borrower to your mortgage</h4>
The main benefit of adding a co-borrower to a mortgage is it can bring additional income and assets for a loan application. In general, lenders approve larger loan amounts to applicants with co-borrowers, as it reduces risk of default. Sometimes, adding a co-borrower helps applicants avoid financial barriers they could otherwise face on their own.

An important metric lenders consider before approving a mortgage loan is debt-to-income ratio or DTI. This number represents how much income goes into monthly debt payments, including credit card bills, car loans, and existing mortgages. For example, someone who makes $40,000 annually, paying $1,200 a month to debt accounts, will have a 36 percent debt-to-income ratio. Having a debt-to-income ratio above 50 percent is among the top reasons why mortgage lenders deny an application.

Borrowers with debt-to-income ratio above 50 percent can avoid being rejected by adding a co-borrower to their mortgage application. However, this strategy only works if the combined debt-to-income ratio of all co-borrowers falls below 50 percent. Using the example above, someone with 36 percent DTI would be a good candidate to help a relative, earning $30,000 each year and paying $1,300 a month to debt accounts, get approved for a mortgage loan. Their individual debt-to-income ratio is 36 and 52 percent. However, when combined, their DTI averages 42 percent.

There are situations in which it makes no financial sense to put someone, spouse or relative, on a mortgage application. If it's only a matter of ownership, borrowers can always add their spouses or partners to the property's title without making them co-borrowers. It may be because they already have enough accumulated debt or prefer not becoming responsible for monthly payments. The same principle can be followed by parents who want to share ownership with their children.

Debt-to-income ratio is not the only thing affected by adding a co-borrower to a mortgage. Financial institutions also take a look at other financial data before choosing whether to approve or reject an application. As a result, borrowers should make some extra considerations before going forward with a co-borrower.
<h4>What should be taken into consideration when bringing a co-borrower to the table</h4>
There are several things applicants should consider before adding a co-borrower to their mortgage. First, lenders will determine qualification according to the credit scores of each co-borrower. To qualify for a mortgage, all co-borrowers must have a credit score within lender requirements. In general, lenders require a credit score of at least 600 points for traditional mortgages. FHA mortgages, which are government-backed loans with flexible requirements, are available to people with scores as low as 500.

Credit scores will also determine the interest rates attached to a mortgage loan application. Lenders often use the lower credit score to calculate interest rates and payment schedules. Unless additional income is required to qualify for a mortgage loan, borrowers should only add co-borrowers whose credit score is at or above theirs. Otherwise, it might be better not adding them to a mortgage application.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Adding a co-borrower is also useful when the primary borrower has little or no credit history. Children who are purchasing a home for the first time often use this approach to take advantage of their parents' extensive credit history.

Adding someone to your mortgage application is a decision with significant consequences. Co-borrowing means accepting several risks, including default and loss of credit score. However, being a co-borrower is not permanent. Homeowners can always refinance their properties, replacing or removing those who no longer want to be on the mortgage.","Purchasing a home is often a family business.

3295,"How Much Down Payment is Enough When Purchasing A Home","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The amount of down payment required depends on which type of mortgage you choose. Most lenders require between 10 and 20 percent of the home's value up front to approve a home loan.

Down payment represents the initial equity, or ownership stake, in the property. If a family provides $20,000 to purchase a $200,000 home, then their initial equity will be 10 percent. This equity will grow with each mortgage payment.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you are unable to save for down payment, or prefer to put less money up front, there are alternatives. For example, the federal government sponsors a variety of mortgage programs which accept lower down payments. In this article we provide guidance to help determine how much down payment to make.
<h4>What are the benefits of down payment?</h4>
Not all mortgage loans require 20 percent down payment. There are alternatives for families who don't have enough money saved or prefer to start with less equity. Each of these alternatives comes with their own benefits and drawbacks.

The first option is FHA loans, which are mortgages backed by the U.S. government. These loans are offered by financial institutions which have been approved by the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA. These loans are quite popular among first-time home buyers because of lower requirements. People can qualify for an FHA loan with credit scores as low as 500, giving only 10 percent down payment.

If their scores are above 580, down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent instead. This means someone can purchase a $100,000 home with only $3,500 in hand. Although lenders have to finance the remaining 90 to 96.5 percent, FHA loans have low single-digit interest rates because of government backing. However, in recent years, lenders have been issuing hybrid FHA loans, which start with a fixed-rate and after a few years switch to adjustable rates.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises which help maintain stability in the mortgage market, also offer home loans requiring as little as 3 percent down payment. Several big and small lenders have also started offering low down payment mortgages to stimulate borrowing. In recent years, homebuyers with good enough credit scores have been approved for home loans with less than 3% down payment.

People who currently serve, or have previously served in any branch of the military, have access to special VA loans offered by the Department of Veteran Affairs. These loans have very generous interest rates, flexible requirements and low down payment. Surviving wives of deceased veterans also have access to these loans under special conditions. Families living in rural areas can take advantage of home loans offered by the Department of Agriculture through its Rural Development program. These loans can be used to purchase homes in rural areas. Like VA loans, USDA mortgages have flexible requirements, which can include no down payment.
<h4>How to determine how much to set as down payment?</h4>
With so many options, families often ask themselves which one is better for them. Putting down 20 percent seems attractive due to lower interest rates and monthly payments. However, putting down 3 percent instead may allow a family to purchase a home right away instead of spending several more years saving for a higher down payment.

Choosing the right option requires careful consideration of several factors involving the purchase.

The first one is property value. If the target home is valued at $75,000, it may be easier to put down between $7,500 and $15,000 as down payment. However, properties with higher market values may make this task more difficult. For example, a family would have to save $40,000 to cover 20 percent down payment for a $200,000 home. In such a case, putting down 3 or 6 percent, which is between $6,000 and $12,000, might be a more realistic approach. As explained above, some government agencies approve home loans with no down payment. However, these are often given to low-income families who want to purchase home in places where houses are not expensive.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

The second factor is debt-to-income ratio, which is a number that represents how much of a family's income goes toward paying existing debt accounts. Purchasing a new home means acquiring more debt, which raises debt-to-income ratio. For example, a family earning $2,500 a month, paying $850 monthly to existing debt accounts, has a debt-to-income ratio of 34 percent. Purchasing a $75,000 house through a 30-year fixed interest rate mortgage loan would add around $350 to their monthly debt accounts, raising debt-to-income ratio to 48 percent. In general, lenders approve new loans to families whose debt-to-income ratio is below 43 percent.

Choosing a cheaper home or providing a larger down payment are two ways to keep debt-to-income ratio in check. However, a family that expects some debt accounts to be fully paid in the near future can choose to provide a lower down payment.

The third factor is risk and mortgage insurance. For most lenders, borrowers who provide low down payments are riskier than those that cover 10 or 20 percent of the home's value. More risk means higher interest rates and additional measures taken by lenders to reduce losses. One such measure is mortgage insurance, which is paid for by borrowers and provides a guarantee against losses if a foreclosure takes place. Mortgage insurance is split in two charges, one upfront fee that must be paid when the home loan is approved, and an ongoing charge added to monthly mortgage payments.

Mortgage insurance rates range from 0.3 to 1.5 percent of the principal balance per year. Purchasing the $75,000 home in the example above, with a 0.5 percent mortgage insurance, would raise monthly payments from $350 to $400, adding up to more than $2,100 in total. Some mortgage lenders replace insurance with an upfront guarantee fee, or funding fee, that serves the same purpose. Lower down payment means higher fees.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Purchasing a home is one of the most important financial decisions a family can make. Choosing the right down payment amount is critical to make sure monthly payments do not become a burden, lowering risk of foreclosure. However, providing too much down payment may also bring financial uncertainty if doing so means running out of savings.

The down payment is not the only upfront cost to consider when purchasing a home. Each lender manages its own set of additional fees and closing costs, which can often add up to several thousand dollars. It is recommended to shop around for the most affordable offering before settling down with a lender. After all, some other factors such as interest rates, mortgage insurance, monthly payments and refinancing terms have a much bigger impact over the long term than down payment.","Saving enough money for down payment is among the first items on the list when purchasing a new home.","2020-09-01 15:34:51",post,https://goodnesting.com/how-much-down-payment-is-enough-when-purchasing-a-home/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeForSale_01.jpg,homeForSale_01.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeForSale_01.jpg,2777,homeForSale_01,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeForSale_01.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,how-much-down-payment-is-enough-when-purchasing-a-home,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:55"
3297,"The Basics About Home Construction Loans","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Families who own land or live in areas without houses for sale can instead choose to build their own homes. However, they may need a loan to complete the expensive and complicated home-building process.

Most financial institutions offer home construction loans to help families build a house that meets their needs. There are several types of loans, some of which can be turned into mortgages and paid in 15 or 30 years. However, requesting a home construction loan may require more paperwork than a traditional mortgage. In this article, we explain how they work.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What are home construction loans?</h4>
Families who prefer to build a house rather than purchase an existing one can request a home construction loan from a financial institution. These loans help them cover the construction costs of a new property. Home construction loans exist because mortgages are only granted to purchase an existing structure.

Unlike mortgage loans, where the entire sum is given in advance to purchase a property, home construction loans assign money in stages using a line of credit as borrowers complete project milestones. Home construction loans usually have periods of up to twelve months and have adjustable interest rates higher than mortgage loans.

In general, most home construction loans have interest rates around 2 percent higher than the prime rate given to customers with excellent credit scores. If the prime rate is 4 percent, borrowers will pay up to 6 percent on their home construction loans. However, borrowers only pay interest on borrowed money rather than the entire amount approved as line of credit. Once the house is built, a home construction loan can turn into a mortgage when owners move in.

To get approved for a home construction loan, borrowers must provide a detailed home building project with a realistic budget and timetable. Some banks only approve applications if borrowers use an accredited builder to build the house. Financial institutions also sometimes require justification as to why building a new home is better than purchasing an existing one. Some families request home construction loans to build a house inside land they own. Others do so because there are no suitable houses for sale in the area.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Borrowers who have their home construction loan requests approved will receive funds according to the timetable presented during the application process. Lenders usually send a representative to check construction progress before approving more money. If construction is going as expected, lenders approve money to cover the following stage. Otherwise, borrowers may face penalties such as delay fees.

One important detail about home construction loans is that borrowers can request money to purchase land where the house will be built if they do not own it. In such cases, the first lump sum of money provided by lenders is used to purchase the land, prepare it and begin construction. However, families who include land purchase in their loan applications must often provide a higher sum of money as down payment.
<h4>Construction-to-permanent loans</h4>
There are two main types of home construction loans. The first type is called construction-to-permanent loan and works as an unsecured personal loan until the house is built. Once owners move in, a construction-to-permanent loan becomes a mortgage. The main benefit of a construction-to-permanent loan is that families only have to cover closing costs once. This often means saving thousands of dollars that would otherwise be spent in duplicated fees.

Construction-to-permanent loans have two stages. The first stage is active while the property is being built. During this period, monthly payments only cover interest on outstanding balance. This means families can save money while construction takes place.

For example, a financial institution approves a $100,000 construction-to-permanent loan to build a house. To complete the first construction stage, only $20,000 are needed. The bank then transfers that much money to borrowers. During this stage, borrowers will only pay interest on the $20,000 they have borrowed so far, without paying back the principal. If the interest rate is 6.5 percent, monthly interest payments during the first stages would equal around $120. During later stages, when the entire loan amount has been borrowed, monthly interest payments rise to around $350.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

The second stage of a construction-to-permanent loan begins once the property has been built. When that happens, the loan becomes a 15 or 30-year mortgage with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. From that moment, the loan behaves like a traditional mortgage, with monthly payments covering both interest and principal. Using the example above, monthly payments would jump from $350 to around $500 for the rest of the mortgage loan term. The newly-built home is used as collateral for the mortgage, and a down payment must be provided. In most cases, financial institutions ask borrowers to provide down payment before construction begins.
<h4>Construction-only loans</h4>
The second type is called construction-only loan. This type of home construction loan does not become a mortgage once the house is complete and must be paid back in full before people can move in. Construction-only loans are a good choice for families who have significant cash reserves. They are also the optimal choice for homeowners who plan to repay borrowed money by selling their current homes.

Construction-only loans do not require as large a down payment as their construction-to-permanent equivalents. However, lenders have more strict requirements to make sure borrowers repay back their loans, reducing risk of default. In some cases, people may take out a mortgage to repay their home construction loans. As the house is already built, mortgage lenders can issue home loans to simulate a purchase. Families who own a house can use this method to keep cash in hand once their previous property sells.

The main benefit of construction-only loans is their low down payment and additional flexibility. As the house gets built, families can shop for a mortgage loan with generous interest rates and repayment terms. In most cases, construction-to-permanent loans have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages of the same size. As a result, families may end up paying more money down the road by requesting one.

However, construction-only loans have some important disadvantages. First, they often come with higher interest rates than construction-to-permanent loans. Second, borrowers will pay closing costs twice if they decide to get approved for a mortgage. Also, if a family faces financial difficulties and fails to qualify for a mortgage, they risk losing the newly-built house and having their credit scores fall considerably.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>How to get a home construction loan</h4>
Getting approved for a home construction loan is usually more difficult than requesting a mortgage, especially when it comes to down payment. This is because lenders have no collateral to protect themselves from risk if borrowers default before the house has been constructed. To offset additional risk, most home construction lenders ask for credit scores above 650, no recent history of late payments, stable income source, low debt-to-income ratio and at least 20 percent down payment.

As explained above, lenders also ask for detailed information about the project, including justification as to why buying an existing house is not possible. Also, most lenders only approve home construction loans if an accredited builder is involved in the project. Some banks prefer borrowers who have enough cash reserves to handle any unexpected expenses not accounted for in their proposals.

Finding a home construction loan lender can be challenging. Most financial institutions prefer focusing their businesses on mortgages. Others focus instead on an alternative called “end loan,” in which builders assume construction costs. Once the house is completed, people purchase the house from builders using a traditional mortgage. As most builders are accredited companies, lenders often feel more comfortable issuing end loans.","Purchasing a house is not the only way to become a homeowner.","2020-09-01 15:39:16",post,https://goodnesting.com/the-basics-about-home-construction-loans/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeConstructionLoan01.jpg,homeConstructionLoan01.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeConstructionLoan01.jpg,2775,homeConstructionLoan01,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeConstructionLoan01.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,the-basics-about-home-construction-loans,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-25 21:19:47"
3299,"What Happens When You Default On A Loan","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

This trend has pushed a significant number of families into defaulting on their loans, which can cause them to lose homes and valuable assets. But what does it mean to default on a loan?

Although defaulting generally means failing to cover debt payments, not all financial institutions handle this process the same way. Despite it being a common occurrence, a large number of people don’t know what happens when they default on a loan. In this article, we explore the consequences of defaulting on a loan, and what can be done during the aftermath.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">There are several consequences when defaulting on a loan, including reduced credit score and restricted access to financing</h4>
When someone defaults on a loan, it means they are no longer able to cover monthly payments. There are two ways to default on a loan. The first is to inform the financial institution that payments will no longer be made. The second is to stop paying without informing lenders.

In general, each financial institution has its own guidelines when it comes to declare a loan in default. Some will contact borrowers after the first missed payment while others wait months before reaching out to them. However, as time passes, lenders will rely on more aggressive tactics to contact borrowers who have missed payments.

Defaulting on a loan has several financial consequences. Financial institutions will contact credit bureaus to report borrowers who have missed payments, causing their credit scores to drop. Most lenders contact bureaus 30 days after the first missed payment, though some give a longer grace period to customers with a clean financial record. Lenders can also take possession of assets when someone defaults. We explain more in the following section.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Lenders can take possession of assets to cover losses when someone defaults on a loan</h4>
What happens when someone defaults depends on whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Secured loans require a collateral to be placed in order to get approved. If the borrower defaults, banks keep the collateral. Car loans, mortgages and secured credit cards are some examples of secured loans. If someone defaults on a loan given to purchase a vehicle, lenders can repossess the car and auction it to recoup borrowed money. The same happens with mortgage loans. If a homeowner defaults on a mortgage, lenders can <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/buying-a-foreclosed-home/"">declare foreclosure and sell the property to recover their losses</a>. If the loan <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/adding-a-co-borrower-to-your-mortgage/"">has a co-borrower</a>, then they become responsible for payments if the main borrower is unable to do so.

Secured credit cards and small business loans are popular alternatives that required putting up collateral to get approved. If someone defaults on debt from any of those products, lenders seize any collateral and report the incident to credit bureaus, causing a loss of credit score.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Unsecured loans are different, given that borrowers do not put any collateral to receive funding. In such cases, borrowers who are behind on monthly payments may be charged additional fees or face higher interest rates. If banks conclude that borrowers will no longer pay, they can turn the loan over to a collection agency. These agencies are tasked with doing what’s necessary to make borrowers pay. If they fail, the issue can be taken to court, where a judge can order measures like garnishing salaries.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">What happens when small business owners default on a SBA loan?</h4>
The Small Business Administration (SBA) operates a program where they provide a partial guarantee for loans given to small businesses. In these loans, the SBA acts as a co-signer, increasing lender confidence that at least part of their money is protected against default. SBA loans are not offered by the government agency itself. Instead, they are given by authorized financial institutions that have agreed to meet guidelines set by the SBA.

Small business owners are generally asked to offer up collateral before being approved for an SBA loan. However, sometimes the collateral value may be inferior than what is actually owed. If the small business owner defaults, the Small Business Administration will award lenders a portion of the loan amount, while the rest is usually covered by any existing collateral. Some state laws allow lenders to garnish wages, bank accounts and other properties if needed.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">What are the consequences of defaulting on a Merchant Cash Advance or Peer to Peer loan?</h4>
People who use Merchant Cash Advance to obtain financing agree to sell lenders a portion of their future revenue. In many cases, lenders are willing to renegotiate terms if it means guaranteeing payments. The advantage of these loans is that they only need to be paid as long as there is revenue. Business owners who close their companies are not legally forced to continue paying because there is no more future revenue.

Peer-to-peer loans were introduced to the market in 2006 with the launch of Prosper and Lending Club, two online lending platforms that quickly gained widespread popularity. Currently, peer-to-peer loans represent a $2 billion industry, with more than 200,000 people benefitting from them. One key aspect of peer-to-peer lending is the fact that borrowers are not legally responsible for any losses if they default. Investors lending money through peer-to-peer platforms such as Lending Club have to take that into account. As a result, most loans offered through this medium have high interest rates.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Is bankruptcy the same as defaulting on a loan?</h4>
Some people believe that declaring bankruptcy is the same as defaulting on debt obligations. However, there are some significant differences between the two processes. For once, declaring bankruptcy is a serious step taken to inform creditors that a borrower will not pay back any debt. Bankruptcy stops all collection efforts, telephone calls, garnishment of wages, lawsuits and more. In many cases, declaring bankruptcy also gets rid of many debt types, such as credit cards, medical bills, unsecured loans and more. However, some debt cannot be removed through bankruptcy, such as student loans, tax obligations and child support.

A significant number of families believe that declaring bankruptcy will stop lenders from seizing their homes and vehicles. However, financial institutions can still take possession of any assets and properties offered as collateral, even if borrowers declare bankruptcy. Additionally, defaulting on a loan has a moderate impact on someone’s credit score. If default is temporary, recovering would only take several months of on-time payments.

In contrast, bankruptcy has severe financial consequences. People who have declared bankruptcy are usually denied access to financing, mortgage and auto loans for several years. In some cases, they see their access to the banking system revoked or restricted. Rebuilding financial history after a bankruptcy takes years, and may require the use of credit-building tools such as secured credit cards.

However, although most people understand what defaulting means, only a few are prepared to recover from a mortgage loan default. In fact, many homeowners believe that defaulting on their mortgage means immediate foreclosure.

Recovering from a mortgage loan default takes knowledge of how the process works and what your options are. This includes understanding how lenders manage late payments and when does a mortgage default translates into a foreclosure. In this article, we offer some suggestions to help homeowners recover from a mortgage loan default.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What does defaulting a mortgage mean and what are its consequences?</h4>

One of the most common consequences is the hiking of interest rates. Some lenders may require the defaulter to begin a new repayment scheme that is associated with a much higher interest rate. This sudden increase in monthly payments can put the economic capacity of a family at risk, possibly pushing them into financial hardship.

Another negative outcome of defaulting on a mortgage loan is foreclosure. This is perhaps much worse than having to make repayments at much higher interest rates. It involves the sale of the property and the subsequent transfer of ownership. The lender may choose to keep the property for future use or may simply sell it off to recover all or some of their money.

There are steps that a borrower can take to deal with defaulting on a mortgage loan. Not all hope is lost when someone defaults. The major steps that a borrower can take are given below.

<h4>Negotiating with the lender</h4>

Mortgage penalties are not always slapped immediately after a default. Actually, the cases in which consequences follow the missing of a payment date are quite rare. Rather, most lenders give as much as 10 days before summoning the borrower and an additional 90 days before a default notice is issued. Depending on their current financial situation, borrowers may use this period to find money and make a monthly payment.

If this time frame is still not sufficient, borrowers may enter into a new deal with the lending institution. Such deals are usually meant to allow borrowers to find extra means of paying for the mortgage and often involve providing an extension to the existing repayment period. This offers the borrower a chance to get back on track. How long the recovery period lasts depends on the lender. Some financial institutions give borrowers between three and five months, while others might wait up to a year.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Most lenders will require borrowers to offer a guarantee that, once the grace period ends, payments will resume with no issues. Lenders will not approve negotiation requests unless they are convinced that the borrower will be able to start making payments after a few months. In some cases, borrowers will have to make larger payments once the grace period is over to make up for the time they were not asked to pay.

<h4>Applying for the modification of  loan terms and conditions</h4>

Apart from striking a deal that grants the borrower a grace period, it is also possible to apply for the complete alteration of the terms and conditions of the mortgage loan. Federal law allows borrowers to have their loan terms altered provided certain conditions have been met. For example, the Home Affordable Modification Program that has been put in place to help individuals who are struggling to make timely mortgage repayments.

There are various changes that can be made to a loan as determined the coordinator of the program, including extending the length of the loan, reducing  interest rates by a certain amount, and lowering the principal. The goal is to make sure that the person is able to make payments without struggling too much. Not all borrowers may apply for the loan modification program. Rather, only those who have met certain eligibility requirements may be allowed. In order to seek the involvement of the program, the borrower must have faced a well documented financial hurdle that can be backed by the lender. This is in addition to having a reliable source of income.

<h4>Exploring Keep your Home Programs available in various states</h4>

Some states have programs that were put in place to help individuals who are struggling to make monthly payments. These differ from the modification programs because they provide financial assistance to borrowers without renegotiating the mortgage. Several states operate various programs that offer financial help to mortgage defaulters and those who are on the brink of defaulting.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Depending on the state, as much as $25,000 may be provided. For example, unemployed homeowners in the state of California are entitled to $3,000 as monthly redemption allowance to help them avoid defaulting. This value may be higher or lower depending on the financial state of the borrower and how much money is available through the program. Such programs are available to homeowners who have defaulted and those who have not yet defaulted but have been subjected to penalty fees such as late payment charges.

<h4>Hiring a foreclosure counsellor</h4>

In cases where a foreclosure appears to be imminent, there may be a need to hire a foreclosure counsellor. Such a step is necessary if the chances of losing the home are quite high and especially if a foreclosure notice has already been issued. Such counsellors are equipped with the necessary skills and information to enable a borrower to successfully avoid the sale of the house. In this way, it is possible to increase the chances of keeping of a home without having to spend too much extra money.

<h4>Finding the home's equity value</h4>

The equity value of a home may be a means of survival in the worst case scenario. In mortgage loan terms, equity is simply the amount of money that a house is worth after considering the value of the debt. It is the difference between the current market value of the home and the total amount owed. This value can be positive or negative depending on the market value of the house. When it is negative, the house is worth less than the value of the mortgage. The converse is true in cases where it is positive.

To get the correct market value of the home, it is advisable to get in touch with a professional property evaluator. Such individuals are able to check the market information coupled with assessment tools to determine the actual cost of the house. Hiring a property evaluator can cost between $300 and $1,000, depending on location. If the home has a positive equity, selling it can be one of the options to settle the mortgage loan. This process is often called a short sale and homeowners must receive permission from lenders before they can sell the property.

<h4>Additional information for mortgage defaulters</h4>
In addition to the steps above, there is specific information that borrowers must bear in mind. First of all, state laws on mortgages may vary. A borrower must be fully aware of local laws and regulations to avoid being caught by surprise.

For example, the Truth in Lending Act says that lenders must clearly state how much is the annual mortgage interest rate. If a borrower has defaulted, one may use such information to make financial decisions. Further, closing cost fees must not exceed 3 percent of the total loan value as stipulated by the Anti-Predatory Lending Act. Other laws may impose further restrictions on how lenders can answer to a potential default.","As the number of families facing potential financial hardship grows, so does the risk that they default on their mortgage loan.","2020-09-01 16:06:02",post,https://goodnesting.com/life-after-paying-no-bills-for-a-year/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_90864914.jpg,shutterstock_90864914.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_90864914.jpg,2819,shutterstock_90864914,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_90864914.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,life-after-paying-no-bills-for-a-year,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:54"
3303,"After This, For Sure an Air Conditioner will Fail","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Like any other valuable home appliance, air conditioners require periodic maintenance and care to work efficiently. However, a significant number of households don’t know much about how they operate.

Families should be aware of common practices to keep their air conditioner units running at maximum efficiency. In this article, we talk about eight things people need to know about air conditioning. These suggestions will help homeowners extend the life of their air conditioning devices while saving money on utility bills.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Changing Filters</h4>
Clean filters make air conditioners work more efficiently. Removing dirty filters is a task that must be performed periodically to maintain the air conditioner in good shape. Some filters can be washed and reused several times before being replaced. During the cooling season, replacing the filter once a month is good practice. Some families may consider a longer period to reduce the economic cost.

Filters come in different types. They are categorized according to the MERV or minimum efficiency reporting value. This number, which goes from 1 to 12 for filters designed to be used in home units, determines the quality of the filter. High-numbered filters provide better filtration, but at the expense of increased energy consumption. Choose the filter that provides a better balance between quality and energy costs.
<h4>Fixing Leaks</h4>
Leaks are a common problem in most home air conditioner installations. They can be the cause of up to 30% lost airflow when not properly addressed. Though most window AC units are known for their proficiency to leak, there are several workarounds households can use. To find leaks, most families rely on the “smoke trick,” which consists of lightening up incense and holding it where the window frame makes contact with the AC unit. They can also check for leaks at the central AC by holding the stick close to duct connections. In either case, if smoke is blown away, there is a leak.

Simple leaks can be fixed without much trouble. Small leaks can be patched with foil tape, whereas larger ones are easily closed with duct mastic. Families who have a window AC unit, stuffing foam between the unit and the window frame is a good solution, though some taping might be required to keep it in position. If the leak is more severe, call for service. Households who have contracted a home warranty can ask their providers to cover the cost of a potential repair bill.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Using Timers</h4>
New air conditioners come with thermostats which can be programmed to improve energy efficiency. There is no need to keep the AC unit working at full capacity if the house is empty. Using a timer, people can program air conditioners to work at higher temperatures when they are away, reducing monthly energy costs. Older AC units may not have this feature. However, timers are available at home stores for $10 to $20.

If a timer has to be purchased, homeowners should make sure its voltage matches that of the air conditioner. Otherwise, it may not work as intended. To further save on energy costs, it is recommended to keep the air conditioner system powered on at all times. Shutting it off will increase energy usage as they will have to work harder to achieve desired temperatures. However, when going on vacation, the device must be shut down to save money.
<h4>Wrapping Ducts</h4>
Air conditioners need cooled ducts to work properly. However, some places like hot attics or small spaces may make this task quite difficult. To address this problem, households can use spray foam, batt or rigid-foam insulation to cover the ducts and keep them cooled. They should always remember to use foil tape instead of regular duct tape. In some circumstances, using foam or insulation is not a possibility. In such tight spaces, wraps like Reflectix might provide better protection against heat.
<h4>Servicing the Compressor or Condenser</h4>
The air compressor or condenser of a central air conditioner installation is typically placed outside the house. Most devices are installed near the house’s foundation, with the surrounding area clear of any obstacles impeding airflow. Some families grow bushes or build decorations around their compressors. Those who do must make sure to keep a distance of no less than 24 inches between the device and nearby objects.

Most companies recommend that compressors and condensers be installed on the north or east side of the house. This way, the machine is protected from the sun. If needed, grow bushes or trees around it to provide extra protection as long as they are at the required distance. Research has shown that, when exposed to direct sunlight, compressors work with as much as 10% less efficiency.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Maintaining your Air Conditioner</h4>
Cleaning the filters is not the only way to properly maintain an air conditioner. Dealers usually put customers on a yearly cleaning schedule to perform other maintenance tasks that are also needed to keep the unit working at full efficiency. Checkups are often done before the cooling season takes place, though customers can request an early checkup if they consider it necessary.

Some of the tasks technicians perform during a routine checkup include: inspecting and cleaning coils, adjusting or replacing malfunctioning fan belts, lubricating engines and bearings, fixing blowers, checking controls and safety measures, verifying temperatures, replacing refrigerants, and more. Filters are also often cleaned or replaced during a scheduled checkup. If an AC unit is not properly cooling the house, it may be time for a routine checkup.
<h4>Improving Airflow and Cooling</h4>
Households should always try to extend the life of their air conditioners. Protecting interior spaces from direct sunlight can help the AC unit and significantly reduce energy consumption. Running floor or ceiling fans along with the air conditioner can help with air circulation and achieve desire temperatures faster.

Closing too many doors often has a negative effect. They cause central AC units to lose balance, keeping some parts of the house cooler than others. If needed, keep the doors slightly ajar to make sure airflow is not entirely severed. Building alternative airflow routes is also good practice, though it can be expensive. Families who participate in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, may be able to divert part of the funds to better weatherize their house.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Upgrading Your AC</h4>
Air conditioners don’t last forever. After several years, some units may break down beyond repair. Shopping for a good replacement can be overwhelming given the high cost of modern AC units. However, when the time comes to buy a new AC, families must consider the following: the unit’s seasonal energy-efficiency ratio or SEER. Some window units often refer to it as energy-efficiency ratio or EER. This number represents how efficiently the device uses power to cool the house. Federal and state laws require air conditioners to be of at least SEER 13 or EER 8. The higher the number, the cheaper it will be to use it.

A replacement air conditioner might be available for free if the family has an active home warranty contract. However, families must check their plan’s coverage and contact the home services company. Some states allow LIHEAP recipients to partially fund new AC units with their subsidies. If a central unit is too expensive to replace, try purchasing a cheaper window unit.

Air conditioners are costly devices. A central unit can cost as much as $4,000. Many struggling families are unable to replace a broken down AC unit. As a result, it is important to put in practice strategies that extend their lifetime and reduce energy costs.","Most families rely on air conditioners or HVAC systems to maintain comfortable temperatures inside their houses.","2020-09-01 16:21:42",post,https://goodnesting.com/after-this-for-sure-an-air-conditioner-will-fail/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_604122920.jpg,shutterstock_604122920.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_604122920.jpg,2846,shutterstock_604122920,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_604122920.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help",,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,after-this-for-sure-an-air-conditioner-will-fail,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-25 21:19:34"
3305,"Try This For Debt Cancellation, You’ll Like It","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

There is a better way to pay off debt. Reaching out to debt collectors alone is not the way to go, here is the secret recipe that has helped thousands of regular folks settle debt for less than what they owed.

More people are dealing with burdensome debt and it’s not all from discretionary spending. Generally, the cost of living has risen by about 30% in the last ten years, forcing most people to borrow something just to live. But check it out, there are some shortcuts to get debt paid off.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

In this guide, we offer a list of suggestions that, when followed, can greatly reduce the principal balance owed. We include information about easy-to-follow practices designed to reduce spending, avoid common mistakes, and efficiently tackle your debt. Along the way we offer some suggest some sponsored services who specialise in negotiating down debt.

<h4>The Big Picture</h4>
Getting out of debt requires a clear understanding of how much money is being owed. A surprising amount of people ignore how large their debt actually is, believing that paying off their bills is enough to eventually get rid of it. Although it is certainly true that getting out of debt may seem like an impossible feat, many Americans have reduced or eliminated their debt altogether in the past.

Doing so requires discipline, determination, and a comprehensive understanding of the problem’s dimensions. Knowing exactly how much money is owed is a good first step. Financial institutions are willing to provide detailed information about your debt, and from there you can start working towards reducing it. Remember, as high as it may be, your debt will go nowhere else but down if you follow the suggestions in this guide.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Control Your Spending</h4>
Controlling spending, especially spending financed by debt, must be done before getting into the business of paying off existing debt. Your debt will continue to grow if expenditures are higher than monthly payments. A general rule to follow is “if you don’t really need it, don’t buy it.” Unnecessary spending is one of the main causes of excessive credit card debt in the United States, downgrading families’ credit scores as a result.

Some families have a hard time cutting spending due to lack of organization with their finances. To fix this problem, households can track all of their expenses during a month and determine which items should go away. Reducing unnecessary spending is important because it gives people access to additional money that could be put towards paying off debt.

<h4>Create a Budget</h4>
Spending control goes hand in hand with a responsible budget. Families should always have a list of mandatory expenses, including food and utility bills, to understand how much money they have to spend on a monthly basis. A budget will help them identify which expenses are unnecessary as well as the difference between their earnings and expenditures, which is called a deficit. The main purpose of a budget is to quantify the deficit and cut the items that generate it.

Subscriptions and other recurrent expenses may seem insignificant at first. However, when added up, they can represent a large part of a family’s expenses. For example, a $65 monthly Cable TV subscription may not look like a sizable expenditure, yet it becomes a significant money sink when compared with Netflix’s comparable $8 monthly service. A family could save up to $50 if they are eligible to get free phone service from the government through the Lifeline program.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

This is only one example of how creating a budget can help families single out expenditures that could be replaced with cheaper options or removed altogether. It also helps them determine if they need financial assistance. A family with elevated food spending may want to request assistance from the government. 

Almost all states have home energy programs that subsidize heating and cooling for families within the required income levels. Contacting local agencies to find out which programs can help reduce spending is a good next step after a budget has been designed.

<h4>Organize Your Debt</h4>
Organizing all outstanding debt is the next step after you go through the process of creating a budget and cutting unnecessary spending. To do this, you must have all the relevant information, including amounts, interest rates, minimum payments and more. Remember that most financial institutions will provide this information if requested through a call or online banking system, if available.

There are two methods to organize debt. The first one is where all debt is listed from smallest to largest regardless of interest rates. People can build momentum with this method because smaller debt is paid off quickly, consolidating efforts on larger debt like student loans. The downside of this path is inefficient exploitation of low interest rates, which saves the most money over time.

The second method does take into account interest rates. It’s called “laddering” and it works by listing all debts beginning with those with highest interest rates. Due to it focusing on eliminating high interest debt before everything else, laddering is considered to save the most money in the long term. Debt with high interest rates generates larger monthly payments. Working to reduce it first will help you ease the burden on paychecks and improve your credit score at the same time.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Paying Off Your Debt</h4>
Whichever method you choose, the trick is to stick to it. Switching plans along the way will have a negative effect on your finances. If needed, a family could design a hybrid plan to work with, paying off small debt right away. 

Subsequently, they can switch to a laddered approach to tackle high interest rates. Excess cash generated from spending control and budget analysis can be used to speed up the process of paying off debt.

When you’re ready to start paying off your debt, make sure you keep the following suggestions in mind. First, always try to pay more than the minimum payment established by the financial institution. Contrary to popular belief, minimum payments do not contribute towards reducing outstanding debt. 

In many cases, they end up enlarging it instead. Banks and other financial institutions set minimum payments low enough to make sure debt either grows or remains intact over time.

The second recommendation is to throw as much money as possible towards paying off debt. In the previous sections, we offered suggestions to cut spending and responsibly organize a budget. Excess money that will no longer be spent on unnecessary stuff should be used to tackle the debt. You may ask why is this useful, but remember that the more money being put today, the less interest being paid tomorrow.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Try to avoid common mistakes people make on their way out of debt. Among the most common mistakes is closing accounts once the balance has been paid off. Although reducing the number of open accounts seems like a good idea, in reality it tends to have the opposite effect. 

In our guide about how to improve credit scores we talk about the credit utilization ratio, which is obtained by dividing a household’s credit card balance by their total available credit. Paying off debt reduces credit card balance. However, if you close an account, it reduces your total available credit.

It’s no secret that despite the promising economy, many Americans find themselves with more debt each year. The average household in the United States owes at least $130,000 between their mortgage, student or auto loans and credit card debt. That number can be daunting, but with discipline and determination it could go down significantly in a few years.","Imagine looking back 10 years from now and still paying off the same revolving credit lines, having barely made a dent in the balance.","2020-09-01 16:26:50",post,https://goodnesting.com/try-this-for-debt-cancellation-youll-like-it/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/debtCancelation.jpg,debtCancelation.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/debtCancelation.jpg,2729,debtCancelation,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/debtCancelation.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Financial Help","Debt Help",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,try-this-for-debt-cancellation-youll-like-it,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:54"
3307,"Start Doing This Today If You Want To Buy A Home Soon","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

According to the National Association of Realtors, three out of every four renters would prefer to own a home. What’s stopping them from achieving that goal? The fact that over half cannot afford it.

Transitioning from renting to owning a home is not an overnight move. It is a possible one, however, as long as you start planning now.

When it comes to homeownership, two of the biggest obstacles are getting approved for a low-interest rate mortgage and saving enough for a down payment. We’ll reveal what you must do to overcome those obstacles soon so you can move into your home shortly.
<h3>How to Buy a Home in the Next Three Years</h3>
If three years sounds too soon to buy a home, it’s not. Follow these simple steps, and you’ll be well on your way to achieving that goal.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Check your credit score</h3>
You may be wary of checking your credit score for fear that it’s too low. Still, it’s better to know where you stand than to be in the dark since your credit score will play a significant part in securing a home loan. The higher your score, the better mortgage terms you can receive.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, nearly 20 percent of credit reports have errors. Just one mistake could lower your score, which is why checking it is a must.

You can get your credit score for free from Credit Sesame. While it won’t cost you a thing, it also won’t impact your score.

Once you have your score, the site will also give you a credit report card to let you know what needs fixing. By identifying your history’s weak points, you can address them to raise your score before applying for a mortgage.

How much of a score increase could you see? That depends on your situation, but it could be substantial. Three out of five Credit Sesame users see score increases, with 20 percent achieving boosts of 50-plus points within six months.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Keep your spending under control</h3>
Don’t let the temptation for other items keep you from saving for your home. For instance, buying an expensive car right now could affect your ability to buy a home soon.

If you use a loan to buy the car, your credit utilization rate can increase. This can decrease your credit score and affect eventual mortgage terms.

When you’re tempted to make a big purchase like a new car, electronics, jewelry, or a vacation using credit, remember your home-owning dreams. They could be put on hold should those not-so-necessary purchases start stacking up.

<h3>Start saving for that down payment</h3>
Saving takes a ton of discipline. If you find yourself having a hard time saving, you can use the Digs app as a virtual accountability partner.

Created with first-time homebuyers in mind, Digs motivates you to save by matching your contributions.

The goal is to get you to save over $1,000 per month for your first home. While it may sound impossible, Digs uses specific incentives to help you reach that goal, which will help you buy your home in the next few years.

3309,"4 Changes Worth Noting With This Year’s Medicare Open Enrollment","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’ve kept a close eye on your Medicare plans in the past, here are some differences you may see since the latest open enrollment period started.

<h3>Some Medicare Advantage plans are coming packed with new perks</h3>
Vision or dental coverage are a couple of extra benefits offered by many Medicare Advantage plans. While those certainly help keep your health and finances in order, more help could be on the way.

A plethora of Advantage plans will offer additional services that go above and beyond what’s covered in traditional medical care. Caregiver support and adult daycare are expected from approximately 500 plans, while 250 will add in perks like rides to grocery stores, meal delivery, and pest control.

Will having a plan that offers such services make you automatically eligible to receive them? No, as some will use specific conditions or chronic illnesses to determine eligibility.

Regardless, such growth in the number of services offered is a positive sign, and it could point to even more benefits in the future.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

When looking at plans, it’s essential to pay attention to the fine print. The fact that these new services that include even pest control won’t be rolled out to everyone in the plan could lead to disappointment.

According to some in the field, you won’t know if you’re eligible for certain supplemental benefits until you’re actually in the plan, so proceed with caution. While some plans may lure you with loads of bells and whistles, they may be features you never get to enjoy.

If you’re not happy with the Advantage plan you pick during the open enrollment, you can change it between January 1st and March 31st. Your options will be to switch to another Advantage plan that better suits your needs, or a standalone prescription plan and Original Medicare.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Changes in costs</h3>
Advantage plans carried an average premium of $27 in 2019. That number is expected to drop to $23 next year. This amount is in addition to your Part B premium, which is expected to increase $9 this year from $135.30 to $144.30, according to a Medicare Trustees report.

Deductibles will also rise. Medicare Part A deductibles are expected to jump from $1,364 to $1,420, while Part B deductibles will go from $185 to $197.
<h3>Prescription premiums should drop</h3>
Government estimates predict standalone prescription drug plan premiums to drop from $32.50 to $30.

<h3>The Plan Finder tool has been tweaked</h3>
Medicare.gov has a Plan Finder tool that makes it easier to compare your options before settling on one. If you’ve used it in the past, know that this year's version could take some getting used to.

3311,"Tips To Manage And Apply For Multiple Credit Cards At Once","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Many credit cards now come with attractive perks that can boost your bottom line in more ways than one.

For instance, you could have one credit card that offers great cash back bonuses. Another may give you miles for air travel so you never have to buy tickets. And you may also have cards that are great for balance transfers or have no annual fees.

Regardless of what you have multiple cards for, there are some rules to follow when managing and applying for them. If you fail to follow these rules, you could damage your credit, which can make it harder to get financing in the future.

With that out of the way, let’s look at ways to apply for and manage multiple credit cards at the same time.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How Applying for Multiple Credit Cards Affects Your Credit Score</h3>
Five components make up your credit score:
<ol>
 	<li>Length of credit history</li>
 	<li>Payment history</li>
 	<li>Credit utilization</li>
 	<li>Credit mix</li>
 	<li>New credit or credit inquiries</li>
</ol>
When you apply for more than one card at once, your credit utilization and credit inquiry components can be affected. Why is this significant? Because both make up a considerable chunk of your score, with credit utilization sitting at 30 percent and credit inquiries at 10 percent of the pie.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>The Inquiry Effect</h3>
Applying for a credit card puts a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may or may not affect your score. Some lenders will see a load of hard inquiries as a warning sign. This will force them to look at your credit history, when you opened your last account, and other factors to determine if you present an excessive risk as a borrower.

If you have a solid history, you won’t be affected by hard inquiries as much. If your past is spotty, however, those hard inquiries from applying to multiple cards could cause more trouble than they’re worth.

The longer your credit history, the less effect a hard inquiry will have. You may drop a few points in score if your history is short or your number of accounts is low. As for how long a hard inquiry will last on your credit report, the answer is two years.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h3>The Credit Utilization Effect</h3>
Many recommend keeping your credit utilization ratio under 30 percent. In other words, aim to use just 30 percent of your available credit across all cards and loans.

While opening multiple cards gives you more available credit and can lower your utilization ratio, it can backfire. Some creditors will look at those new accounts as risks that you may not be able to pay. Keep this in mind when filling out applications.

<h3>How to Manage Multiple Credit Cards</h3>
Here are some simple tips to follow when trying to increase your credit flexibility via various cards:
<ul>
 	<li>Research the benefits of each card before applying. If you already have a travel rewards card, for example, you may not need another that serves the same function.</li>
 	<li>To avoid the negative effect of hard inquiries, wait 90 days in between opening new accounts.</li>

However, not everyone has the required credit score to qualify for a standard mortgage loan. In such cases, they might still be eligible for an FHA loan, which is a government-backed mortgage offered to home buyers with poor credit history.

Mortgage lenders rely on a process called pre-approval to determine whether someone qualifies for a home loan. This process helps them determine the financial situation and payment ability of borrowers. Getting a FHA mortgage loan requires going through pre-approval. In this article, we explore how the FHA pre-approval process works.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What Is A Pre-Approval Process?</h4>
Pre-approval is a quite common process when it comes to mortgage loans. Most financial institutions will perform a pre-approval to evaluate a borrower’s economic situation and determine if they qualify for a loan. During the process, lenders check credit histories, verify current debt levels, and request proof of annual income. This information helps lenders calculate whether borrowers are in a position to pay back the loan, as well as how much money can be approved.

In general, pre-approval is usually requested by borrowers before searching for a home to purchase. Obtaining a letter of pre-approval gives borrowers an idea of how much money can they borrow from lenders, allowing them to narrow the search. Pre-approved homebuyers are often given privilege by real estate agents because they can receive financing. Also, it gives sellers assurance that the borrower is serious about buying a home.

However, pre-approval has its limitations. Letters of pre-approval are valid for a certain amount of time and do not guarantee that funding will indeed be received. Receiving pre-approved funds will depend on whether borrowers accept the terms and conditions set by lenders, such as payment options and interest rates.

A letter of pre-approval only means that the issuing financial institution is willing to approve a loan. Many borrowers have the misconception that being pre-approved by one institution is enough to obtain funding from any lender. However, mortgage lenders usually only give validity to letters of pre-approval they issued. If borrowers decide to seek funding somewhere else, they most likely will go through the pre-approval process once again.

Pre-approval is necessary to obtain a mortgage loan. FHA loan are no exception, as most financial institutions will have to determine whether an applicant meets specific FHA requirements. In the next section, we talk about FHA loans and their features.

<h4>What Is An FHA Mortgage Loan?</h4>
An FHA loan is a government-backed mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). An FHA mortgage loan requires a lower minimum credit score and down payment, which makes it popular among first-time homebuyers and low-income families. FHA loans were created during the 1930s to address high foreclosure and default rates caused by the Great Depression.

In general, lenders approve standard mortgage loans to homebuyers with credit scores above 620. Borrowers often put a down payment of between 3 and 20 percent and agree to adjustable interest rates to receive funding. In contrast, FHA mortgage loans are available to people with scores as low as 500, with a down payment of 10 percent and fixed interest rates. If their score is above 580, FHA-approved lenders ask for a smaller down payment of 3.5 percent. However, to offset additional risk, borrowers are required to pay mortgage insurance.

FHA mortgage loans remain the best alternative for low-income families who have struggled to save money for down payment. In recent years, FHA loans have been issued with hybrid interest rates to reduce mortgage insurance premiums. The FHA has also developed additional programs to help families cover down payments, including grants for low and very low income households.
<h4>How Does the FHA Pre-Approval Process Work?</h4>
The pre-approval process for an FHA loan has some significant differences compared to standard mortgages. For example, only FHA-approved lenders can issue such loans, and specific requirements must be met before the process can continue. Potential home buyers should contact a FHA-approved broker with experience in FHA loans to smoothen the pre-approval process. FHA loans are meant to purchase primary residences. As a result, borrowers who do not intend to occupy the house are generally not approved.

As we mentioned above, FHA mortgage loans are available to low income families with credit scores as low as 500. However, they must also meet some additional requirements before being pre-approved. First, borrowers must have no less than two years of steady employment in the same company or industry. During that period, their income must have remained the same or increased.

Second, borrowers must have no or few instances of late payments in their credit report. In general, mortgage lenders approve customers with less than two 30-day late payments in the last year. Those who have one 60-day or 90-day late payment are also considered as long as it only happened once in the past twelve months. However, some lenders might ignore these requirements if borrowers have sufficient income and prove that extreme circumstances where causing such late payments. In those cases, they must provide down payment and pay for mortgage insurance to offset the additional risk.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Borrowers with previous bankruptcies have to face additional challenges. In these cases, their bankruptcy discharge rate should not be within 24 months of the FHA case assignment. Additionally, their last foreclosure must have taken place more than three years before the loan application date. If foreclosure was related to a loan backed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), waiting periods might be longer. However, borrowers with previous foreclosures are generally not approved for an FHA mortgage loan.

Potential home buyers who comply with these requirements can move forward with the pre-approval process. Once they have contacted a broker and identified a FHA-approved mortgage lender, what comes next is the pre-approval request. This final step involves submitting the required paperwork and awaiting for the mortgage lender’s final decision. In the next section, we explore which documents mortgage lenders request, and why are they necessary to get pre-approved.
<h4>What Documents Are Required To Get Pre-Approved</h4>
Getting pre-approved for an FHA mortgage loan requires submitting a large amount of paperwork. Borrowers have to give mortgage lenders documents that prove their employment status, savings, credit history and tax documents. When it comes to personal information, lenders are usually satisfied with a government-issued document such as a social security card or driver’s license. However, other documents might be harder to compile.

FHA loans are only given to borrowers purchasing a primary residence. As a result, mortgage lenders require addresses of places where the borrower has lived in the last two years. In addition to that, they also require detailed information about employers during the same period, including company and boss names, monthly income and other benefits. To supplement that information, lenders need valid W-2 forms from the last two years, which include borrowers’ annual gross income and amount of withheld taxes.

Tax documentation is also necessary to get pre-approved. In general, mortgage lenders request tax returns for the past two years. Those who are employed must submit pay stubs for the last two months as well as an employment confirmation letter. Applicants who are self-employed must prove they have a steady income from their businesses. To do this, they must submit business tax returns, profit and loss statements and balance sheets. Paperwork related to a borrower’s assets is also required to successfully complete the pre-approval process.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Benefits of FHA Pre-Approval Process</h4>
Getting pre-approved for a FHA mortgage loan can be an exhausting process. During pre-approval, borrowers submit a long list of paperwork and give lenders permission to perform a hard inquiry on their credit history, which affects credit scores. However, the benefits of getting pre-approved makes it worth the trouble.

First, the pre-approval process helps families organize their documents for a future mortgage application. It also provides them with a tool to determine how much they can borrow. A significant number of home buyers don’t have a clear picture of their finances until they initiate the pre-approval process. Going through pre-approval is a useful method of determining the health of someone’s financial situation.

Second, borrowers with pre-approval letters have increased negotiating power during the search process. As mentioned above, real estate agents often prioritize buyers who are pre-approved. As a result, these borrowers have additional leverage when making an offer to buy their chosen home. Getting pre-approved removes a layer of uncertainty, giving sellers an assurance that individuals have the financial background needed to obtain financing.

Although it may seem like a good idea to get pre-approved for a FHA mortgage loan, borrowers should only do so when needed. The pre-approval process requires lots of paperwork and constitutes a hard inquiry on a person’s credit report. People with a high number of hard inquiries might lose credibility in the eyes of mortgage lenders, and thus be denied access to pre-approval. As a general rule, only go through pre-approval if you are going to purchase a home.","Getting a mortgage loan to purchase a home is a critical step in the financial evolution of a family.","2020-09-01 18:01:50",post,https://goodnesting.com/guide-to-fha-pre-approval-process/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fhaLoans.jpg,fhaLoans.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fhaLoans.jpg,2740,fhaLoans,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fhaLoans.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,guide-to-fha-pre-approval-process,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:56"
3315,"Mistakes First-Time Homebuyers Should Avoid","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

However, the majority of homebuyers lack critical information needed to get the best deal possible. This includes first-time homebuyers, which in 2017 made up over 34 percent of all home purchases nationwide.

First-time homebuyers often make mistakes when looking for a home to purchase. Most happen because of inexperience with how mortgages work, or eagerness to complete a transaction. However, avoiding these mistakes can help them save time, energy and thousands of dollars.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Looking for a home before applying for a mortgage</h4>
A significant number of first-time home buyers start looking for properties before talking to a mortgage lender. Doing so puts them at a disadvantage, as they may lose the chance to purchase their preferred home to other competitors.

In general, most real estate markets have some competition and only a few houses may go on sale every year. As a result, it is important that first-time home buyers be prepared to make an offer as soon as their chosen property becomes available. This can be done by asking for a pre-approval letter from a mortgage lender.

Most real estate brokers and home sellers give priority to buyers who have a letter of pre-approval. The reason is that such documents offer proof that a family has the financial background to get approved for a mortgage. Getting pre-approved also helps first-time home buyers narrow their search to include only properties they can afford.
<h4>Not shopping around for best rates</h4>
Another common mistake made by first-time home buyers is talking to only one mortgage lender. Although getting approved right away might look beneficial, doing so might close the door to better deals. To get the best interest rates and repayment terms, first-time home buyers should contact several mortgage lenders and compare their offers.

Most experienced loan officers recommend contacting at least three different mortgage lenders and make a comparison. They also recommend seeking advice from a mortgage broker experienced in the local real estate market. Homebuyers who do so can save thousands of dollars on interest rates, fees and closing costs.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Putting all of their savings towards down payment</h4>
Another common mistake made by first-time home buyers is putting all or most of their savings towards down payment and closing costs. As Ed Conarchy, a mortgage planner from Illinois explains, most first timers believe that putting as much money as possible for down payment is the best way to secure a mortgage loan. The reason why most try to reach 20 percent down payment is because it avoids mortgage insurance.

However, Mr. Conarchy explains that in most cases, it is better to pay mortgage insurance than being left with no savings. There are many unexpected expenses that may put a family in financial stress, including medical costs or car repairs. Draining their savings towards down payment will make it harder for them to meet monthly mortgage payments.

Choosing a cheaper home is one potential solution to avoid mortgage insurance without running out of cash. That way, homebuyers can save thousands of dollars otherwise spent in mortgage insurance and enjoy competitive interest rates and repayment terms.
<h4>Choosing a house they cannot afford to pay</h4>
First-time home buyers may feel tempted to go over budget and purchase a particular house they like. However, doing so can have significant negative effects if they go into financial hardship. The main risk of going over budget is foreclosure, but late payments can also impact credit scores.

Most mortgage brokers suggest looking at potential monthly payments to determine which house is affordable. In general, they recommend not going over fifty percent debt-to-income ratio when monthly mortgage payments are included. Debt-to-income ratio is a number that represents how much income goes into monthly debt payments. For example, a person who earns $3,000 each month will have a 33 percent debt-to-income ratio if their monthly debt payments total $1,000.

Focusing on monthly payments is a good way of avoiding excessive financial risk. First-time home buyers often pay attention instead to how much money they can borrow, which is not related to what they can afford.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Thinking 20 percent is the only down payment option</h4>
Most first-time home buyers assume they need 20 percent down payment to purchase a house. However, this is often not the case, as most mortgage lenders approve loans with much lower down payments in certain circumstances. If a family has good financial history, mortgage lenders will accept lower down payment amounts.

The main downside of not providing 20 percent down payment is being required to pay private mortgage insurance. This can increase monthly payments and add up to thousands of dollars in the long term. However, mortgage insurance gives families access to financing they would otherwise not have.

The amount of money paid as mortgage insurance is often determined by financial history. In general, homebuyers pay between 0.3 and 1.5 percent of the loan amount as mortgage insurance, regardless of down payment. As a result, families can put as little as 3.5 percent of the home's value as down payment without increasing mortgage insurance costs significantly. Also, mortgage insurance must only be paid until the remaining balance falls below 80 percent of the loan amount.

First-time home buyers also have access to local or state housing programs offering financial assistance. Federal initiatives such as FHA, USDA and VA loans are also a good way to purchase a home with low or no down payment. These programs come with mandatory mortgage insurance but have more generous interest rates and repayment terms.
<h4>Overlooking government-backed mortgage loans</h4>
House prices and mortgage rates have been rising in the last few years. This situation may put some families in a position where they do not have enough money for down payment. Others may no longer qualify for traditional mortgage loans. In such cases, people still have access to funding through government-backed mortgage programs.

There are three main agencies offering government-backed mortgage programs. They are the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). FHA loans are quite popular among first-time home buyers because of lower requirements. In general, families with credit scores above 500 are eligible for an FHA loan. Down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent. FHA loans also come with generous interest rates, often in the single digits, and mortgage insurance below one percent.

People who currently serve, or have previously served in any branch of the military, have access to special mortgage loans offered by the Department of Veteran Affairs. These loans have very generous interest rates, flexible requirements and no down payment. Instead, qualifying families must cover a funding fee that includes mortgage insurance. Surviving wives of deceased veterans also have access to these loans under special conditions.

Families living in rural areas can take advantage of home loans offered by the Department of Agriculture through its Rural Development program. These loans can be used to purchase homes located in select rural areas. Like VA loans, USDA mortgages have flexible requirements, which can include no down payment. for low and very-low income families.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Ignoring alternative methods to raise down payment</h4>
There are many different ways to come up with money to cover down payment. Most first-time home buyers believe that only their savings can be used for that purpose. However, mortgage lenders do not impose restrictions to where the money must come from.

First-time home buyers can use, for example, money gifted by family and friends to cover down payment. However, they will be required to provide extensive documentation, such as bank statements from benefactors. A written letter confirming that they money is a donation is also often necessary. First-time home buyers can also use money from a previous loan, as long as their final post-approval debt-to-income ratio is within lender requirements. In general, lenders approve loans to customers with debt-to-income ratios at or below 51 percent.

Crowdfunding is also an alternative to raise down payment money. Nowadays, people can set up a campaign in a crowdfunding platform such as HomeFundMe or FeatherTheNest.com and receive donations from hundreds of people around the country. This method has been available for only a few years, and has some limitations. However, it can be useful for young families expecting contributions from friends and family members living in other states or countries. HomeFundMe also offers up to $2,500 in matching contributions to help families raise money faster.

Another potential way of raising down payment is by requesting help from state and local governments. According to Rob Crane, CEO of DownPaymentResource.com, there are more than 2,500 programs designed to help first-time homebuyers raise down payment money. In Texas, for example, the local Department of Housing and Community Affairs offers 30-year fixed-rate mortgage assistance and down payment coverage of up to 5 percent of the loan amount.

The federal government also provides assistance through initiatives like the HOME Investment Partnership Program, which gives low-income families funding to purchase or renovate a property.","Purchasing a home is among the most significant financial decisions a family can make.","2020-09-01 18:06:08",post,https://goodnesting.com/mistakes-first-time-homebuyers-should-avoid/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeBuyer01.jpg,homeBuyer01.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeBuyer01.jpg,2773,homeBuyer01,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/homeBuyer01.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,mistakes-first-time-homebuyers-should-avoid,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:56"
3317,"The Process Of Getting A Second Mortgage","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

A second mortgage is a type of loan given to existing homeowners. Second mortgages have many benefits, including lower interest rates and generous borrowing limits. In this article, we explore what are second mortgages, how they work and how to apply for one.

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">How Does a Second Mortgage Work?</h4>

A second mortgage can get you a loan by using your existing home as collateral. It’s called second mortgage because it is “second” to the original loan that first purchased the home. A second mortgage is paid as a one-time lump sum of money that homeowners can use for whatever they want. Most borrowers request second mortgages because the interest rates or repayment schedule is more favorable than <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/how-to-refinance-your-mortgage/"">refinancing</a>.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Second mortgages are often paid out as Home Equity Lines of Credit or “HELOC.” In this case, the bank approves a pool of money the homeowner can draw from whenever they need it. A HELOC can be used and re-paid multiple times. This makes home equity lines of credit very useful for families who are looking for a safeguard against emergencies. A potential downside is that home equity lines of credit come with adjustable interest rates.

Second mortgages affect the equity of a home, which equals their market value after discounting any remaining loan balances. The equity of a home fluctuates constantly according to local market prices and other financial factors, although most houses grow in value over time. Because second mortgages are subordinate to an original mortgage loan, they often come with higher interest rates to offset the additional risk. If a default happens, proceeds from liquidation will be given to the first mortgage lender until it is paid off. Any extra money is then awarded to whoever approved the second mortgage.

<h4>Benefits and Disadvantages of Second Mortgages</h4>

Second mortgages have superior benefits when compared to other types of debt. The amount of money that can be borrowed through a second mortgage is significant. In general, homeowners have access to as much as 80 percent of their home’s value. However, that number includes any outstanding balance from the first mortgage. For example, if a family owns a $200,000 house and still owes $100,000 on their first mortgage, the maximum amount available to borrow will be $60,000.

Another benefit of second mortgages is their low interest rates. Because these loans are secured by a home, financial institutions are more willing to give generous repayment terms to borrowers. In general, most second mortgages have interest rates in the single digits, which is much lower than unsecured personal loans such as credit cards. In some cases, homeowners can take a mortgage interest tax deduction if they used the loaned money to improve their homes.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

The benefits of second mortgages come with some significant tradeoffs. For many families, the main disadvantage of a second mortgage is that it raises risk of <a href=""http://goodnesting.com/buying-a-foreclosed-home/"">foreclosure</a>. To obtain a second mortgage, homeowners have to put their houses as collateral. If their financial condition deteriorates and they are unable to pay, the bank can force foreclosure. Because of this, second mortgages are rarely used to finance recurrent expenses. Unsecured personal loans, although with higher interest rates, are a less risky option.

Another downside of second mortgages is the amount of money spent during the application process. Closing costs such as credit checks, home inspection, appraisals and origination fees can add up to several thousand dollars. Some financial institutions promise their customers no closing costs, but some expenses still have to be covered by homeowners.

<h4>How to Get a Second Mortgage</h4>

There are several things to consider before applying for a second mortgage. Homeowners should calculate the risk they are taking, and what impact a second mortgage will have on monthly bills. Preparing a budget is an effective way to visualize how affordable these payments will be. In general, homeowners should spend no more than a third of their income in housing costs, including mortgage payments, utilities, property taxes and insurance.

The second step is to determine how the money will be spent, and choose what kind of home equity loan better adapts to those needs. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are better for families who anticipate future spending and want to be prepared. HELOCs work like credit cards, as homeowners only have to pay interest on what they borrow. In contrast, home equity loans are better if the family has a precise spending plan, such as to perform home improvements or purchase a new vehicle.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

The next step is to determine how much equity is available. This number is used by financial institutions to calculate how much money they can loan to a homeowner. This process is completed by appraising the house, which helps determine its current market value. The appraisal process is done by a real estate professional and often adds any new additions (such as a pool or fence) to what homeowners paid when they purchased the house.

Once the market value and home equity have been determined, homeowners can contact their preferred financial institution to request a second mortgage. Families with a good financial history will often get their bank to approve a home equity loan without much trouble. However, exploring the market for better rates is always a good idea. Most customers stick to their banks, which gives them the power to offer less competitive rates overall.

Submitting the loan application is a very straightforward process. The financial institution will request documentation and offer several options to choose from. Homeowners can choose how much they want to borrow, if they want adjustable or fixed interest rates, and other repayment conditions. Once the application is approved, the bank will either deposit the money or create a home equity line of credit. If needed, homeowners can choose to <a href=""http://goodnesting.com/adding-a-co-borrower-to-your-mortgage/""> add a co-borrower to their mortgage application</a> to improve their chances and obtain more generous terms.

Millions of homeowners apply for a second mortgage every year. Some do to improve their homes while others invest the money in education, a business or medical emergency. Although asking for a second mortgage may seem like an easy solution to a problem, homeowners should always weight the risk of putting their homes on the line.","For most families, a home is their most valuable asset.

This process allows homeowners to renegotiate the original repayment terms on their mortgages. The result can be lower monthly payments or, if the family has a higher credit score, lower interest rates or additional financing.

Refinancing is a popular practice among homeowners. In 2017, refinance requests represented almost 40 percent of all mortgage applications. However, the benefits of this process are unknown to many families, who miss out on thousands of dollars in savings by not refinancing on time. In this article, we explain why and how to refinance your mortgage, steps to complete the process, and more.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Why people refinance their mortgage</h4>
Homeowners must understand why they want to refinance their mortgage before starting the process. The reason to refinance will have significant ramifications along the way. Most families refinance their mortgage to lower payments. However, some homeowners do so to <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/consolidate-your-debt-with-a-home-equity-loan/"">obtain additional funding under the same loan</a> instead of applying for an unsecured personal loan or second mortgage.

Families refinancing their mortgage to lower monthly payments should avoid some common mistakes. For example, it may seem attractive to reset the term and get lower monthly payments, but doing so means it will take longer to pay off the loan. Also, it will increase the total amount of money paid as interest. In general, homeowners should calculate how much interest they’ve already paid before making a decision to refinance.

Financial institutions front-load mortgage loans with interest to reduce risk. The longer a family has been paying off their loan, the more each payment contributes to the principal. Resetting the term while refinancing will also affect how much each payment contributes to reducing the principal. In some circumstances, it might be better to continue with the current term and negotiate lower interest rates.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Using a mortgage refinance calculator</h4>
Finding a compelling reason to refinance is only the first step. Next, they have to work out the details using resources such as a mortgage refinance calculator. In general, homeowners should know what interest rate they expect to get, as well as the size of the new loan, after refinancing is complete. Using a mortgage refinance calculator, the family can determine how much money will be saved through refinancing, as well as other details such as new monthly payments and interest rates. The calculator usually includes the cost of refinancing.

Calculating the potential outcome of a mortgage refinance before submitting an application is always a good idea. Doing so gives families a clear picture of what benefits will be obtained when the process is complete, and whether it’s worth it to refinance in the first place.

Sometimes, refinancing a mortgage means spending thousands of dollars in exchange for an insignificant payment or interest rate reduction. In such a case, it may not be reasonable to move forward. However, the most effective way to reach such a conclusion is by calculating the costs and estimated benefits beforehand. Whether the calculation is performed using a refinance calculator or manually is up to each homeowner.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Shopping for the best refinance rates</h4>
Once the decision to move forward has been made, what follows involves shopping around for estimates from financial institutions. Nowadays, most lenders allow customers to request an estimate though their website or by making a phone call. By law, financial institutions are obliged to issue an estimate within three days of being sent the required information.

In general, estimates are three-page documents informing the customer what the financial institution can offer according to their credit history. It usually includes loan terms, estimated monthly payments, interest rates, closing costs, and other fees.

With information provided by financial institutions, customers can improve their calculations to determine which one has the best mortgage refinance rates. Homeowners should keep in mind that closing costs and fees vary according to how each financial institution operates. For example, some lenders will charge customers no closing costs.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">The process of refinancing</h4>
As we´ve already mentioned, homeowners should calculate the estimated benefits of refinancing before contacting a financial institution. Checking their credit score and financial history is a good way of anticipating the potential interest rates offered by a bank. Appraising their homes is also necessary to determine whether the house has increased in value, giving homeowners access to more equity.

After the shopping period is complete, homeowners should know how much exactly will cost to refinance their mortgage. This process often triggers many hidden costs, including appraisal and origination fees. In general, financial institutions are required to disclose those costs when they issue an estimate. However, some tell customers there are no closing costs, while they charge higher interest rates.

Once a specific bank has been selected, what comes next is to gather the required documents. Financial institutions usually request all sorts of documents, including personal identification, bank statements, and more. Nowadays, some lenders allow customers to submit paperwork through their website. However, some still require visiting a local branch to finish the application process.

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Getting a mortgage rate lock</h4>
After the necessary paperwork has been submitted, homeowners have to decide whether they want to lock the mortgage refinance interest rate. A mortgage rate lock is a compromise made by a lender where they guarantee the interest rate of a loan for a period of time. Families who refinance an <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/what-are-fha-loans/"">FHA loan</a> are often given a mortgage rate lock once they start the process.

Some financial institutions charge customers a fee to perform a mortgage rate lock, although homeowners with high credit scores may receive this guarantee at no cost. Mortgage rate locks generally last from loan approval and until closing. Their purpose is to streamline the underwriting process, shielding it from mortgage interest rate fluctuations, which happen quite often.

Homeowners can take advantage of mortgage rate locks to save thousands of dollars when refinancing their home loan. However, if interest rates are expected to go down during the application process, locking them might result in a loss of additional savings. Predicting how mortgage interest rates will behave requires a comprehensive understanding of local housing markets, which average families don’t have. Making the decision to lock a mortgage rate will depend on what homeowners consider to be the best course of action.

Refinancing a mortgage is a comprehensive process that, when done right, can save thousands of dollars on monthly payments. As a result, families need to do whatever they can to make sure they understand the process and aren’t ignoring any important details.

Having cash on hand is critical to complete the process without much hassle, as property taxes, insurance, closing costs and other fees will have to be covered out of pocket. In some cases, these expenses can be added to a mortgage balance, but doing so might defeat the purpose of refinancing in he first place.

However, a significant number of people don’t have the required credit score to access standard mortgage loans. In such cases, they might still qualify for an FHA loan, which is a government-backed mortgage program offered to people with a weak financial history.

FHA loans have helped millions of first-time home buyers successfully purchase properties. However, there are some requirements that must be met before getting approved for an FHA loan. In this article, we explore what are FHA loans, what is required to qualify for one, and their limits and benefits compared to standard mortgages.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">FHA loans were created as a response to the Great Depression, and have more generous terms than standard mortgages</h4>
An FHA loan is a mortgage backed by the U.S. government. These loans are offered by financial institutions which have been approved by the Federal Housing Association, or FHA. Lenders agree to issue FHA backed loans because the government agrees to make good if the borrower does not pay.

FHA loans are quite popular among first-time home buyers because they have much lower requirements when compared to standard mortgage loans. For example,<strong> people can qualify for an FHA loan with a credit score as low as 500</strong>, giving only 10 percent down payment. Families with scores above 580 are given a more generous offer, as they have to put a down payment of only 3.5 percent. These terms are quite different than standard mortgage loans, which might require a minimum score of 620 and a down payment of 20 percent.

FHA mortgage loans remain the best alternative for low-income families who have struggled to save money for down payment. In recent years, lenders have been issuing <strong>hybrid FHA loans</strong>, which combine a portion of fixed and variable interest rates. These mortgages start out with fixed interest rates for several years before switching to adjustable rates. The federal government has also developed additional grant programs that help low and very low income households cover down payments. One such program is called Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere, or HOPE, and was designed to help families buy public housing units with funds provided by nonprofit organizations.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">People who want to obtain funding through an FHA loan must meet certain income and employment requirements</h4>
People who want to get approved for an FHA loan have to meet specific requirements designed by the Federal Housing Administration and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The first requirement is to have a credit score within stipulated limits. In general, people with credit scores from 500 to 579 are approved with a 10 percent down payment. If their credit score is above 580, down payment falls to 3.5 percent. Down payment money can come from a verified gift or federal assistance program. Some local housing authorities operate grant programs that help very low income families cover down payment.

Borrowers should be aware that FHA loans are only approved for primary residences. If families do not intend to live in the property, they must look for other funding sources. Only properties which have been appraised by an FHA-approved appraiser can be purchased with these loans. Properties must also meet other HUD guidelines before they are added to the list. To find out which properties in their area meet these requirements, borrowers are advised to contact an experienced broker.

When it comes to income, FHA loans have more generous requirements than what financial institutions ask for standard mortgages. For example, housing authorities do not have set annual income requirements, though borrowers must have enough to cover potential monthly payments. To verify income, FHA-approved lenders ask for documents that certify steady employment for at least two years without salary decrease. In general, lenders are satisfied with pay stubs, federal tax returns, bank statements and employment letters. Most of these documents will be reviewed <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/guide-to-fha-pre-approval-process/"">during the pre-approval process</a>.

Financial institutions offering FHA loans have some additional debt requirements that must be met before approving an application. First, borrowers’ front-end debt ratio must not exceed 31 percent of their gross monthly income. This includes monthly debt payments except for mortgages. Some lenders may allow as much as 40 percent front-end debt ratio under certain conditions. Second, borrowers’ back-end debt ratio should be lower than 43 percent. This includes mortgages and all other monthly debt payments. In some cases, borrowers with up to 50 percent back-end debt ratio may be approved for an FHA loan.

Finally, borrowers must wait at least two years after a bankruptcy and three years after a foreclosure before applying for an FHA loan. They should have also improved their financial history to meet other requirements such as a credit score of at least 500. People who have foreclosures related to government-backed loans might have to wait longer. However, people with previous foreclosures are generally not approved for an FHA loan unless they happened under extreme circumstances.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">People approved for an FHA loan pay mortgage insurance to offset additional risk caused by lower requirements</h4>
In general, mortgage insurance is required when down payment is less than 20 percent of the loan amount. Mortgage insurance protects lenders if borrowers default on their loans. The most common type is private mortgage insurance, which is paid for by borrowers when they purchase a home. FHA loans have significantly low down payments. As a result, borrowers are required to pay two mortgage insurance premiums.

The first one is called upfront mortgage insurance premium. It equals 1.75 percent of the loan amount and must be paid when the mortgage is approved. However, most financial institutions allow borrowers to roll the mortgage premium into the total loan amount. The second premium is called annual mortgage insurance. It goes from 0.45 to 1.05 percent of the loan amount and is paid monthly along with mortgage payments.

[the_ad id=""4223""]<!-- Media.net -->

The final percentage is determined by the total loan amount, loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and credit score. Annual mortgage insurance is paid until the loan-to-value ratio reaches a certain amount. Usually, borrowers stop paying when the value reaches 78 percent of the purchased home’s original appraisal value or current sales price, whichever is lower.
<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Like standard mortgages, FHA loans have closing costs that vary according to circumstances</h4>
FHA loans have closing costs that must be paid when borrowers get approved. However, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) limits how much FHA-approved lenders can charge in closing costs. In general, FHA mortgages have closing costs of around 3 to 5 percent of the total loan amount. The final number will depend on where borrowers live, loan size, and whether some practices are used to lower interest rates.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) allows home sellers, builders and lenders to cover part of the total closing costs. In general, real estate agents and homebuilders cover appraisals, credit reports and title expenses to push borrowers towards purchasing a new home. In contrast, lenders often increase interest rates when they agree to pay closing costs. Borrowers can request assistance from an experienced broker to determine which option is more affordable for them.

Buying a home is a significant step towards financial stability. Yet a large number of families do not have what it takes to get approved for a standard mortgage loan. For them, it might be worth it to explore if an FHA loan suits their needs. FHA loans allow low income families to accomplish that critical home purchase. Although the process might seem complicated and exhausting, being granted funds to become a homeowner has enduring benefits.",,"2020-09-01 19:45:22",post,https://goodnesting.com/how-to-purchase-a-home-with-no-money/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_337520291.jpg,shutterstock_337520291.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_337520291.jpg,2833,shutterstock_337520291,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_337520291.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,how-to-purchase-a-home-with-no-money,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-19 18:20:34"
3323,"Almost Every Homeowner Pays Less After Doing This","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

With rising interest rates, such payments can put a family in financial hardship. However, homeowners who have available equity on their properties can avoid this by consolidating their non-mortgage debt with a home equity loan.

Home equity loans have much lower interest rates and generous repayment terms than credit cards, medical bills and car loans. Homeowners can take advantage of these loans to save money on interest and simplify their monthly bills. However, there are some things to consider before asking for a home equity loan or line of credit.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">What is a home equity loan?</h4>
A home equity loan is a financial product used by homeowners to get funding using their home’s equity as collateral. These loans are <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/the-process-of-getting-a-second-mortgage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">also known as second mortgages</a>, although that name is mostly used when a lien is already placed on the property used as collateral. Home equity loans can be provided as a one lump-sum of money or line of credit.

Home equity loans given as a single lump-sum of money work like any other loan. Once customers get approved, lenders deposit the money in a designated bank account for borrowers to use. Most home equity loans have no limits on how the money can be used. However, borrowers may receive lower interest rates and more generous repayment terms if the money is used to perform home repairs or improvement.

Borrowers can also request the money be provided as a line of credit instead. In those cases, they receive a home equity line of credit, or HELOC, which can be used and re-paid multiple times. HELOCs are very useful to families who are looking for a safeguard against emergencies instead of money to cover an immediate expense.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Benefits of home equity loans</h4>

Home equity loans and lines of credit have many benefits, especially when it comes to consolidating debt. In general, banks consider credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other financial data to determine how much money they can lend customers. This is often not the case for home equity loans. In most cases, homeowners have access to as much as 80 percent of their home’s equity as loan amount. This is because unlike credit cards and unsecured loans, home equity loans are guaranteed by an existing asset.

There are some specific benefits that home equity loans offer someone trying to consolidate debt. First, borrowers who consolidate debt with a home equity loan will only have to worry about one monthly payment. This can help families better organize their finances when compared to handling different due dates for medical bills, credit card debt and car loans.
The second benefit of home equity loans is that they help borrowers know when their debt will be paid off. Most families pay off credit card debt while they continue using them frequently. This makes figuring out a payoff date complicated, as new debt often extends payment periods. A home equity loan comes with a certain number of monthly payments, which remain unchanged unless borrowers <a class=""hyperl"" href=""http://goodnesting.com/how-to-refinance-your-mortgage/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">refinance their loan</a>.

For example, a consumer owes $10,000 in credit card debt and decides to pay down $3,000 each year, in monthly payments of $250. The interest rate on their credit card is 18 percent. After twelve months, consumers would still owe $8,800 due to interest. If consumers spend an additional $1,000 during the year, their balance would be around $9,900. Without new spending, it would take consumers 62 months to pay off their debt.

The third benefit of home equity loans is their much lower interest rates. Using the example above, it would take a homeowner 36 months to pay off a $10,000 home equity loan with a 5 percent interest rate and monthly payments of $300. Total interest paid on the loan would be around $800, which is much lower than the $5,400 paid on interest had they kept the balance on their credit card. By consolidating their debt with a home equity loan, the consumer saved $4,600.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Most home equity lines of credit come with adjustable interest rates. This means that the total amount of money saved in comparison to credit card debt will vary. However, HELOCs still have much lower interest rates that credit cards, and unlike home equity loans, can be reused even after being paid off. Also, customers who are still paying off their mortgages can request borrowing limit increases on their HELOC as they make monthly payments.

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Consolidating debt using home equity</h4>
The first step to consolidate is calculating how much money will be required to cover debt payments. For example, a family that owes $10,000 in credit card debt, $5,000 in medical bills, and $13,000 on a car loan would require a $28,000 home equity loan or line of credit. Families who have a precise spending plan may prefer a home equity loan due to lower interest rates. However, applying for a line of credit might be beneficial if they expect new spending in the near future.

Once families know how much money is needed, the second step is to determine available equity. As explained above, most lenders provide up to 80 percent of a home’s equity as loan amount. This number includes other liens on the property, such as other mortgages. For example, if a family owns a $200,000 house and still owes $100,000 on their first mortgage, the maximum amount available to borrow will be $60,000.

In some cases, appraising the property will be needed to see if its current market value matches the original sale price. The appraisal process is often performed by real estate professionals, who take into consideration new additions such as a pool or fence. However, if the house has remained largely in a similar state, borrowers might bypass the appraisal process to save money. Most real estate professionals can charge between $300 and $500 to perform an appraisal. This is a significant expense that reduces the amount of money saved by consolidating debt.

Once the market value has been determined, homeowners can contact several lenders to compare interest rates, closing costs and other fees. Families with good credit histories are often approved the maximum loan amount without much trouble. However, interest rates and closing costs are usually similar for families with weaker financial histories. In general, interest rates for a home equity loan or second mortgage varies between 3 and 8 percent.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

Some financial institutions offer borrowers a promotional interest rate for the first twelve to thirty-six monthly payments. For example, State Farm Bank offers home equity lines of credit with a promotional interest rate of 2.9 percent. After twelve months, the rate changes to 6.85 percent. Watertown Savings Bank, in contrast, offers a promotional rate of 4.2 percent for 36 months before increasing it to 6 percent.

Another important factor to consider when comparing HELOCs is the minimum initial draw amount. Bank of America, for example, requires borrowers to draw at least $50,000. If a family only needs $28,000, such an amount would not make sense. In general, borrowers are required to draw between $10,000 and $15,000 to get approved for a HELOC, although small banks and credit unions have no such limits.

Once a lender and amount have been chosen, the final step is submitting an application. During the process, lenders will ask for relevant documentation and verify whether homeowners meet their financial standards. In general, lenders approve loan applications from customers with a credit score at or above 620, debt-to-income ratio below 43 percent, and history of paying bills on time. Some lenders accept debt-to-income ratios as high as 50 percent, though with higher interest rates.

<h4 style=""line-height: 34px;"">Things to consider when consolidating debt with home equity</h4>
Homeowners must consider several factors when calculating how much money they would save by consolidating debt. The process of requesting a home equity loan or line of credit can become complicated and time-consuming. Several steps, such as appraisal, can take weeks or even months. This means that families who need the money right away might be better off applying for a personal loan.

Another important factor to consider is risk. Home equity loans and lines of credit are secured loans which use a property as collateral. Homeowners who are unprepared to make their monthly payments on time may face foreclosure and lose their homes. Families should only apply for a home equity loan if they are able to cover monthly payments. In most cases, it is less risky to default or skip payments on unsecured debt, as doing so does not pose an immediate risk to families.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

Home equity loans and lines of credit often have expensive closing costs attached to them. Before applying for one, homeowners should calculate how much would it cost to get approved. Otherwise, they may end up not saving as much money as possible, or spending more money in the long term.

However, many families, including first timers, are having trouble putting money aside to get approved for a mortgage. Although not all mortgage programs require 20 percent down payment to proceed, rising home prices have made it difficult for families to gather enough money.

There are alternative ways to raise money to cover down payment. Crowdfunding, family gifts and retirement savings accounts are all valid sources of money. In this article, we explain how home buyers can take advantage of these methods to overcome the challenge of saving enough down payment for a mortgage.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Not all mortgage lenders require 20 percent down payment</h4>
Some first-time homebuyers think that they need no less than 20 percent down payment to purchase a house. However, although most lenders prefer receiving as much, there are lower down payment options that better suit the needs of families buying their first home.

The federal government operates several mortgage programs that require from 10 percent to no down payment at all. The best known mortgage programs are run by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and U.S. Departments of Veteran Affairs (VA) and Agriculture (DA). These loans are often approved with no down payment, although borrowers must agree to cover a funding fee. Mortgage insurance is also often a mandatory requirement for government-backed loans.

Some financial institutions also offer non-government backed home loans, also known as commercial mortgages, with low down payment, to first-time homebuyers. For example, Wells Fargo offer conventional fixed-rate mortgage loans with a down payment as low as 3 percent. Bank of America, in contrast, requires at least 5 percent down payment. In both cases, annual mortgage insurance will be required.

Finding ways to get approved for a mortgage loan with a down payment lower than 20 percent is only the first step. The money still has to be raised some way. Also, borrowers must be aware that lower down payment often means higher interest rates and monthly payments. As a result, a balance must be achieved in order to avoid a situation where monthly payments become a financial burden.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Use crowdfunding platforms to raise down payment</h4>
Crowdfunding is the process of funding a project by receiving small sums of money from a large number of people. This alternative financing strategy has existed for many decades, although it only gained in popularity as the Internet became more available. By 2011, crowdfunding platforms like IndieGoGo, Kickstarter and GoFundMe had gained widespread popularity. According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, more than $34 billion were raised through crowdfunding in 2015 alone.

Raising money for down payment is not allowed on most major crowdfunding platforms. In general, Kickstarter and IndieGoGo are meant to help small businesses receive funding to complete commercial projects such as toys, books, movies and video games. GoFundMe, on the other hand, is usually the place to get funding for life-threatening circumstances, such as expensive surgery or cancer treatment. However, GoFundMe does allow people to create campaigns to raise money for down payment.

In recent years, crowdfunding platforms focused on helping homebuyers raise down payment have appeared. One of the most popular options is HomeFundMe, created by mortgage banking firm CMG Financial. The website provides homebuyers assistance raising down payment for a mortgage loan. It also gives several unique benefits to users, such as being able to apply for mortgage prequalification once they register. Unlike other crowdfunding websites, HomeFundMe does not take a cut from contributions received through the platform.

HomeFundMe has some caveats. First, users must complete a homebuyer education course and can only use raised money to apply for a mortgage with CMG Financial. Also, they have up to twelve months to raise enough money to cover down payment and complete the mortgage application process. This means they are tied to whichever payment terms and interest rates CMG Financial offers, without the possibility to look for alternatives. However, the company usually matches contributions according to average median income, up to $2,500, helping families raise down payment even if contributions are scarce.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Those who want more freedom can choose FeatherTheNest.com. This crowdfunding platform can be used by first time homebuyers to build an online profile where people can submit contributions towards down payment. The website provides comprehensive assistance when managing a crowdfunding campaign, including social media.

To receive the money, users create a ""nest,"" which can be shared through social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The nest is linked to a bank account where contributions are stored during the campaign. FeatherTheNest.com does have transaction fees of 5 percent per contribution. Also, the credit card company in charge of handling the funding process charges an additional 3 percent. That means a family must raise $21,740 to complete a $20,000 down payment campaign.
<h4>Receive gifts or loans directly from family members or close friends willing to help</h4>
Receiving money from family members and close friends is another way of raising down payment. However, this method requires a significant amount of paperwork in order to satisfy mortgage lenders. This is because lenders want to make sure that a homebuyer is not borrowing money to cover down payment. If so, the risk of defaulting on their mortgage increases.

Lenders also require extensive paperwork because they must verify that benefactors have the financial capacity to make such donations. This often means family members will have to provide bank statements and other financial data that supports income. A letter confirming that the money is indeed a donation is also necessary.

If a family member provides the money as a loan, lenders will have to take it into account when analyzing borrowers' applications. One key area affected by loaned down payment money is debt-to-income ratio, which represents how much income goes toward paying existing debt accounts. As the family loan was taken before the mortgage is approved, it is considered as existing debt, raising debt-to-income ratio.

In some cases, accepting money from family members with promise of paying it back might put borrowers above the maximum debt-to-income ratio accepted by lenders. In general, most mortgage lenders reject applications when borrowers have a debt-to-income ratio above 50 percent. However, exceptions can be made if some existing debt accounts are expected to be fully paid back in the near future.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Look for assistance from state and local sources</h4>
Another potential way of raising down payment money is by requesting help from local and state governments. According to Rob Crane, CEO of DownPaymentResource.com, there are more than 2,500 programs designed to help first-time homebuyers raise down payment money.

Down payment assistance programs are usually grants given by local governments to low income families. For example, the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs offers 30-year fixed-rate mortgage assistance and down payment coverage of up to 5 percent of the loan amount. The federal government also provides assistance through the HOME Investment Partnership Program, which gives low-income families funding to purchase or renovate a property.

Some non-profit organizations and local employers are also known to provide financial assistance to workers and volunteers. One of the most popular non-profits is Habitat for Humanity, which helps families build and renovate properties. Banks like Wells Fargo also run non-profit foundations that help low income families gain access to affordable housing.

The amount of money received through local and state programs can be significant. A 2016 study completed by Attom Data Solutions reported that, on average, families received up to $6,000 to cover down payment. The study also found out that families often received an additional $11,000 in monthly payment assistance.
<h4>Using retirement savings to fund down payment</h4>
Families who have retirement savings accounts may use a portion of that money to cover down payment. Although some might see it as risking their future, using 401(k) plans as a source for down payment has some benefits.

First, having a home which constantly rises in price may be better than keeping cash inside a retirement savings account. The interest rate offered by 401(k) and other IRAs can be lower than the average annual increase in home prices. Second, homes are an asset which can be used to borrow money later on if needed. Using a 401(k) does not mean the money goes away. Instead, it is transformed into equity.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->

However, borrowing or withdrawing money from a retirement savings account often has penalties. Contributors who are younger than 59½ years usually have to pay a penalty, and in the case of a 401(k), income taxes. Also, if someone withdraws money and then loses their job, some special conditions such as immediate repayment may become a problem.

If money is withdrawn from a Roth IRA, income taxes are not a concern as money stored in such accounts has already been taxed. However, IRAs allow only up to $10,000 to be withdrawn for home purchases.

Down payment is only one of the many items homebuyers have to worry about. Those who are buying a home for the first time should also seek to avoid common mistakes that might make the process more difficult. However, most families who complete a purchase have found their way out of financial hardship.","Saving for down payment is the first step on the road to homeownership.","2020-09-01 15:08:09",post,https://goodnesting.com/internet-strangers-can-fund-your-home-purchase/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_691089019.jpg,shutterstock_691089019.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_691089019.jpg,2852,shutterstock_691089019,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_691089019.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,"Habitat for Humanity",publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,internet-strangers-can-fund-your-home-purchase,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:56"

However, in most cases it means agreeing to pay for mortgage insurance, which is financial protection for lenders if you default.

Mortgage insurance is one of many upfront and ongoing costs of purchasing a home with low down payment. In certain circumstances, mortgage insurance can be avoided or removed. In this article, we offer guidance about private mortgage insurance and how to deal with it.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>What is private mortgage insurance?</h4>
Private mortgage insurance, or PMI, is an insurance policy paid by borrowers when taking out a mortgage loan. Unlike traditional insurance, which protects policyholders against losses, private mortgage insurance policies protect lenders instead. It is meant as a way to reduce risk and potential losses when borrowers default on their mortgages.

Not all mortgage loans come with private mortgage insurance. In general, borrowers who provide close to 20 percent of the home's value as down payment are not required to carry private mortgage insurance. However, borrowers who provide less than 10 percent as down payment, or who are approved for some government-sponsored mortgage programs, are often required to do so. This is because most private mortgage insurance policies expire once the remaining principal balance falls below 80 percent of the original appraised value, or current market value, of the property.

The cost of a private mortgage insurance policy will depend on the size and type of home loan, down payment, financial history and credit score. On average, borrowers can pay an additional 0.3 to 1.5 percent of the loan amount as mortgage insurance. For example, someone with a credit score above 580, putting 3.5 percent as down payment to purchase a home through an FHA mortgage loan may be required to contract a 1.25 percent private mortgage insurance. However, if they provide 10 percent down payment, their mortgage insurance rate could be 0.3 percent instead.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Can private mortgage insurance be cancelled?</h4>
A private mortgage insurance policy does not last forever. Its purpose is to offset the additional risk of approving a mortgage loan with less than 20 percent down payment. As a result, they usually expire once homeowners make enough monthly payments to reach 20 percent equity on their properties.

For example, a family who put 10 percent down payment to purchase a $100,000 home starts with $10,000 in equity. To cancel their private mortgage insurance, they would need to make enough monthly payments to reach $20,000 in equity. However, that is not the only way of cancelling private mortgage insurance.

A homeowner can often cancel their private mortgage insurance if the value of their property falls below the originally appraised value. However, their equity must represent at least 20 percent of the home's new market value to do so. Using the example above, six and a half years would be required to reach 20 percent equity if the house was purchased through a 30-year mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of about 5 percent. However, if after five years the property's value falls to $75,000, the owner would be able to cancel the private mortgage insurance ahead of time.

Having 20 percent equity is the most important step to cancel a private mortgage insurance policy. However, lenders also consider delinquencies and other active liens on the property. If someone meets equity requirements but has a history of late payments, their cancellation request may be denied. The same often happens if they have a second mortgage.

<h4>Mortgage insurance and government-backed loans</h4>
Home loans backed by the U.S. government follow unique rules with regards to mortgage insurance. Affected by special rules are loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). These rules are in place to make sure these loans are affordable for all income groups, including single mothers.

Mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration require both upfront and annual mortgage insurance. This rule applies regardless of down payment. As of 2018, the upfront fee is 1.75 percent of the loan amount, and annual mortgage insurance rates range from 0.45 to 1.05 percent. The final rate will depend on factors such as loan term and amount.

Mortgage insurance cannot be cancelled for loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration. Prior to 2013, FHA loans operated under the same rules as other commercial mortgages. However, since that year, all FHA loans come with mortgage insurance policies that last for at least 11 years, and in some cases, for the entire loan term.

Loans backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture also have both upfront and annual mortgage insurance fees. The upfront guarantee fee equals one percent of the loan amount, while the annual mortgage insurance equals 0.35 percent. The upfront payment, often referred to as the USDA funding fee, is paid along all other closing costs. The annual fee cannot be cancelled and is paid for the entire loan term.

VA loans do not require mortgage insurance. Instead, they have an upfront funding fee that replaces both down payment and mortgage insurance. The fee varies depending on loan amount and nature of military service. In general, it ranges from 1.25 to 3.3 percent of the total loan amount, and is paid along with all other closing costs.

<h4>Avoiding private mortgage insurance</h4>
Private mortgage insurance gives families access to financing they would otherwise not have. It also gives lenders more flexibility when setting up down payment requirements. However, paying mortgage insurance can become a significant burden, as it increases monthly payments. In some cases, families can pay as much as $150 each month in mortgage insurance, which adds up to thousands of dollars.

Purchasing a home is more than just asking for a mortgage loan. Most families also have to deal with homeowners association fees, property taxes, home warranties and home insurance. When those additional costs are factored in, monthly house-related expenses can add up to a thousand dollars or more.

Avoiding private mortgage insurance is one way of reducing monthly bills. Although it might require putting down a larger down payment, doing so has additional benefits, such as lower interest rates, closing costs and monthly payments. Lenders often give homebuyers with good financial histories more flexible terms, which may include no private mortgage insurance in exchange for a small increase in down payment.
<h4>Getting rid of private mortgage insurance</h4>
Mortgage insurance is often one of the first expenses families want to get rid of once they start paying back their home loan. Cancelling a private mortgage insurance policy can be achieved in several ways.

The first and most straightforward way of getting rid of private mortgage insurance is waiting for automatic cancellation. Most lenders are required to cancel mortgage insurance when a mortgage reaches a 78 percent loan-to-value ratio or when homeowners have made half of all monthly payments.

The first condition was set by the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, which established 78 percent loan-to-value ratio as the point where private mortgage insurance is no longer needed. To calculate the loan to value ratio of a mortgage, homeowners must divide the remaining loan balance by the original purchase price. For example, a family who purchased a $100,000 home will reach 78 percent LTV once the remaining balance falls below $78,000. This may take four to six years because most lenders front load interest in early mortgage payments.

The second condition is when homeowners have made half of the total amount of monthly payments. For example, a family who purchased a home through a 30-year mortgage loan will reach the halfway point after 15 years or 180 monthly payments. Once they reach the halfway point, lenders are required to cancel mortgage insurance regardless of loan-to-value ratio.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

The second way of removing private mortgage insurance is by requesting early cancellation. This option becomes available once the remaining mortgage balance is 80 percent of the original purchase price. If this is the case, homeowners can submit a cancellation request that must be addressed by lenders. It often takes up to six years to reach 20 percent equity due to front-loaded interest in mortgage payments. However, families can speed up the process by paying more each month or performing a new appraisal of the property.

Homeowners must meet certain requirements in order to request early cancellation. Most lenders would like to see a good payment history, no other liens on the property such as a second mortgage or home equity line of credit, and proof of value, which is often an appraisal or broker assessment. The proof of value must be paid by homeowners and can cost up to $500.

The third way of removing private mortgage insurance is by boosting property value through home improvements. This method is also useful when home prices are rising in the area. This is because higher property values can push loan-to-value ratio at or below 78 percent, triggering mortgage insurance cancellation. Refinancing the mortgage is also a way of getting rid of private mortgage insurance. However, families should make sure refinancing costs are not higher than the mortgage insurance payments they are trying to avoid.","Purchasing a home with low or no down payment may sound attractive.","2020-09-01 15:33:41",post,https://goodnesting.com/tell-the-bank-this-to-cut-all-future-mortgage-payments/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1184389591.jpg,shutterstock_1184389591.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1184389591.jpg,2864,shutterstock_1184389591,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1184389591.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,tell-the-bank-this-to-cut-all-future-mortgage-payments,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 15:54:56"
3329,"Try Before You Buy: How Rent-To-Own Home Programs Benefit You","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Let’s say you’re shopping for homes and find the perfect home, but the price is a little out of reach. Maybe putting 20 percent as a down payment or low credit scores prevent you from loan qualification.

Whichever the case, a rent-to-own program might allow you to secure the home of your dreams. We’ll explain how in this article.

<h3>What Is a Rent-To-Own Home?</h3>
Homes that are difficult to sell are sometimes listed as “rent to own.” Instead of buying the house then and there, an interested buyer has the option to lease now and purchase it later on.

In a rent-to-own situation, the seller agrees to sell the home at a specific price in one to three years, without putting it on the market. During this time, the prospective buyer will lease the house for an agreed-upon amount.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How Do Rent-To-Own Programs Work?</h3>
Typically, when a home is listed as rent-to-own, the seller will require an option fee at the beginning of the lease period. It is similar to a deposit. A standard option fee is around five percent of the purchase price of the home.

Should the interested buyer decide they do not want to purchase the home, the option fee is typically non-refundable. Some sellers will allow the option fee to go towards the purchase price or down payment of the house after the lease period is over.

During the lease period, monthly “rent” will be paid to the seller. The seller will not put the house on the market unless the buyer decides they do not want to purchase it.

The buyer may negotiate a rental credit, which puts a portion of the monthly rent paid towards the eventual purchase of the home. There is usually an option to buy before the end of the lease period as well.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

The home must be sold at the price contracted at the beginning of the lease. This is one of the main benefits of rent-to-own. You can secure a house now, and the price will not go up even if the market does.

<h3>How Much Does Rent-To-Own Cost?</h3>
As mentioned, the option fee is typically five percent of the home price, which can be negotiated with some sellers. If the home’s purchase price is $100,000, $5,000 will need to be put down as the deposit, which may serve as part of the down payment when the home is purchased.

If the monthly rent would typically be $1,000 per month, the seller may increase it to $1,200. The extra $200 per month could be used as a credit for purchasing the home. At the end of the three years, $7,200 will have already been paid towards the down payment or purchase.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h3>What If You Don’t Have Good Credit?</h3>
One of the main benefits of a rent to own program is the ability to build credit over the lease agreement so that you can qualify for the mortgage. Before entering a rent to own program, talk with a loan officer to see what you can realistically be eligible for in your timeline.

Sellers are more concerned with whether or not you can make the monthly payments. Since they are profiting monthly, can sell the house later on, and can keep your option fee, they are less affected if you decide you can’t afford the home.",,"2020-09-01 15:45:21",post,https://goodnesting.com/try-before-you-buy-how-rent-to-own-home-programs-benefit-you/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1023018748.jpg,shutterstock_1023018748.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1023018748.jpg,2858,shutterstock_1023018748,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1023018748.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,try-before-you-buy-how-rent-to-own-home-programs-benefit-you,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-02-19 18:22:45"
3331,"Inside The Habitat For Humanity Housing Application Process","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

For over 40 years, Habitat for Humanity has been building safe, affordable homes for over one million families. While the organization won’t give you a house for free, their application process is pretty straightforward.

What does the Habitat housing application process entail? We’ll take a look at those steps, but first, let’s take a look at what it takes to qualify for one of their homes in the first place.
<h3>Qualifications to Become a Habitat for Humanity Homeowner</h3>
Since Habitat for Humanity operates all around the world, each local office or affiliate has its own set of requirements for homeownership.

According to their main page, however, here’s what it takes to be considered an eligible Habitat homebuyer:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. You must be in need of better housing.</h4>
If you currently live in housing that is inadequate, damaged, unhealthy, or poorly built, you could pass the first test of the Habitat housing application process.

Other situations that show a need for better housing include having a disability and living in an inaccessible home. If a natural disaster damaged your home, that could indicate a need for better housing as well.
<h4>2. You must be willing to become a Habitat partner.</h4>
As mentioned, Habitat homes are not free. You will have to pay a mortgage on your home, although that payment will likely be low when compared to standard housing.

Although paying your mortgage on time is essential, Habitat places even more emphasis on its “sweat equity” principle.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

This entails helping to build your own home and the homes of others in the program or volunteering at a Habitat ReStore project where repairs are performed.

The amount of sweat equity hours you must put in varies according to your local affiliate. You can expect it to be in the hundreds, however. You may also have to take classes on home maintenance, personal finance, and other topics that can help you become a responsible homeowner.
<h4>3. You must be able to make timely payments on your mortgage.</h4>
To repeat what was said above, mortgages are a must on Habitat homes. Luckily, they are low since the costs to build such homes are smaller than typical housing.

Habitat takes mortgage payments and cycles them back into the community to build even more homes for other families.
<h4>4. You must meet specific financial requirements.</h4>
Your Habitat housing application will only be approved if you meet certain financial requirements from your local affiliate.

Showing a history of savings, even if it’s in small amounts, can help. Decent credit will be necessary too. Last but not least, your family’s income must meet a certain threshold for your area. It cannot be too high nor too low.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h3>How to Apply for a Habitat House</h3>
If you feel like you could be eligible for a Habitat house, call 1-800-HABITAT (1-800-422-4828) or go here to find your nearest affiliate.

Each affiliate has its own website that may list the actual income requirements, plus other information on how to get your Habitat housing application in motion.

The typical approval process includes the following:
<ol>
 	<li>Attending a local information session.</li>
 	<li>Setting up an appointment to complete your application.</li>
 	<li>Completing your application.</li>
 	<li>An in-home interview with a member of Habitat’s staff.</li>
 	<li>Getting approved.</li>
 	<li>Attending orientation.</li>
 	<li>Gathering your initial deposit (like a down payment on a regular home).</li>
 	<li>Starting your sweat equity.</li>

3333,"Get Low-Income Rental Assistance Via A Housing Choice Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Are you continuously struggling to make rent each month? Do you fear that you’ll eventually get evicted, leaving your family out in the street?

While your situation may be stressful now, the government can give you low-income rental assistance. Previously referred to as Section 8, Housing Choice Vouchers can help you pay the rent so you can stay afloat.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>How to Apply for a Housing Choice Voucher</h3>
<strong>Step 1: Find your local Public Housing Agency</strong>

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) distributes federal funds to local Public Housing Agencies (PHA). They then take those funds and use them to distribute vouchers to families in need.

You will be dealing with your PHA throughout the Housing Choice Voucher application process. To find the nearest PHA so you can learn more about available vouchers and start to apply, click here.

Contact your PHA to schedule an in-person appointment. During the call, you can tell them about your housing needs. They will tell you what to bring to the meeting.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<strong>Step 2: Complete the Housing Choice Voucher application</strong>

The housing counselor you interview with can help you fill out your voucher application.

When filling it out, it’s of extreme importance to be truthful. Omitting information is considered lying, and it can lead to your application getting rejected. Even if you think something may make you ineligible for a voucher, list it on the form to avoid any trouble.

Before your interview, your counselor will prep you on what to bring. Here are some bits of information (and documentation) you may have to submit:
<ul>
 	<li>Current income</li>
 	<li>Work history</li>
 	<li>Education or training</li>
 	<li>Assets</li>
 	<li>Details about people in your household</li>
 	<li>Criminal or eviction history</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<strong>Step 3: Wait for acceptance</strong>

If your application is accepted, you probably won’t receive low-income rental assistance right away. Instead, you’ll be put on a waiting list that could last months or years.

You can accelerate the process and spend less time on the waiting list if you:
<ul>
 	<li>Pay more than 50 percent of your income in rent.</li>
 	<li>Are homeless.</li>
 	<li>Are living in substandard conditions.</li>
</ul>
If your application is denied, your counselor will tell you why. You can then appeal the denial and turn it into approval.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<strong>Step 4: Find housing</strong>

Once you have a voucher and are no longer on the waiting list, you will have to find housing that meets HUD standards. An inspector from the PHA will visit the house in person to see that it’s acceptable.

You will have to sign a one-year lease on the HUD-approved property. After the first year is over, you can then move to a month-to-month agreement with the landlord.

Any voucher funds will be released directly to the landlord monthly. You will be expected to pay the rest of the rent on time.

Since this entire process can be lengthy, you should contact your PHA now to get the ball rolling.","When monthly bills become too much to bear, low-income rental assistance can save the day.

You may not need a new home from Habitat for Humanity. Your existing home may need some improvements, however.

Does Habitat for Humanity help repair existing homes? You bet they do, and they may even help you improve the exterior of your home cosmetically too.

While the home preservation programs may differ according to location, we’ll take a look at a couple of examples from Palm Beach County, Florida, in this article to give you an idea of what’s out there.

At the end, we’ll include a link so that you can find your nearest Habitat for Humanity to see which similar programs they have available.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Habitat for Humanity’s Critical Home Repair Program</h3>
Home repairs can be extremely costly. If your family’s income is low and you can barely pay your bills, you may not have the resources to get the repairs you need.

Are all repairs created equal? No, as some are more cosmetic while others can be necessities due to safety concerns. To address the latter, the Critical Home Repair program can help fix your home in Palm Beach County by offering up to $10,000 in funding.

If you need accessibility improvements to your home, Critical Home Repair can provide what’s required so you can move around with ease. 

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

And if you have serious code violations or safety issues that are putting your family at risk, the program can lend a helping hand there too.

To qualify for this home repair program, you must own and occupy the home. Your income must be less than 80 percent of the median income in your area. You must also provide eight hours of “sweat equity” to help with the actual repairs, depending on the work.

Is the Critical Home Repair Program free? No, as you’ll be expected to pay back the money based on your income and other factors.

Critical Home Repair is not considered to be an emergency program. Applications are accepted every quarter in January, April, July, and October. There will also be a waiting period before the repairs can begin.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>A Brush With Kindness</h3>
Could your home need an exterior facelift? Having one could make it more pleasant to live in, and it could boost its value should you want to sell it eventually. With Habitat for Humanity’s A Brush with Kindness program, you can achieve this goal.

Should you qualify for the program, you could get up to $5,000 to cosmetically improve your home’s exterior. Qualifications for this program are similar to those for Critical Home Repair, as is the quarterly application schedule. Contact your local office, and they should be able to point you in the right direction.","Habitat for Humanity isn’t just about building brand new homes for low-income families.

3337,"A Quick Habitat For Humanity Housing Q&A","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

One of the best ways to achieve that goal is through affordable housing, which Habitat for Humanity can provide. We’ll give you a quick background of this program so you can see if applying for Habitat for Humanity housing is right for you.
<h4>Why was Habitat for Humanity created?</h4>
The main goal behind Habitat for Humanity is to give everyone a chance to have a decent home to live in. To achieve this, the nonprofit organization has set up offices in over 70 countries and throughout the United States.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How does Habitat for Humanity function?</h4>
The organization gets donations from corporations, communities of faith, and individuals. These donations fund construction projects that are completed by a combination of volunteers from the local community, plus experts who are there to guide them to ensure that the homes are built properly.
<h4>Does Habitat for Humanity only build new homes?</h4>
While Habitat for Humanity is best-known for building new homes with the help of the community volunteers, the program also has “ReStores.”

These stores take donations of hardware and appliances and sell them for a fraction of the cost. Profits go towards the funding of Habitat’s homeownership programs.

In addition, Habitat also repairs existing homes. In some areas, the program may offer as much as $10,000 to a qualifying homeowner, so they can make critical home repairs to increase safety and accessibility.

Lastly, some homeowners can take advantage of Habitat’s cosmetic improvement programs. If you qualify, you could get $5,000, for example, to improve the exterior of your home, which can help you when it comes time to sell.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Are Habitat for Humanity homes free?</h4>
Despite what many may think of the program, Habitat for Humanity homes are not free. Instead, homeowners will be expected to pay a monthly mortgage, just as with any regular house.
<h4>What does Habitat for Humanity look for in a potential homeowner?</h4>
There are three essential criteria that the organization looks at when determining eligibility.

First, they must find that you require safer and more affordable housing. Second, they must see that you have the ability/income to pay an affordable mortgage. Lastly, you must be able to pay any associated closing costs with the home, plus a willingness to perform sweat equity.
<h4>What is sweat equity, and can you skip it?</h4>
Sweat equity can be seen as hard work put towards a project. For families with lower income, they can use sweat equity to replace the money they may not have to pay for a home.

In short, it gives them a foot in the door to finally achieve the dream of being a homeowner.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

When dealing with Habitat for Humanity, sweat equity can come in various forms, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Doing construction work.</li>
 	<li>Cleaning building sites.</li>
 	<li>Doing administrative duties.</li>
 	<li>Working in a Habitat ReStore.</li>
</ul>
Beyond those duties, your children can contribute towards sweat equity with good grades in school. You will also be asked to take classes on topics like credit repair, insurance, mortgages, and maintenance that can help you become a more responsible and informed homeowner.

What’s your main priority as a single parent? Most likely, it’s your kids. You want to ensure they have a roof over their head and live in a clean, safe home. You also want to ensure that their nutrition is up to snuff, and they get all the meals they need.

With rising costs, achieving these goals can become increasingly difficult. How might you choose to achieve them? By working longer hours, seeking side income, or trying to work two jobs. Can such moves help you keep food on the table? Sure, but they’ll take time away from your kids, and they could cause your child care costs to skyrocket.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the best move as it relates to food for a single parent? Find food assistance through one of these options:
<h4>For Emergencies, Call the National Hunger Hotline or 211</h4>
If you don’t know where your next meal will come from and your kids are hungry, calling the National Hunger Hotline may be your best bet. Many see it as a form of emergency food assistance, as it can put you in touch with resources close to you to find help quickly.

Call 866-3-HUNGRY between 7 am and 10 pm, Monday through Friday, and someone from the hotline will help you get food fast.

211 is similar to the National Hunger Hotline, as it’s a number you can call to get direction on where to look for food when your family is hungry. 211 can help you find local food distribution sites, or put you in touch with a nearby community or religious organization that offers nutritional aid to those in need.

Does 211 only offer food assistance? No, as they are somewhat of a one-stop-shop for several needs, such as housing, healthcare, and other essential needs.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>WIC</h4>
If you’re pregnant or just had a child, nutrition is crucial. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, can help you get the specific food to suit your needs.

It may not be emergency food assistance, but if you’ve been having trouble regularly feeding yourself and your kids, you’ll want to apply for WIC for stability in the near future.
<h4>SNAP</h4>
Like WIC, SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program isn’t emergency food assistance that’ll help feed you today. You’ll have to apply for benefits, but if you qualify, you can get the funds you need to feed your kids regularly.

You can apply for SNAP by going here.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Summer Food Service Program</h4>
Your kids’ nutrition may suffer when school is not in session. To avoid this, you can contact the Summer Food Service Program that offers meals and snacks to kids while on vacation.

Food stamps are no stranger to the public, as most people have heard of them before. While many people still use the food stamps moniker, the more formal name for this government benefit is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Food stamps can come with a stigma due to past beliefs on the program. Now, however, SNAP is common. Many families use it to get back on their feet and ensure their children stay fed.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

You can do the same, as there’s no need to worry about what others might think of you using this assistance. Best of all, they’ve changed how food stamps function, as you can now get a card you can swipe to pay for your groceries.
<h4>SNAP’s Primary Function</h4>
As you can tell by its name, SNAP aims to supplement the nutrition of those in need. Although it may not intend to buy all of your food, you can get some sizable benefits to make grocery purchases that grow with the number of people in your household. For instance, a family of four could get a maximum benefit of $646, which could ease your food worries quickly.

The “nutrition” part of SNAP’s name is essential, as you will have certain restrictions when making purchases. Things that are considered luxuries, such as hot or prepared foods, supplements, vitamins, tobacco, or alcohol cannot be bought with SNAP benefits. You can, however, buy foods to fill your fridge and cupboard, such as poultry, meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, dairy, snacks, non-alcoholic drinks, and so on.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->
<h4>How To Receive SNAP Benefits</h4>
SNAP was created to help low-income families with food. Keeping this in mind, you will have to pass specific requirements for this food assistance program. One of the most essential requirements deals with income.

Your household’s gross and net income will be checked to ensure they fall within the program’s limits. If you fear your family earns too much money to qualify, know that you can deduct expenses to lower your income, such as housing costs, childcare costs, and more. If anyone in your household receives SSI or TANF benefits, that could help you qualify automatically.

Beyond income, your resources will also be looked at. A resource is often considered cash or bank accounts, instead of your home and your first car. If anyone receives SSI or TANF, this resource calculation can be bypassed.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Once income and resources are considered, you will also have to pass the test of either having a Social Security number or applying for one in the past. This applies to all household members.

Lastly, you may have to meet work requirements to get SNAP, especially for anyone between the ages of 18-49.

Since requirements may change according to location, your best bet is to contact your local SNAP office now and ask any questions you may have. Then you can begin the application process.","Want to avoid any worries about feeding your family?

3356,"Avoid Student Loans By Getting Free College Grants","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

For many, there’s one big thing standing between them and their dream of getting a college degree. It’s not so much the time investment required to study and attend classes. Instead, it’s thousands of dollars of debt that are scaring potential college students away.

After all, who wants to complete college and begin their professional career, only to have to worry about how they’ll fit student loan payments into their budget? Could working for a while and saving to finance your education avoid this issue? Sure, but that could take a long time until you get enough money saved up for tuition and other expenses. Plus, there’s an even better option to find funding.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Grants Versus Student Loans and Scholarships</h4>
A college grant can help pay for your education just like a student loan can. Unlike a loan, though, you do not have to pay a grant back. In other words, getting a grant means you’re basically receiving free money so you can avoid going into the deep debt that saddles many graduates.

Beyond the fact that grants are free money and won’t cost you an arm and a leg like student loans will, they also have an advantage over scholarships. While a scholarship is another form of free money you can use to fund your education, grants may be easier to qualify for and receive. This is because grants are usually based on need, such as having a low income.

Scholarships, on the other hand, tend to take merit into account, along with need. With merit being part of the equation, you may need a stronger resume to get a scholarship. For instance, you may be up against other students gunning for that same scholarship with excellent grades, loads of extracurricular activities on their profile, etc. Apply for a grant that mostly looks at need and factors such as income, and you may have an easier time winning it.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Where To Look for College Grants</h4>
Now that you see why getting a grant for college is so advantageous over other forms of educational funding, let’s discuss where to find this free money.

Your best bet is to start with the federal government to widen your options. To do this, you want to allow universities to see where you stand when it comes to need, which can be achieved by filling out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA form.

With that out of the way, you can start seeing which grants are at your disposal, as any colleges you’re accepted to will begin sending you letters. For instance, you may be notified that you qualify for Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, etc.

Keep an eye out for such financial aid letters, as you’ll want to respond as soon as you get them in the mail since grants are limited.

To find college grants from your state, go <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and contact the agency that corresponds to where you live.

Beyond federal and state college grants, you may also have luck dealing directly with colleges. To see what grants your college has to offer, get in touch with their financial aid office.","Are you avoiding college because of student debt?

3359,"6 Types Of College Grants You Should Know About","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Before you start searching for some, here’s a quick look at the different types of college grants you’ll come across.

The list of college grants is quite long. If you’ve never looked for this form of free money before, the sheer number of opportunities can be overwhelming. That’s why it’s best to break down your grant search according to category.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are the main types you’ll be dealing with during your research:
<h4>1. Federal Grants</h4>
These grants come from the U.S. Department of Education and are tough to beat. When beginning your grant search, it’s best to start at the top with the broadest category, which is federal.

Some examples of popular federal grants include:
<ul>
 	<li>Pell Grant – Based on financial need, this grant is attainable by anyone on their way to college. You’ll need to complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA form to apply for it.</li>
 	<li>Academic Competitiveness Grant – You’ll have to qualify for the Pell Grant first to be eligible here. The grant is both merit and need-based, and can offer $750 for first-year students and $1,300 for sophomores.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. State-Sponsored Grants</h4>
After your federal grant search is exhausted, it’s time to move to the state level. These grants usually require you to be a resident of the state to qualify. Like federal and other grants, they can be need or both merit and need-based.

To find what grants your state has to offer, go <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/state/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a> and select it from the map.
<h4>3. College-Specific Grants</h4>
With your federal and state grant search complete, now’s the time to move towards grants offered from specific colleges themselves. Why would a college offer grants of its own? To attract students to enroll. As with other grants, the ones you’ll find here can be based on merit or need. Your opportunities may also depend on your course of study.

The financial aid office of the college you’re interested in will have more information on the grants they have to offer.
<h4>4. Grants for Specific Careers and Course Studies</h4>
Universities, professional associations, and private and public endowments sponsor grants for students looking to pursue a specific career. For instance, Future Farmers of America offers over $2 million per year in grants and scholarships to students looking to get a degree in agriculture.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>5. Grants for Student Types</h4>
The amount of available grants grows even wider once you start searching for free money offered to certain students. For example, you can search for college grants for:
<ul>
 	<li>Minorities</li>
 	<li>Women</li>
 	<li>Disabled students</li>
 	<li>Students with medical conditions like diabetes or breast cancer</li>
 	<li>Single parents</li>
 	<li>Adult students returning to college after several years</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Unique Grants</h4>
Last but not least, there are even more grants given out for unique reasons such as:
<ul>
 	<li>The Truman Library Institute Research Grants – Given to grad students researching the former president.</li>
 	<li>The Endangered Language Fund – Given to those who study ancient languages.</li>

3362,"Can A Federal Grant Fund Your College Or Career?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Is going to college or a career school expensive? In many cases, yes. Should this keep you from pursuing that dream? Of course not, as there are several ways to help finance your education, with federal grants being one of the very best.
<h4>What Is a Federal Grant?</h4>
A grant can come from various sources, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Federal government</li>
 	<li>States</li>
 	<li>Colleges</li>
 	<li>Career schools</li>
 	<li>Private organizations</li>
 	<li>Nonprofits</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

In the case of education, a grant is a financial award that can reduce tuition costs and other expenses associated with going to college or a career school. Best of all, you do not have to pay the money back as long as you follow specific rules, making grants a much more attractive option than student loans.

With federal grants, awards come from the U.S. Department of Education. Perhaps the most popular option is the Federal Pell Grant, which goes to undergraduate students that display a financial need. Another government grant for undergrads that’s need-based is the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant. Financial aid offices administer it at participating schools.

As you’ll find when generally searching for college grants, some are tied to specific fields of study and careers. As far as federal grants go, one example of this is the TEACH Grant. You’ll need to take certain classes to receive the funding and fulfill obligations as a teacher to ensure you don’t have to pay the money back.

Other grants, meanwhile, may be tied to things beyond financial need or your field of study. Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants are an example of this, as they are awarded to children of parents or guardians who died in either conflict.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Eligibility for Federal Grants</h4>
Where does one determine their financial need so they can qualify for federal grants? By filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form (FAFSA).

Once complete, schools will be able to see where you stand in terms of financial need, and this will affect whether or not you receive certain grants.

You’ll have to complete a FAFSA form during each year of your studies to continue receiving aid. While this may seem tedious, the financial rewards make it well worth your time.

Once eligible for a grant, you will have to follow specific rules to keep the money without repayment. These differ according to the grant. If you do not follow those rules, you may have to pay the money back. Examples where this would be the case include:
<ul>
 	<li>Switching enrollment status from full-time to a part-time student.</li>
 	<li>Receiving other scholarships that reduce your financial need.</li>
 	<li>Withdrawing from a program you received the grant for.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

If repayment is necessary, you will usually have 45 days to pay the grant back. If you cannot pay it in full, you can work out a repayment arrangement. Fulfilling the agreement is a must if you hope to receive other forms of federal student aid in the future.","Is a lack of cash holding you back from advancing your education or taking your career to new heights?

And thanks to the Internet, you can begin your search without having to leave your couch's comfort.","If you think no college grants exist to fund your education, think again.","2021-06-24 17:21:13",post,https://goodnesting.com/do-you-qualify-for-any-of-these-unique-college-grants/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_115335826.jpg,shutterstock_115335826.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_115335826.jpg,3368,shutterstock_115335826,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_115335826.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Work From Home",Education,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,do-you-qualify-for-any-of-these-unique-college-grants,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-22 13:30:59"
3370,"How To Get $6,000 (And More) For School From The Federal Government","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

When you decide to start studying to get a degree, you probably focus on two things. First, you want to make sure you keep your grades up so you can graduate on time. And second, you have to figure out how to pay for it all.

Depending on your financial situation, that second item may be your biggest concern. Getting a degree can be quite expensive, which is why student loans exist. But instead of borrowing money you’ll have to pay back at a later date (plus interest), why not get some free funding instead?

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

You can do so via student grants from the federal government, some of which can give you over $6,000 per year to finance your studies. And as for being “free,” that’s because grants, unlike loans, do not have to be paid back.
<h3>How To Get Federal Student Grants</h3>
Before we jump into the federal student grant application process, remember that there are many other free money sources for college. Once you exhaust the federal option, begin looking for grants from your state and school. You should also search for assistance from nonprofits and private organizations, plus funding available according to your field of study, status as a minority, disability, etc.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

In short, don’t let your grant search come up short. Doing so could lead to you leaving a lot of money on the table.

With that out of the way, here’s what you must do to get the federal grants we’re about to discuss: Complete your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Doing so puts you in consideration for assistance from schools you are interested in. You will have to complete this form yearly to continue receiving financial aid.
<h3>Federal Student Grant Examples</h3>
To give you an idea of the type of funding out there, here’s a look at the top four college grants from the federal government:
<h4>Pell Grant</h4>
Fill out your FAFSA form to show you have financial need, and you could receive up to $6,345 per year with a Pell Grant. This popular college grant is meant for undergraduate students, so you may be out of luck if you have a degree already.

A Pell Grant can give you cash for college for up to 12 semesters.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->
<h4>Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant</h4>
Here’s a grant that shows you just how specific some awards can be. If a parent or guardian passed while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan after the events of 9/11, you could receive $5,829.50 from this grant.
<h4>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</h4>
If you need an extra nudge to fill out your FAFSA form now, here it is: Qualifying for the Pell Grant gives you priority with the FSEOG and its max funding of $4,000 per year. Combine that with the monies from the Pell Grant, and you could get a ton of help financing your education from just filling out a form.
<h4>Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant (TEACH)</h4>
If you’re looking to become a teacher, this federal grant can give you up to $3,764.","If you need cash for college, the first place you should look is with the federal government.

3374,"How To Apply For Federal Student Grants, Loans, And Work-Study Programs","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here’s how to get financial aid from the government so you can start studying now.

Where’s the first place you should look for financial aid for school? The federal government, as it can give you help via:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Grants – Awards based on financial need that do not need to be repaid.</li>
 	<li>Student loans – Money you borrow that you’ll have to repay with interest.</li>
 	<li>Work-study programs – Money you earn by working a job as a student.</li>
</ul>
What’s the best form of aid of that bunch? It’s obviously grants since you don’t have to pay them back nor invest your time to reap their monetary rewards. But even student loans and work-study jobs are helpful since they keep you from having to fork over cash upfront to pay for tuition and other expenses.

How do you get the ball rolling for these forms of federal student aid? Here’s the application process in a nutshell.
<h4>Before You Apply</h4>
As is the case when applying for anything, you’ll need to provide information about your situation when applying for federal student aid. Financial need plays a huge part in determining what help you qualify for, so start gathering documents like bank statements and W-2s.

Beyond that, you’ll need basic information like your Social Security number or Alien Registration number if you are not a citizen.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How to Apply</h4>
You might as well get familiar with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form right now. Why? Because it’s what you’ll need to fill out now and in the future to receive financial aid for the government.

What’s FAFSA’s primary purpose? To determine your financial need, which is why you’ll need to have your bank statements and W-2s handy to complete it.

Once your financial need level is determined, the government can figure out if you qualify for aid. This can then help the school you’re looking to attend send you support offers that’ll help reduce your college costs.

You’ll want to double-check your FAFSA form as you fill it out to ensure everything is correct. You’ll have a chance to do this again via your Student Aid Report that will be sent to you in the mail or electronically. Correct any errors you find and submit the report quickly so you can complete the application process.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>What Comes Next</h4>
Hopefully, you’ll receive several financial aid offers from your school. Don’t just accept everything you’re offered, though, as some assistance forms are better than others.

Any grants are great since they’re free money. Remember that work-study involves a time commitment. Lastly, look over the terms of any student loans if you’re wary about going into debt after graduating. Loans should be accepted last since they do come with a financial cost.
<h4>Keeping Your Financial Aid</h4>
It’s important to remember that federal student aid is tied to your FAFSA form. As such, you’ll need to complete it every year to continue receiving benefits.","There’s no need to pay for college or career school on your own.","2021-06-21 18:19:03",post,https://goodnesting.com/how-to-apply-for-federal-student-grants-loans-and-work-study-programs/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_104969219.jpg,shutterstock_104969219.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_104969219.jpg,3375,shutterstock_104969219,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_104969219.jpg,,,,,,,,,"Work From Home",Education,publish,2,Good,cjpatrick@gmail.com,Good,Nesting,how-to-apply-for-federal-student-grants-loans-and-work-study-programs,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-22 13:32:06"
3389,"Boost Your Holiday Budget By Reducing These Monthly Costs","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you feel bad right now because money’s tight, don’t be. The coronavirus took a big bite out of many people’s budgets via lost jobs and income, so you're certainly not alone.

Of course, the fact that the holiday season is lurking around the corner doesn’t help, as you’re probably wondering how you’ll buy all of those gifts. And while saving in 2020 and playing it safe is a good strategy, here are some ways to cut costs so you can at least splurge a little in the months to come.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Cable</h4>
You probably have a lot more cable channels in your TV lineup than you actually watch. The question is, would you really miss them if they were gone?

You probably wouldn’t. And when you consider that the average household has a cable bill over $100, it becomes pretty evident that cutting the cord can give you a good amount of additional cash for the holidays.

At the very least, call up your cable company and tell them you want to cancel. Most will give you an immediate discount to keep you as a customer.
<h4>Eating out</h4>
How many times per month do you eat out? Whether it’s at a restaurant, drive-thru, or even prepared food from the grocery store, those food costs can add up.

If you genuinely want to build your holiday budget, cutting dining expenses is a great way to do so. You’ll save significant cash by buying groceries and cooking them at home, and your body will thank you for it too.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Brand Names</h4>
There are certain items where opting for the best brand name makes sense, such as a car or a home appliance. Other times, however, you can save money by going generic.

Just look at your grocery store. In most, you’ll find the generic option right next to that expensive brand name, at a much lower price.

Try taking the generic route for at least a month and use those savings towards your holiday fund.
<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
Meat delivery, movies, TV shows, music, audiobooks, news – what do they all have in common? They’re just a few examples of things offered by subscription services nowadays.

If you’re a member of many, try cutting back for these last months of 2020. The savings can add up, and you probably won’t see a massive dip in your lifestyle. Then use those savings to buy end-of-year gifts without having to whip out your credit card.
<h4>Utilities</h4>
Think about how you use electricity and water. Have you done your best to conserve them? If not, now’s a good time to start, as reducing utility costs can boost your bank account.

Turn down that AC. Unplug electronics when they’re not actively used. Use a programmable thermostat. Time yourself in the shower. Opt for cold over hot water. Tiny moves like those can lead to significant savings.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Gym</h4>
Unless you’re a workout warrior, you may want to put any gym memberships on pause. Take walks around the neighborhood or use YouTube workout videos as free replacements, so you stay fit despite holiday food.
<h4>Cell Phone</h4>
Are you paying too much for your cell phone service? You probably are, which is why you should shop around and see what all the competitors in your area have to offer.

There’s no need to pick one of the biggest names, either. Many smaller providers can provide the same service at much lower costs.","How can you make sure you have enough money for holiday gifts?

After a long, excruciating year, the 2020 election is nearly here. It was set to be a tough showdown on its own, but the COVID-19 pandemic has ratcheted up the intensity several notches.

There are several hot topics on the campaign trail, such as race, immigration, taxes, and healthcare, with housing seeming to take a back seat to the rest. That doesn’t mean it’s not essential, though, as many are looking to see how housing will change if Trump continues or Biden takes his place.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

To help you differentiate the two candidates based on housing, here is what each camp has to offer:
<h4>President Donald Trump</h4>
Unlike his challenger, President Trump has not expressed any specific housing proposals for the future. However, he is running on his record during his first term, and here are some of the highlights.
<ul>
 	<li>Wants the government to have a limited role in housing finance and regulation.</li>
 	<li>Hopes to end the government’s control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by 2024, making them privately owned instead.</li>
 	<li>If Trump gets his wish and privatizes both agencies, the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage could see borrowers paying higher interest rates on their mortgages.</li>
 	<li>Ended Obama’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation in July 2020, which addressed housing discrimination in certain communities.</li>
 	<li>y ending AFHH, low and middle-income families could have trouble finding affordable housing.</li>
 	<li>Created “opportunity zones” in 2017 via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to trigger investment and development in more impoverished communities.</li>
 	<li>With TCJA’s opportunity zones, the hope is to make affordable housing more available while also boosting employment.</li>
 	<li>In 2018, removed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) ability to oversee the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, which went after lenders for discrimination.</li>
 	<li>In response to COVID-19, signed an executive order in 2020 to potentially ban residential evictions during the pandemic. He also directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to help people who could not afford to pay their rent/mortgage due to the coronavirus.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Former Vice President Joe Biden</h4>
While President Trump is running more on his record, Joe Biden has laid out several plans for housing, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>A 10-year, $640 billion investment to make affordable, safe, stable, healthy, and energy-efficient housing more accessible to every American.</li>
 	<li>A $15,000 tax credit to help first-time homebuyers who lack the money for a down payment to purchase a home. The tax credit would be available when buying the house, so there are no out-of-pocket costs.</li>
 	<li>Teachers, first responders, and other service workers could pay less for homes and get down payment assistance.</li>
 	<li>Create a new Homeowner and Renter Bill of Rights to tackle the problem of high-cost loans, premature foreclosures, and more.</li>
 	<li>Address racial gaps in credit scoring by having reporting agencies consider additional factors like utility bills and rent payments made on time.</li>
 	<li>Reinstate the AFFH that was eliminated by President Trump.</li>
 	<li>Invest an additional $100 billion in affordable housing to build new properties or upgrade existing ones.</li>
 	<li>Increase the energy efficiency of homes via a $10 billion investment.</li>
 	<li>Expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit budget by $2 billion.</li>
 	<li>Expand access to affordable homes in rural communities via USDA programs.</li>
 	<li>Invest $13 billion over five years to tackle homelessness via housing, job training, healthcare, addiction assistance, etc.</li>
 	<li>Create housing options for formerly incarcerated people once they are released from prison.</li>

As you think of necessities in life, things like food and shelter probably come to mind. But while overlooked, this might be even more important: Healthcare.

If you need proof of how important healthcare is, think of 2020 and all it brought in terms of the pandemic. Without proper health, the need for food and shelter goes out the window, which is why participating in the Medicare Open Enrollment Period (OEP) is essential.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Although you’ve probably heard of this period from one source or another, you may be wondering what open enrollment is and how it works. Keep reading, and we’ll help you achieve that goal.
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions on Medicare Open Enrollment</h3>
<h4>1. What’s the purpose of Medicare Open Enrollment?</h4>
The OEP was instituted to give Medicare users the option to ensure their plans fit their needs every year.
<h4>2. When is the OEP?</h4>
The 2020 OEP began on October 15. It will finish on December 7. In other words, if you haven’t taken advantage of it yet, now is the time to do so before you miss out.
<h4>3. What can you do during Medicare Open Enrollment?</h4>
While the OEP won’t let you do everything under the sun as it pertains to Medicare, it still leaves you with several options, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Optimize your drug coverage by switching your current Medicare Part D plan, adding or dropping Part D if you have Parts A or B, etc.</li>
 	<li>Switching between Original Medicare Parts A and B and Medicare Advantage, or vice versa.</li>
 	<li>Switching your Medicare Advantage Plan to a different one.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>4. How can you tell if you need to change your current Medicare plans?</h4>
You may not need to make any changes to your Medicare plans, or 2020 may be the perfect time to do so.
How can you tell? By reviewing your Annual Notice of Change or ANOC. It comes in the mail and gives you a breakdown of any changes to your plan for 2021.

Reviewing your ANOC is an essential part of the OEP process, as it will tell you exactly where your current plans may not fit your needs in the coming year.
<h4>5. How can Medicare plans change from year to year?</h4>
Here are just some of the changes that may appear in your ANOC, which could prompt the need for something new that better fits your healthcare needs and budget:
<ul>
 	<li>Changes in drug coverage.</li>
 	<li>Higher costs for prescriptions and services.</li>

If so, we’ll show you how to find those funds so you can start building your future without worry.

For many, a lack of desire isn’t preventing them from going to school to further their education. Instead, it’s a lack of money.

Going to a trade school or college can be expensive even if you work a full-time job, but that’s no reason to delay your dream or skip it altogether.

There are many ways to get funding for school. Some of them you won’t even have to pay back. Where can you find these resources? By going through these easy-to-read guides:
<h4>Can A Federal Grant Fund Your College Or Career?</h4>
When it comes to money for school, it’s hard to beat the federal government. If you can get a grant from them, that’s free money for your studies that you will never have to pay back, unlike a loan.

Of course, the term “federal grant” may seem a bit intimidating if you’ve never applied for one before, which is why this article is essential reading if you’re seeking free education funding: <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/can-a-federal-grant-fund-your-college-or-career/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Can A Federal Grant Fund Your College Or Career?</a>

Many organizations offer grants for specific types of students.

If your current income isn’t cutting it and you can barely pay your bills, you’ll need to come up with ways to increase it. While making deliveries is a hot side gig right now, so are renting out space in your home or your car to other people.

Should you rent out a room or your car to give your income that much-needed boost? Or are these side gigs more trouble than they’re worth? Let’s take a look at that right now so you can see if they deserve a spot on your to-do list.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Renting One of Your Rooms Through Airbnb</h4>
A spare room in your home could be an easy avenue for extra cash if you rent it out on a site like Airbnb. You simply take some pictures of the room, list it for a price per night, and hope travelers or people needing a short-term rental take you up on your offer.

The main advantage of listing a room on Airbnb is that it can offer passive income. In other words, it’s not like a regular job where you’ll have to work every hour to make money. As long as you help the customer check-in and clean up after them before the next person comes in, you should be good to go.

If you’re worried about things like accidents, know that Airbnb covers your rental with $1 million in insurance to calm that fear.

What are the disadvantages of renting out a room on Airbnb? For one, the company will charge you a 3 percent fee per booking. Depending on where you live, there may be a lot of competition, which could cause you to rent out the room at a lower price than you’d like. Lastly, you may not like the fact that strangers are staying in the same house. And you may run into occasional troublemakers that don’t respect your property.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

However, if you have trouble paying the rent, Airbnb can be a solid option as a second source of income. At the very worst, if you don’t like it, you can remove your listing and try something else to earn extra cash.
<h4>Rent Out Your Car Through Getaround or Turo</h4>
Airbnb became so popular that people decided to replicate the idea with cars via sites like Getaround and Turo. Like Airbnb, this is a passive income stream that works well if you have an extra car or barely drive. You can pick when you want to rent your car, and all you have to do is drop it off to the customer when they need it.

Both Getaround and Turo offer insurance on top of your car’s policy, so you’re covered there. As for the major disadvantages, they begin with commission fees.

Getaround charges a 40 percent commission on rentals. Turo can take up to 35 percent. That can seem like a lot, especially when it’s your car that’s getting mileage and wear and tear put on it. Speaking of, interior damage may not be covered when renting out your car. If this is an issue, you may want to stay away.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

In the end, renting out your car may be a viable option for extra income if you’re really struggling right now. It won’t make you rich, but it could help you pay about $200 extra in monthly bills for very little work.","Two popular ways to boost income include renting out a spare room or even your car.

3427,"If You’re Not Doing This When Shopping Online, You’re Paying Too Much","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Many people seem to think that just because they buy something online, that they must be getting the best deal. Is it true that online shopping can be more friendly to your bank account than brick and mortar stores? Yes, but that doesn’t mean automatic savings, as you still need to shop around and do other things to ensure you get the best price.

What might you be missing out on that could lead to extra savings down the line? These easy-to-follow practices that’ll keep more cash in your pocket:

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Leveraging the Power of Money-Saving Apps</h4>
What’s the “old fashioned” way of finding deals? Clipping coupons out of a newspaper or going to stores when they have sales. What’s a better way to get deals, especially when doing it online? Using apps, websites, and browser extensions that can help you save in more ways than one.

Let’s say you want to comparison shop, for example, so you can see which retailer has the best online price. You could do that via a search, or you could use an app like Capital One Shopping to do all of the dirty work for you.

What about coupon codes? If you aren’t searching for them, you’re leaving money on the table, as most retailers have such promos to entice sales. You could use a site like CouponFollow to search for coupon codes with ease, or you could use the Honey app to automatically search for and apply the codes for you at checkout.

These are just a few examples of apps that do everything they can to help you save, so don’t forget to use them to your advantage.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Avoiding Shipping Costs</h4>
Are you always paying around $10 or more to have items shipped to you? There’s no need to, as many sites offer free shipping if you:
<ul>
 	<li>Have their credit card.</li>
 	<li>Are a member of their text or email list.</li>
 	<li>Buy a certain amount of products.</li>
 	<li>Find free shipping promo codes.</li>
</ul>
Start cutting your online shipping costs now, and the savings will add up over time.
<h4>Getting the Inside Scoop on Deals</h4>
Have you ever wondered why someone would want texts or emails from an online retailer? It’s not because they like to be annoyed. Instead, signing up for such notifications often leads to inside discounts that many people don’t know exist.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Using Social Media</h4>
You may use social media to stay in touch with friends and family or for entertainment. However, if you haven’t used it to search for online savings, you could be missing out.

Start following your favorite brands on social media, and throw in some influencers that may like the same things you do. They’ll release promo codes that you can use to score some easy online savings from time to time.

If you don’t like the idea of following brands or influencers, you may not even have to. A quick visit to their profiles can yield some coupon codes you can use without the need for a follow, provided they aren’t set to private.","Are you paying too much for your Internet purchases?

3432,"3 Ways To Find Affordable Rentals Through The Government","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

It can seem like a major struggle to simply keep a roof over your head if your rent is high. Even if you have a full-time job and avoid unnecessary expenses, your rent may take such a huge portion of your income that you have nothing left over for savings, emergency funds, and other expenses.

What’s the best way to fix this issue? Beyond getting another job or moving to somewhere cheaper and less desirable, your best bet is to get help from the government.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Let’s take a look at three government housing programs that can make your rent much more affordable, so you have more financial freedom.
<h4>1. Section 8</h4>
When it comes to government housing assistance programs, this one may be the most popular of the bunch. Qualify for Section 8, and you’ll only have to pay a small portion of your monthly income towards the rent.

Who pays the rest? The government does, with a voucher that gets sent directly to your landlord every month.

Contrary to popular belief, Section 8 housing doesn’t require that you live in some rundown government building. Instead, you get to pick between an apartment, townhome, and single-family home when using a voucher.

You can kickstart the Section 8 application process by <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">getting in touch with your Public Housing Agency (PHA)</a>. Before you do, know that you’ll have to meet income and citizenship requirements, plus more.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Public Housing</h4>
Although its eligibility requirements mirror those of Section 8 vouchers, public housing provides a bit less leeway in terms of where you live. You can still pick between apartments, townhomes, or single-family homes, but your landlord will be the PHA instead of a private owner.

As with a regular rental agreement, your PHA will want to ensure that you’ll make a good tenant before accepting you into public housing. To achieve this goal, they will contact your past landlords to see that you’re trustworthy.

You can start applying for public housing by <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contacting your PHA</a>.
<h4>3. Privately-Owned Subsidized Housing</h4>
As you can tell by its name, this option will have you renting under a landlord who privately owns the property. Why would a landlord want to participate in this program? Because they get money from the government to make rent more affordable.

While you deal extensively with a PHA in Section 8 and public housing, you’ll need to apply to the rental management office directly when using this option.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

In terms of eligibility, your income will need to sit below a certain limit to qualify for privately-owned subsidized housing. The landlord will also have their own requirements you’ll need to meet before you’re handed over the keys.

There’s a handy tool to help you find subsidized housing near you. It comes from a trusty source in the U.S. government, and you can find it <a href=""https://apps.hud.gov/apps/section8/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.","Are you sick of barely getting by because your rent is too high?

3436,"How To Convert Your Unwanted Stuff Into Cash Online","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Why? Because you can sell your unwanted stuff instead, and we’ll offer some tips on how to get it done.

When the bills pile up, and income is low, many people begin to stress over the thought of having to get a second job to make ends meet. And while that could help you fix your finances, you may not need to get another job if you have enough stuff to sell in your home.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

You can kill two birds with one stone by selling your unwanted stuff. First, you’ll declutter your home and make it more organized. And second, you’ll get some cash once other people take that stuff off of your hands.

If you don’t think you have anything to sell, here’s a quick list to help you brainstorm. Chances are, you have some of these items in your home right now:
<ul>
 	<li>A second car or vehicle, like a scooter or motorcycle</li>
 	<li>Electronics</li>
 	<li>Jewelry you never wear</li>
 	<li>Old clothes</li>
 	<li>Outdated furniture</li>
 	<li>Outdoor equipment</li>
 	<li>Sporting goods and gym equipment</li>
 	<li>Tools</li>
 	<li>Toys your kids no longer use</li>
</ul>
Any of those items can be sold for quick cash online. Here are some tips on how to make it happen:
<h3>Where To Sell Your Unwanted Stuff Online</h3>
There is no shortage of places to sell your things on the Internet, but here are some of the more popular options with the most traffic:
<h4>Craigslist</h4>
If you want to post your unwanted stuff online and have local buyers pick it up, Craigslist is a great option. The classifieds site gets a ton of traffic, and sales tend to move rather quickly.

Unlike other online options, Craigslist doesn’t charge fees to sell most items. If you’re arranging a local pickup, be sure to execute it in a safe public place.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>eBay</h4>
If you want to put your items in front of eyes worldwide, eBay is your best bet. You can sell your items for a fixed price or let the auction system work its magic.

On average, you can expect to pay a 10 percent fee when something sells. To make it sell, be sure to take tons of high-quality pictures and include plenty of relevant keywords in your product description. Doing so should help you unload it much quicker.
<h4>Decluttr</h4>
What’s one of the biggest drawbacks of selling your unwanted stuff? For some, it’s the work involved.

You may not want to sell everything separately. The thought of negotiating with buyers and arranging local pickups or shipping may turn you off as well. If so, a site like Decluttr can simplify the process.

Simply tell them what you have, and they’ll send you an offer. If you accept, you can ship everything off and get paid once Decluttr receives your items.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Facebook Marketplace</h4>
Another local option that gets a lot of traffic is the Facebook Marketplace. Will listing your items here guarantee quick sales? Not necessarily, which is why you should list your unwanted stuff on as many sites as possible to accelerate the process.","If you need a little extra cash to pay the bills, a second job may not be necessary.

3456,"5 Financial Aid Myths You Should Know","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Unless you have thousands of dollars saved up or make a solid income, you’ll probably need help in financing your college education. Where can you get that help?

You could reach out to your family and friends, although that’s probably not such a great idea. Instead, financial aid in the form of loans, grants, and scholarships is what will help you get over that hump.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Can financial aid help obtain your degree? Absolutely, as it can take a huge load off of your shoulders as far as money is concerned. But financial aid can be tricky, and these myths could put you in hot water if you aren’t aware of them already.
<h4>Financial Aid Myth #1: Your aid will cover all of your costs.</h4>
In a perfect world, there would be enough financial aid to go around for everyone who needs it. That’s not the case, though, as funds are limited. So, if you think that applying for financial aid and searching for scholarships and grants will cover all of your tuition, housing, and other costs, think again.

You may still end up needing to pay some expenses out of pocket. This can be done through part-time work, side gigs, or taking out loans that you’ll have to pay back later. In short, look at financial aid as help and not a complete cure for your costs.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Financial Aid Myth #2: All aid is free.</h4>
What constitutes “financial aid”? It’s usually these three things: loans, scholarships, grants. As such, financial aid isn’t necessarily “free money.” Are scholarships and grants free? Yes, which is why you should aim to apply for as many of them as possible in your quest to fund your education. But if you end up taking out a loan, that is not free, and you will be expected to pay the money back plus interest later on.
<h4>Financial Aid Myth #3: An offer of financial aid means you’re in the clear.</h4>
If you get offers for work-study or scholarships, congratulations. Both can help you pay for school. But just getting those offers does not mean that you’re in the clear or that the money is all yours.

Grants are a different story, as they’re usually awarded based on financial need. But if you get a work-study offer, for example, you will have to work to earn it, as if you were at a regular job. And if you get a scholarship, you will have to hold up your end of the bargain by keeping your grades up or fulfilling other requirements to hold onto that college cash.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Financial Aid Myth #4: You cannot negotiate financial aid offers.</h4>
You may receive financial aid offers that weren’t what you expected. They may be too low for your needs, and you may need additional help. If that’s the case, you can negotiate the offer to see if you can get more favorable terms. Financial aid officers will handle such appeals, and they’re worth your time if you’re really serious about funding your education with outside help.
<h4>Financial Aid Myth #5: Once you get an offer, you must accept it.</h4>
A financial aid offer is just that: An offer. It’s not a done deal or something that you must accept, even if you don’t want to. If you receive financial aid offers that aren’t helpful to your situation, contact the financial aid office and let them know that you’d like to decline them.","Before you accept any financial aid to help fund getting your degree, there are some myths you should be aware of.","2021-06-14 23:15:18",post,https://goodnesting.com/5-financial-aid-myths-you-should-know/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1367838347.jpg,shutterstock_1367838347.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1367838347.jpg,3457,shutterstock_1367838347,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1367838347.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,Education,publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,5-financial-aid-myths-you-should-know,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 13:45:46"
3463,"Missing Your Stimulus Check? Need Food? See What Biden Has In Store","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Some cash from a stimulus check and food assistance to feed your family. We’ll discuss how both can save the day with new orders signed by President Biden.

You may have gotten financially back on your feet after COVID-19, only to lose income to another shutdown. Or, if you’re not as lucky, you may have lost your job altogether.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Yes, the coronavirus offers two threats to people worldwide: The first is with their health, and the second is with their finances. While masking, social distancing, and washing your hands can increase your chances of staying healthy during the pandemic, keeping your finances in order can be a bit trickier.

If you’re like most, you’ve needed a helping hand during these trying times. Luckily, President Biden recently signed some orders that can provide that much-needed help, and they focus on stimulus checks and food assistance.
<h4>The Acceleration of $600 Stimulus Payments</h4>
You may have missed it amongst all of the news regarding Biden taking office, but Congress recently approved $600 stimulus payments to those falling within certain income limits.
Some have received these checks, while others are still wondering where their payments are. If you fall in the second group, you’ll be glad to know that Biden approved an order to streamline the stimulus checks’ delivery. In other words, if you haven’t received yours yet, keep your eyes open, as your payment should be on the way.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

How far can $600 go in a pandemic where working can be tougher than usual? Not very far, which is why it’s great to know that Biden is pushing for higher payments that would reach $2,000. If Congress passes such legislation, you could get $1,400 on top of the $600 you’re already owed.
<h4>The Increase of Food Assistance Benefits</h4>
You may be used to putting your own food on the table for all of these years. Once you lost your job or saw your income decrease due to COVID-19, however, you probably saw the need for some help, which is what food stamps or SNAP can provide.

To make it easier for people to feed their families, President Biden asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to boost its food stamp funding to states by 15 percent. Congress recently made a similar move to increase SNAP’s max benefit by 15 percent, but that excluded 40 percent of current food stamp recipients. Under Biden’s new order, 12 million extra people could get food assistance.

The news of higher food stamp funding was certainly welcome, but so was the increase of Pandemic-EBT benefits. This program offers electronic debit cards to students who normally get reduced-price or free meals. To help with the added burden of food costs to parents during the coronavirus pandemic, Biden pledged to increase Pandemic-EBT funds by 15 percent, while also making it easier to be eligible for those benefits. This move towards greater accessibility and funding could put an extra 100 bucks in the pockets of families with three kids.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Is Pandemic-EBT the only food program that will become more accessible to families in need? No, as Biden also said that food stamps should change their eligibility requirements to be more inclusive.","What could make your life easier with the coronavirus pandemic still in full swing?

3469,"Tips To Get Approved As A Section 8 Renter","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’ve had issues with paying the rent on time, a Section 8 voucher could help. The voucher will pay a portion of your rent directly to the landlord, and you’ll be responsible for picking up the rest of the tab.

Is applying for a housing voucher the only thing you need to do? No, because once you get the voucher, you’ll still have to find a place to rent.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Unlike other housing assistance programs, Section 8 lets you pick your own housing amongst apartments, townhomes, and single-family homes. To move into your new place, the landlord will have to accept you. Here are tips to gain approval from the landlord so that you can finally realize your dream of paying affordable rent.

Before we begin, click <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a> to learn more about Section 8 so you can apply for a voucher. With that out of the way, let’s look at those tips:

1. Call your nearest Community Action Agency. They can prepare you for the Section 8 process with classes on renting, tenant training, and housing readiness. Once you take these classes, let any potential landlords know, as it’ll make you look like a responsible tenant worth renting to.

2. Complete any substance abuse treatment programs, if needed. You’ll want to show the landlord that you’ve put your problems in the past and will be a good tenant.

3. Get copies of your credit reports. You can get them for free each year. You’ll want to keep them handy so that you can respond to any questions about past credit issues.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

4. Call the landlord to set an interview. Do this in a place that’s quiet without kids yelling or other distractions. Be polite when setting the interview, as first impressions are important. Also, don’t discuss any past problems over the phone. If you do, you could have marks against you before the interview even begins.

5. Be professional during the interview. Keep your kids at home if you know they’ll misbehave. Dress professionally and show up 15 minutes early.

6. Ask several questions about the property. Let the landlord know that you’re interested in the place, and the rules tenants are expected to follow.

7. If the property seems unsafe or has issues, or if the landlord seems rude or difficult to work with, don’t be afraid to move on. Red flags on the first meeting usually mean issues down the line that you’ll want to avoid.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

8. If the property interests you after touring it, ask the landlord about the screening process. They should give you paperwork on what it entails. They may ask about your rental history.
Tell them the truth and how you’ve fixed any issues. Don’t blame past landlords, as it could be a red flag during the interview.

9. Ask the landlord what your chances of approval are. If they’re not as high as you’d like, ask what you can do to alleviate their concerns.","Securing a Section 8 housing voucher can make your rent much more affordable.

3513,"4 Car Maintenance Moves That Aren’t Worth The Investment","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

It makes sense that getting preventive maintenance done on your car could help you prevent more significant headaches down the line. But are all services created equal? The answer is no, so while some may be worth the investment, others are not. We’ll discuss the ones that aren’t so you don’t waste your time or money.

Before we jump into the list, you should dive deeper into this topic before making any decisions on your car. Think of the list as a simple heads-up versus a professional recommendation, as vehicles differ in their year, make, engine, etc.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Tune-ups</h4>
Whether you go to the dealership or a regular mechanic, you’ll probably see several signs for tune-ups. While they can’t hurt, getting one done may not be in your best interest, especially if you’re on a tight budget.

Tune-ups were recommended with older cars that had different technologies and capabilities. Nowadays, most modern vehicles have onboard computers that keep an eye on performance. If anything’s off, the computer will let you know when it’s time to visit the mechanic to get the problem fixed. In short, tune-ups could be considered obsolete, so save your money.
<h4>2. Extended Warranties</h4>
If you’ve been looking at buying a car soon, you’ll probably be swamped with extended warranty offers that promise to cover car maintenance costs. Can they provide peace of mind if something goes wrong? Sure, but there are two main issues with extended warranties:
<ol>
 	<li>Many times, the cost of an extended warranty exceeds repair costs.</li>
 	<li>Some extended warranties are quite picky in what they cover.</li>
</ol>
If the car has an original warranty, use that. When it nears expiration, you can then decide on going the extended route, but you may find it to be more trouble than it’s worth.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Overpriced Oil Changes</h4>
Unless your car has a high-performance engine, you probably don’t need expensive synthetic oil. And as for getting oil changes every 3,000 miles, that may be too much.

The 3,000-mile recommendation is from the old days when cars and motor oil weren’t as advanced. Nowadays, every 5,000 to 7,500 miles is what you should aim for.

Do you tow heavy weight frequently with your car? Do you drive a lot in extreme climates? If that’s the case, then you may want to get oil changes every 3,000 miles.
Otherwise, you should be good to go at nearly double that mileage if you’re just a casual driver.
<h4>4. Dealerships</h4>
Can a dealership offer nice perks when you bring your car in for service? Sure, especially if it’s a large dealership for a luxury brand. Is bringing your vehicle to the dealership necessary if it is no longer under warranty? No, and it’s probably not your best bet either.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Dealerships have tons of operational costs they need to cover. To achieve this goal, they often charge higher prices.

You can get similar quality work done through an independent mechanic, if not better. And you can usually get it for cheaper too. Keep this in mind the next time you need your car serviced.","You may think you’re doing your car a favor by getting regular maintenance done.

3518,"Do You Lose Section 8 If You Move?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

You may have to move one day to relocate for a job, be closer to an ailing family member, or for some other reason. But if you’re receiving Section 8 housing assistance, you may be reluctant to move. Why? Because you don’t want to lose your housing voucher, as it pays a large portion of your rent and makes it easier to save money and pay other bills.

This brings up the important question of whether you lose a voucher when moving, or if you can transfer it. Let’s answer that now.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Transferring a Section 8 Housing Voucher</h4>
Here’s the good news: Yes, you can transfer a Section 8 housing voucher. In other words, you won’t necessarily lose that assistance just because you move to another place. There are some rules you’ll have to follow when transferring that voucher, however. They may vary according to location and your Public Housing Agency (PHA), but here’s the basic gist of what you can expect:
<h4>Notifying Your PHA</h4>
Since your PHA plays a huge part in the Section 8 process and is tasked with determining your eligibility, you’ll need to call or write them to let them know your moving plans.
You can do this by requesting an official transfer packet to kickstart the process.

You may hit some snags when trying to transfer your voucher to a new location, particularly if one of the following is true:
<ul>
 	<li>You’re currently in the middle of a lease with your landlord.</li>
 	<li>You owe the PHA or the landlord money.</li>
 	<li>You’ve been accused of violating Section 8 rules, and termination of your assistance is imminent.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

If you don’t hit any snags and are in the clear, you’ll need to give 30-60 day notice to your landlord. Your transfer packet will likely contain such a form that must be signed and dated by both you and the landlord. Each of you will keep a copy, with another going to the PHA. If you get a notice to vacate, that should be included as well. You can then submit the packet in person to the PHA or mail it.
<h4>Reporting Family Changes</h4>
Your PHA must always know if you have any changes to the family composition in your household. If you are adding or subtracting family members for your move, you’ll need to include this info with an interim packet added to your transfer packet.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Complete an in-Person Interview</h4>
Once your transfer request is received, you’ll need to meet with a coordinator from your PHA. They will review your info, and if everything goes well, you can receive your voucher that can be used at your new location, provided it meets Section 8 standards for safety and affordability.

Before deciding to move, keep in mind that this process can be costly, even if you have a voucher. You may have travel expenses, an overlap in rent that you’ll have to pay out of pocket, the need to take time off work, etc. All of those add up and can put a big dent in your bank account, so don’t proceed without a solid plan in place.","Will moving to a new place make you lose Section 8 assistance?

3521,"Section 8 Vouchers: What To Do Once You Get One","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

One of the easiest and quickest ways to pay less rent is to get a roommate. In doing so, you can split the rent payment and divide the financial responsibilities, so everything isn’t riding on your shoulders.

Unfortunately, roommates come with several drawbacks. First, they greatly reduce your privacy. Second, they may be loud or messy while refusing to obey house rules. And third, roommates don’t exactly fit in great when you’re living with family.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s a better option to pay less rent? Getting a Housing Choice Voucher from the government’s Section 8 program. Once you have it, the voucher will take care of the majority of your rent payment, which will give you some peace of mind plus added wiggle room in your budget.

To learn more about applying for Section 8 and to begin the process, <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">click here</a> and find your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA). It could take a while to get approved for a housing voucher, depending on your location. But once you’re good to go, here’s a breakdown of what to expect:
<h4>Finding a Home With Your Section 8 Voucher</h4>
Time is of the essence with your voucher. This form of housing assistance is in extremely high demand, and you’ll have to use yours before it’s given away to someone else.

As soon as your PHA grants your Housing Choice Voucher, dedicate as much time as possible to finding a home that fits Section 8’s standards. If you don’t do this before your voucher expires, you’ll lose the assistance and need to reapply.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

If you’re having difficulty finding a home, ask your PHA for an extension before the voucher’s expiration date. It’ll give you extra time to find what you’re looking for.

To avoid wasting time, only look for homes within the area designated by your PHA. Ask them about the rent as well. You will need to look for homes that are “affordable.” Not only that, they will have to be safe and in good condition, or they won’t pass the necessary Section 8 inspection.

What’s one way to use your voucher immediately? Using it to help pay the rent where you currently live, which is also known as “leasing in space.” Ask your PHA if this is an option if you’d like to stay where you are, but pay less for rent with your voucher’s help.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Know that you can transfer your voucher if you move, but you’ll typically have to wait until your initial lease is up. Also, don’t feel limited in your search to just apartments. Provided the property meets Section 8 requirements, you could even move into a single-family home.

Don’t assume that your Housing Choice Voucher will pay for all costs. It will pay a portion of your rent, but you’ll be responsible for any application/screening fees from landlords, as well as security deposits.","Getting a Section 8 voucher is a huge step towards saving money, as it can pay a big chunk of your rent.

3524,"The Dos And Don’ts Of Section 8 Home Inspection","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here are some dos and don’ts to ensure that the inspection goes smoothly, so you don’t lose your voucher.

If you get a Section 8 voucher, you’ll have certain rules to follow if you want to keep it. As with any rental agreement, you’ll need to abide by rules in your lease with the landlord.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

You’ll also need to follow Section 8’s program rules. What else is needed to maintain your Housing Choice Voucher? A yearly inspection of the property you’re living on. If you pass it, you’re good to go.

But if you fail the inspection, your Public Housing Agency (PHA) could nullify your voucher, causing you to lose Section 8’s biggest benefit, which is affordable rent.

What can you do to ensure you pass your Section 8 home inspection with flying colors? Follow these dos and don’ts:

<strong>Do:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Know that your entire house will be expected, so be prepared.</li>
 	<li>Contact your landlord ahead of time to make any major repairs.</li>
 	<li>Keep your smoke alarms in working order by replacing their batteries.</li>
 	<li>Clean all of your sinks in the kitchen, bathrooms, etc., so they look presentable. Do the same with your tub, toilets, and anywhere else impacted by water.</li>
 	<li>Keep your windows clean. You should be able to see out of them. If any windows are broken, get them fixed ASAP.W</li>
 	<li>ash your walls to remove any dirt or grime.</li>
 	<li>Clean your cooking range, range hood, and filter. Burnt countertops are a red flag for an inspector, especially if you have children.</li>
 	<li>Throw away your garbage as often as possible, so you don’t attract pests like rats and cockroaches.</li>
 	<li>Keep your floors clean. A quick vacuum/mop is a good idea right before inspection.</li>
 	<li>Fix any broken light fixtures.</li>
 	<li>Fix any broken doors or door jambs.</li>
 	<li>Fix broken bathroom fixtures, such as shower doors, faucets, etc.</li>
 	<li>Get any holes in the ceiling or roof patched.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<strong>Don’t:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Try to hide any issues or damage that you failed to repair. As mentioned, the entire home will be inspected, and the inspector must have total access to complete their job.</li>
 	<li>w your kids or any pets to run around during the inspection. Try to keep them separated or contained.</li>
 	<li>Keep junked furniture, appliances, or automobiles on the property.</li>
 	<li>Allow your landscaping to grow out of control. The lawn should be mowed and shrubs trimmed.</li>
 	<li>Allow garbage to accumulate inside or outside of the home.</li>
 	<li>Let your walls be destroyed by holes, excessive grease, mold, or graffiti.</li>
 	<li>Let your floors be damaged to the point that there’s torn tile, wood floors that are badly stained, or carpets with major stains, burns, etc.</li>
 	<li>Allow appliances to become inoperable due to abuse or neglect.</li>
 	<li>Let your utilities get turned off for nonpayment. This would look particularly bad during an inspection.</li>
 	<li>Allow the home to be infested with fleas due to pet neglect.</li>
</ul>

While those lists may seem long, the whole point is to keep the unit properly maintained, so you don’t have to make any last-minute fixes.

We’ll reveal them so you can keep rent affordable by participating in this popular government assistance program.

If you’re a legal resident and have a household income that falls below 30 percent of the median income where you want to live, you could be eligible for a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher. Why is this significant? Because it could mean paying just 30 percent of your income towards rent, with the voucher picking up the rest of the tab.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

While we won’t jump into the Section 8 application process, you can get started by <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">clicking here</a> and contacting your PHA (Public Housing Agency). For this article, we’ll jump to the point when you have your voucher, and what you’ll have to do to keep it.
<h3>Section 8 Tenant Obligations</h3>
It’s essential to fulfill your obligations as a Section 8 tenant. If you don’t, your PHA could terminate your voucher, and you’d lose that huge money-saving benefit. Here are some of the biggest obligations you’ll need to fulfill:
<h4>1. Find a suitable housing unit.</h4>
Getting a voucher is just part of the Section 8 equation. Once that happens, it’ll be in your hands to find a property to live in.

You won’t be living in public housing under Section 8. Instead, you’ll have to find private housing wherever your voucher was approved. To find such properties, you can ask your PHA or do an online search using the <a href=""https://resources.hud.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">HUD Resource Locator</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

The property you pick can be a single-family home, townhome, or apartment, but it must charge reasonable rent and meet the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards.
<h4>2. Pay application fees and the security deposit.</h4>
You may be charged an application fee by a landlord needing to screen you before accepting you as a tenant. You’ll have to pay this out of pocket, along with any security deposit, as your voucher will not cover these costs.
<h4>3. Live in the housing unit.</h4>
You won’t be able to get a voucher, find a property, and then lease the property to someone else. As the Section 8 applicant, you will have to live there, along with any other household members listed on your application. If not, you could be guilty of fraud.
<h4>4. Pay your portion of the rent.</h4>
You’ll still have some rent costs with Section 8, although they’ll probably be capped at around 30 percent of your income. You must pay your portion of the rent on time each month to continue receiving your voucher.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>5. Follow the rules in the lease.</h4>
As with any other rental agreement, you’ll have to follow the rules listed in your lease with the landlord. If not, you can be evicted.
<h4>6. Updating your PHA of any changes.</h4>
Your voucher amount is determined by many factors, two of which are your household size and income. If any changes occur to your family composition or income, you’ll have 10 days to report them to the PHA. If you don’t, you could face legal action and lose your voucher.
<h4>7. Providing notice when moving.</h4>
Your landlord and the PHA must be notified if you intend to move. This is so the landlord can find a replacement tenant, and so the PHA can stop sending your voucher to that location.","Once you get approved for a Section 8 housing voucher, you’ll have to do certain things to keep it.

3530,"4 Things You Must Know Before Applying For Section 8","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’ve heard of Section 8 before, it’s not by mistake, as it’s probably the most popular housing assistance program out there. What makes Section 8 so popular? It’s Housing Choice Vouchers that pay a significant portion of your rent directly to your landlord.

With Section 8, the rent becomes affordable. You won’t have to worry as much about paying your landlord, as your rent portion will be much smaller. And, as its name suggests, a Housing Choice Voucher even gives you the benefit of picking where you want to live. In other words, you can choose between single-family homes, apartments, and townhomes that are privately owned, as opposed to being limited to public housing buildings.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

While the thoughts of paying less for rent may have you chomping at the bit to apply for Section 8, there are some things you must know first. Most of them deal with eligibility, and they define what could keep you from getting approved for Section 8. Let’s have a look:

Before you apply for a Housing Choice Voucher, know the following:
<h4>1. Your overall household income.</h4>
It would be great if everyone were eligible for Section 8 housing assistance, but that’s not the case. Simply put, there’s not enough funding to go around to help everyone pay less rent. As such, Section 8 is reserved for low-income households who need it the most.

To qualify for Section 8, you will have to meet specific income requirements. This means that you cannot make more than a certain income and qualify. Household income includes how much you make, as well as other people who you intend to live with in your potential Section 8 home.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

You can see more information on Section 8 income limits <a href=""https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>. Or you can <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA)</a> to learn more.
<h4>2. The immigration status of everyone in your household.</h4>
Immigration status can be a bit tricky when it comes to Section 8 assistance. To get the max benefit, everyone in the household will need to have legal documentation to live in the U.S. However, only one person in the home must fit that description to apply.

If approved, your voucher will be based on the number of people with legal immigration status in the home.
<h4>3. The criminal history of everyone in the household.</h4>
Getting a Section 8 voucher with a criminal history can be difficult, but not impossible. You can still get approved, even if you have a felony or you’re on parole. However, it will depend on your PHA, as each does its own background checks and has different rules.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Certain crimes can eliminate you from Section 8 contention. One is being convicted of producing methamphetamine in federal housing. Another is being on the lifelong sex offender registry. Lastly, you can be rejected for Section 8 if you’ve been evicted within the last 36 months for drug issues.
<h4>4. Where you want to live.</h4>
If it looks like you pass the first three eligibility requirements, you’re one step closer to applying for Section 8. Next, you’ll need to figure out where you want to live and then find the nearest Public Housing Agency to apply. It’s important to remember that you don’t have to live in that area yet to apply there.","The Section 8 application process can be a long one. Before you take the leap to secure a Housing Choice Voucher, here are some things you’ll need to know.","2021-06-12 16:20:42",post,https://goodnesting.com/4-things-you-must-know-before-applying-for-section-8/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1575443998.jpg,shutterstock_1575443998.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1575443998.jpg,3531,"Small,House,Model,With,Question,Marks,Over,Reflective,Desk,Against",,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1575443998.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,4-things-you-must-know-before-applying-for-section-8,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-10-22 02:34:52"
3533,"What To Do Once You Have Your Section 8 Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The long wait is over. Depending on where you applied, you may have waited years to get your Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher. Now that it’s here, what’s next? We’ll discuss that now so you can finally achieve your goal of paying affordable rent.
<h4>Getting To Know Your Voucher</h4>
Your Housing Choice Voucher represents affordable rent and a bit of financial freedom. No longer will you have to pay most of your income to your landlord. Instead, your voucher will limit income paid towards rent to about 30 percent. What’s left will be paid by the Public Housing Agency (PHA) directly to your landlord.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Before you start looking for a place to use your voucher, you should know some essential things. First, your voucher will limit the size of your home. This isn’t necessarily a restriction on square feet, but instead on how many bedrooms it can have. Second, your voucher won’t have a set rent amount. To figure out your potential home's price range, ask your PHA before you start looking for properties.

While your voucher will pay a large portion of your rent each month, know that you will have to pay any security deposit. The voucher will not cover this expense, so plan accordingly. If you cannot afford a security deposit, look for deposit assistance programs in your state.

What’s an often overlooked expense with Section 8? Utilities. There have been cases where Section 8 tenants forgot to budget for utilities and found their monthly expenses unaffordable. To avoid this issue, ask your PHA what the utility allowance is. You can also ask landlords how much utilities are on average before solidifying anything.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Finding a Home With Your Section 8 Voucher</h4>
You can pick between single-family homes, townhomes, and apartments, as your Section 8 voucher provides that freedom. When searching and visiting different properties, take plenty of pictures. Take notes of the following too:
<ul>
 	<li>The property’s address</li>
 	<li>The type of building</li>
 	<li>The date, time, and place where you viewed the property</li>
 	<li>Names and titles of anyone you met</li>
</ul>
These notes are essential, as you may need them if you feel you were a victim of discrimination.

As for where to find Section 8 housing, you can try sites like Rently, Trulia, Socialserve, Zillow, and even the Facebook Marketplace. You can also use the HUD Resource Locator that will show you Section 8 properties on a map.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Once you find a property that you like, apply for a lease with the landlord. Read through the entire lease. Better yet, get someone from the PHA to read it along with you, so you understand all of the details. If everything’s a go, the PHA will need a copy of the paperwork, which should include a request for tenancy approval.

After you sign the lease, the PHA will set up a housing inspection to ensure the property meets Section 8 standards. If the inspection passes, you’ll be able to move in.","What should you do once you finally have that Section 8 voucher in your hands?

3536,"Don’t Want To Wait For Section 8? Do This","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you’re unfamiliar with what’s involved in the Section 8 process, here are the basics:
<ol>
 	<li>You think of where you’d like to live.</li>
 	<li>You contact the Public Housing Agency (PHA) for that area.You c</li>

 	<li>You find an apartment, single-family home, or townhome to use your voucher on.</li>
 	<li>You move in.</li>
 	<li>You pay your portion of the rent (around 30 percent of your income).</li>
 	<li>The voucher pays the rest.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If that process seems lengthy, it is. But it’s not so much that getting a Section 8 voucher is complicated. Instead, the main issue is that too many people need vouchers, and there aren’t enough of them to go around.

For this reason, it’s not uncommon for some Section 8 applicants to sit on a waitlist for years. And while your voucher could help you immensely once you get it, this long wait time can put you in a bind until that day comes.

Can you accelerate the process to get your voucher quicker? Sure. But that’s not accomplished by paying someone to move you up the list, as that is illegal. Instead, the primary method for moving up the Section 8 waitlist is to use specific preferences PHAs use to give certain applicants priority.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Section 8 Preferences</h3>
If any of the following apply to even one person in your household, let your PHA know as soon as possible. The more preferences apply to your situation, the better, as PHAs tend to use point systems to determine who gets to move up the waitlist.
<ul>
 	<li>You live in a shelter – If you live in a shelter, your PHA will likely move you up the list since you’ll be seen as someone needing emergency assistance.</li>
 	<li>You’re homeless – Like living in a shelter, this is seen as an emergency housing situation. It’s worth noting that living with friends or family may not be seen as homelessness, however, so check with your PHA for clarity.</li>
 	<li>You have a disability – You could get moved up even faster if your current housing negatively impacts the disability. For example, having asthma and living in a home with low air quality could be seen as a danger to your health, helping you move up the waitlist faster.</li>
 	<li>You’re 62 or older – Section 8 places a priority on providing safe, affordable housing for the elderly.</li>
 	<li>You’re a veteran – To qualify for this Section 8 preference, the veteran must have been honorably discharged from the military.</li>
 	<li>You make an extremely low income – Most recipients of Section 8 vouchers fit the “extremely low income” category, meaning their household makes just 30 percent of the area's median income.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

If any of those preferences apply, use them to your advantage. They may not get you a voucher tomorrow, but they can significantly accelerate the process.","If you don’t want to wait years to get your voucher, here are some ways to quickly move up the list.","2021-06-13 16:31:52",post,https://goodnesting.com/dont-want-to-wait-for-section-8-do-this/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1785139064.jpg,shutterstock_1785139064.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1785139064.jpg,3537,"Young,Beautiful,African,American,Girl,Wearing,Casual,T-shirt,Standing,Over",,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1785139064.jpg,,,,,,,,,Housing,"Section 8",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,dont-want-to-wait-for-section-8-do-this,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-23 13:49:55"

<h4>Housing Help</h4>
Besides staying safe during the pandemic, there’s nothing more important than having a roof over your head. What can threaten this? A lack of income and an inability to pay your landlord.

Until you get your finances in order, <a href=""https://legalfaq.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">see the status of evictions in your state</a>. You may be protected due to the pandemic, which could give you some added time to come up with some savings to appease your landlord later on.

If they can’t offer immediate assistance, the PHA may be able to help you get a Section 8 voucher that will give you housing stability in the future.

What’s the second biggest expense for many families after the rent? Utilities, and if you can’t pay yours, you’ll have a hard time living with the lights off.

COVID-19 caused many families to take a hard look at their monthly bills. As jobs were lost and income dropped, budgets got squeezed. And as the need to cut costs grew, many sought ways to shave their expenses.

If this sounds like your situation, you probably said it was time to cut some entertainment expenses. This shouldn’t have been too hard since everything was closed anyway due to the pandemic. What’s one expense that could have made the chopping block? The Internet. But since so many shifted to working and schooling at home, the Internet is now a necessity and not a luxury. In short, you can’t cut it because you need to be connected.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Luckily, you can stay connected without paying too much out of pocket, thanks to three companies. Here are their low-cost Internet plans that you should look into if you want to pay the least possible to get online.
<h4>1. Comcast</h4>
With Internet Essentials from Comcast, you can stay connected for $9.95 monthly plus tax. To be eligible, you’ll need to receive public assistance, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>SNAP</li>
 	<li>SSI</li>
 	<li>Housing assistance</li>
 	<li>National School Lunch Program</li>
 	<li>Medicaid</li>

<h4>2. Mediacom</h4>
Connect 2 Compete from Mediacom was put together to help students from low-income families get the Internet they need to complete school assignments at home. The program does this by offering speeds of up to 25Mbps for only $9.95 monthly plus tax.

If your child is enrolled in the National School Lunch Program, that may be all you need to qualify for Connect 2 Compete. And if you’re successful in qualifying, you won’t have to worry about any installation or equipment rental fees, a deposit, or a contract.
<h4>3. AT&amp;T</h4>
Access from AT&amp;T offers speeds up to 25Mbps for under $10 per month. Eligibility is based on whether you receive or qualify for public assistance like SNAP, SSI, etc.

Installation is free, there’s no deposit, and you won’t have to sign a contract to get AT&amp;T’s Access. Best of all, there are no overage data fees, as the company waived them during the pandemic.

<h4>Negotiating a Lower Rate With Your Current Internet Provider</h4>
What’s another company that could be offering cheap Internet in response to the coronavirus pandemic? Your current Internet provider.

The only way to find out is to call them and speak to a customer service representative explaining your situation. Tell them how the coronavirus has made it harder for you to pay your bills and that you may be considering canceling your Internet service. Since this is quite a common occurrence, you may be offered ways to lower your monthly bill, especially since they’ll want to keep you as a customer.","The coronavirus has made Internet service a necessity.

3550,"Have Questions About COVID Relief Stimulus Checks?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

If you haven’t watched the news much over the past several months, the government passed two rounds of stimulus checks or Economic Impact Payments.

While they don’t equal a huge amount of money, they could help you buy groceries, pay some bills, or begin building your emergency fund.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you were eligible for these stimulus checks, you should have received those payments by now via direct deposit to a bank account or by mail in the form of a check or prepaid debit card. The direct deposit will go to the same bank account you used to receive Social Security or other federal benefits or your last tax refund.

If some of your stimulus payments are still missing, you’ll need to file a 2020 tax return. This is true even if you do not usually file returns, as you’ll need to do so to receive the stimulus money.

Those are the basics regarding the Economic Impact Payments. Let’s now dive into some of the details.
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
First, let’s discuss who is not eligible for a stimulus check, so you don’t expect a payment that will never come. You will not be eligible if you are a nonresident alien, do not have a Social Security number that’s valid for employment, or can be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return.

Who is eligible then? Non-dependents who are U.S. citizens and resident aliens that meet the following income requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>Individuals who earn less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income.</li>
 	<li>Head of household filers with less than $112,500 in income.</li>
 	<li>Married couples filing jointly with less than $150,000 in income.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

If you make more than those amounts, you can earn a smaller payment as long as your income is below:
<ul>
 	<li>$99,000 for individuals.</li>
 	<li>$136,500 for heads of households.</li>
 	<li>$198,000 for married couples.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What to Do if You Haven’t Received Your Stimulus Payment</h4>
If you pass the eligibility requirements but haven’t received your stimulus payment or the amount was incorrect, file your 2020 tax return. You can do so for free through MyFreeTaxes.

As for the amounts, the first Economic Impact Payment was accepted in March of last year. It authorized payments of $1,200 per eligible adult and $500 per dependent child.

The second stimulus payment was authorized in December of last year. It was lowered to $600 per eligible adult and $600 per dependent child.

For further assistance with receiving your stimulus checks, contact one of the following:

As expected, there are several stimulus check scams where con artists are trying to steal people’s information or money. Some claim to be from the United Way, while others are from scammers pretending to be the IRS.

Know that the United Way or IRS will not contact you via social media, text, email, or phone requesting personal information verification. If someone does contact you saying they need your information to speed up a stimulus payment, ignore or block them immediately.

The IRS will not contact you via social media, text message, or email. If you get a call from someone claiming to be from the agency, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040 for confirmation.","A stimulus check from the government could offer a bit of COVID relief.

3569,"Factors That Make It Easier To Get A Homeless Hotel Voucher","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Here are some things that can make it easier to get a voucher so that you can enjoy the privacy of a hotel or motel versus an overcrowded homeless shelter.

What’s your number one goal when you’re homeless? If you’re like most, it’s probably replacing the home you previously had so you can gain safety and stability. Until you can get your finances together and gain employment, your options may be limited.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Unless friends and family can help, you may find yourself stuck in a homeless shelter. But if you’re lucky, you could get a hotel or motel voucher that could provide privacy, safety, and a sanitary environment, at least temporarily.

Before we get into some factors that can make it easier to get a homeless hotel voucher, let’s discuss how it’s only a temporary fix. While a homeless shelter can give you peace of mind knowing you have a place to stay for a decent amount of time, a hotel voucher cannot. Why? Because hotel vouchers usually give you a maximum stay of three nights at a hotel or motel.
That isn’t much time to fix your situation, which is why homeless vouchers should be seen as a luxury and not your main goal.

It’s also worth noting that homeless vouchers will usually place you in a motel instead of a hotel. This is because the agencies that fund vouchers need fundraisers to come up with the cash. And funding is quite limited, so more expensive hotels aren’t the most affordable option.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Factors That Improve Your Chances of Getting a Homeless Hotel Voucher</h4>
Even though motel vouchers are temporary and hard to get, you may still have your sights set on getting one. Here are some situations that can improve your chances of being selected for a hotel voucher:
<ul>
 	<li>You are now homeless because a disaster like a flood, fire, hurricane, etc., destroyed your home.</li>
 	<li>You are a victim of abuse or domestic violence and need safe housing.</li>
</ul>
Those two situations can put you at the top of the list for getting a hotel voucher. But the weather can help as well, mainly when it’s harsh. For example, if you are homeless and live in a big city, voucher distribution may increase during the summer months when temperatures get dangerously hot. The same holds true when winters produce freezing temperatures.

What else can help your chances of securing a motel voucher? Depending on your location, you may get priority if you are a single parent, single male, senior, or disabled.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Where to Find Homeless Motel Vouchers</h4>
Your mileage may vary when seeking a motel voucher. Do your best to contact each of these resources and as for hotel/motel voucher availability:

Tell them your situation, and be sure to explain why you need a voucher instead of a shelter. You could list concerns about security, safety, sanitary conditions, etc., to convince the person you’re speaking to that a shelter isn’t an ideal option.
<ul>
 	<li>Assistance programs in your state, city, or county</li>
 	<li>Your local homeless shelter</li>
 	<li>211 (may be the easiest option)</li>

It can be overwhelming to buy stuff when you have no money to do it. Thanks to the Internet, you don’t need money to get what you need, as there are plenty of sites that offer free stuff. Here’s just a sampling:
<h4>Furniture</h4>
You could visit a furniture store to buy a new couch. But that’s probably not your best move if you’re short on cash and are working with a limited budget.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you need furniture for functional purposes versus decoration, get it free via Craigslist. Under their “for sale” section, you’ll see “free.” While you can find almost anything at no cost in this section, such as barbecue grills, tires, or even pets, it’s often loaded with furniture to outfit your entire home on a budget of zero. As long as you have a vehicle big enough to move the furniture, you’ll be good to go.
<h4>Electronics</h4>
TVs may seem cheap nowadays, but there’s nothing less expensive than free. While you can use the Craigslist free section to find no-cost electronics, you may find some diamonds in the rough through the Facebook Marketplace.

Find your free electronics on this popular social media site, then look for an entertainment center to store them on. Although the items may not be the latest and greatest models, you can get them at zero cost now to save up for something better in the future.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Appliances</h4>
Whether you’re moving into a new, unfurnished place or your fridge or microwave breaks, you could get free appliances from Freecycle.org. Instead of tossing stuff in the trash and filling up landfills, this site believes in recycling items locally.
<h4>Books</h4>
You could check out books at the library for free or go to Littlefreelibrary.org to borrow books from locals.

If eBooks are your thing, you can gain access to over 60,000 of them through Project Gutenberg.
<h4>Moving Boxes</h4>
You may need boxes to move to a new place or store stuff in your new home. You can get them almost anywhere, but some stores known to offer free moving boxes include Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Target, Office Depot, Walgreens, Barnes &amp; Noble, Rite Aid, Dollar Tree, PetSmart, and Petco.
<h4>Firewood</h4>
The next time it gets chilly in your area, type “firewood” in the Craigslist free section or Facebook Marketplace. You should find some listings that’ll help keep you warm without paying a penny.

<h4>Free Samples</h4>
Would you like some free soap? How about free pet food or baby supplies? Whatever the item, you can probably find it at Freesamples.org.

Another way to get loads of free samples is through Pinchme. All you have to do is complete a profile, get free samples, and give your opinion on them. You can then claim coins to earn rewards later on that can be redeemed for prizes.","The Internet works wonders when you want to find deals and discounts quickly.

3584,"Education Highlights From President Biden’s American Families Plan","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

The American Rescue Plan was signed into law in March by President Biden. With it, $1,400 stimulus payments were distributed, schools reopened, and the COVID-19 vaccine began to reach recipients of all ages.

While that plan has shown plenty of signs of success, Biden recently announced his American Families Plan to help build back better even more. This new plan aims to invest in children and families, offering assistance for basic expenses, affordable health insurance, etc. Here are the highlights when it comes to education for students as young as three all the way up to college.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>American Families Plan Education Highlights</h3>
<h4>Universal Pre-School</h4>
Biden wants to partner with states to provide universal pre-school to all children ages three and four. If successful, this would save the average family $13,000 per year while offering schooling to over five million children. It would also give families the chance to enroll their children in pre-school services that are sometimes limited to those with higher incomes. In doing so, it would make it easier to work while their kids are in school to improve household income.

Universal pre-school would require a $200 billion investment to ensure high-quality education via low student-teacher ratios and more.

Anyone interested in being an early childhood educator would also receive benefits in the form of tuition-free community college, advanced on-the-job training, and competitive wages.
Pre-K and Head Start program workers would earn a minimum of $15 per hour.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Free Community College</h4>
With a $109 billion investment, the American Families Plan aims to help first-time students and workers enroll in community college at no cost so they can earn a degree or credential.
This move is being made to counter a decline in college enrollment due to high costs.

Once enrolled, students can use the free community college benefit for up to four years to complete their studies. Once implemented, Biden’s American Families Plan could help 5.5 million people attend community college for free across the country. It would also include funding for DREAMers.
<h4>Increased Pell Grants</h4>
Although seven million low-income students depend on Pell Grants, such funding has not been able to keep up with the ever-increasing costs of college. In fact, Pell Grant values have decreased over the last fifty years, prompting Biden to add $1,400 to the maximum Pell Grant award. Like free community college, DREAMers would also get access to these larger Pell Grants.
<h4>Improve College Completion and Retention</h4>
Studies show that getting a college degree can lead to financial stability, improved health outcomes, and more social mobility. It’s also been shown to reduce crime rates and benefit society as a whole.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Since only three out of five students complete degree or certificate programs, President Biden is initiating a $62 billion grant program to improve college completion and retention.
With this investment, the American Families Plan will allocate funds to offer mental health services, child care, basic needs grants, mentoring, and more to ensure that more students finish their secondary education.","President Biden announced details on his American Families Plan.

3587,"The American Families Plan Looks To Help Family Members Of All Ages","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

As you can tell by its name, President Biden’s American Families Plan looks to invest in households. While the plan could help families struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic, it looks as if it will keep them afloat well into the future too.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the plan’s biggest highlights, along with how they could affect your family members, both young and old.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Young Children</h4>
Children represent a family’s future. But it’s the children who can often suffer the most in struggling households.

Under the American Families Plan, a significant investment would be made to ensure children from low-income households get equal access to services that financially secure families enjoy.

For starters, preschool for kids ages three and four would be free. Parents would no longer have to worry about their young children falling behind their peers, as free preschool would give them the headstart they need. It’s estimated that free preschool would save parents $13,000 in child care costs.

However, child care must continue past ages three and four, which is why the American Families Plan wants to make it more affordable. Households with the most significant financial need would enjoy child care at no cost. Others, meanwhile, would only have to pay a small percentage of their income for child care.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Beyond lowered costs, the American Families Plan would ensure that child care would see improved quality. This would be achieved via higher wages for early childhood educators and other incentives to supply staffing.

What about nutrition? It’s another essential part of any kid’s growth that the American Families Plan will address by offering permanent funding for meals during the summer months.
<h4>College Students</h4>
Do you have teens in your home who are looking to go to college? Are you worried they won’t have the funds to do so? The American Families Plan would help thanks to free community college. And this could also allow you to go back to school to get your degree or credential.

Besides free community college, the American Families Plan would also increase the Pell Grant’s maximum award by $1,400. Anyone looking to get their degree would have a better chance of completing their studies as well since the plan would invest in improving college completion and retention rates.
<h4>Adults and Seniors</h4>
Paid family and medical leave is one of the biggest benefits of the American Families Plan. It would create a national leave plan highlighted by 12 weeks of paid leave at a maximum of $4,000 monthly.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

Health insurance would be more affordable if the American Families Plan is approved. Your insurance premiums could drop, as this feature of the American Rescue Plan would become permanent.

Taxes would drop under the American Families Plan too. You could get a Child Tax Credit through 2025. It would equal $3,000 for kids over six and $3,600 for kids younger than six.
The Earned Income Tax Credit would become permanent for childless workers, which would be huge news for those earning low wages.","Do you have people of all ages living in your household?

3591,"SNAP EBT Card FAQ","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

<h4>What is SNAP?</h4>
More commonly known as food stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps households in need purchase food to avoid nutrition deficiencies.
<h4>How do you receive SNAP benefits?</h4>
Even though many still refer to SNAP as food stamps, gone are the days when you use paper coupons to spend your benefits. Instead, you’ll receive an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card that functions like a debit or credit card. And if you’ve never used an EBT card before, don’t fret, as you’ll get instructions when you receive it, and cashiers know how it functions as well.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Where can you use an EBT card?</h4>
Like debit and credit cards, you can use your SNAP EBT card at places like convenience stores, grocery stores, and gas stations. Some farmers' markets accept EBT too.

As for other stores where an EBT card may work, you could use it at Target, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens. To be 100 percent sure, check on the store’s window for a sign that says it accepts EBT. You can also ask a worker for confirmation before shopping.
<h4>Can you use a SNAP EBT card to shop online?</h4>
Over time, more states are allowing for online purchases with SNAP EBT cards. When you receive your card in the mail, contact your local SNAP office to check if online purchases are okay. If so, that will help keep you safe during the coronavirus pandemic.
<h4>What can you pay for with an EBT card?</h4>
Since SNAP was created to help supplement families in need with nutritional foods, the answer to this question is no. There are limits to what you can buy. The general rules are that it must be food that’s not prepared. Here’s a specific list:
<ul>
 	<li>Bread</li>
 	<li>Cereal</li>
 	<li>Condiments</li>
 	<li>Dairy products</li>
 	<li>Desserts</li>
 	<li>Fats</li>
 	<li>Fish</li>
 	<li>Flavor extracts</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Meat</li>
 	<li>Non-alcoholic beverages</li>
 	<li>Oils</li>
 	<li>Pasta</li>
 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Rice</li>
 	<li>Plants or seeds that can be used to grow your own produce</li>
 	<li>Snacks</li>
 	<li>Spices</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

As you can see from that list, all of those items are necessities that can ensure your family gets the nutrition it needs. On the flip side, here are items that you cannot buy with your SNAP EBT card. Be sure to look over your groceries before checking out to see that none of the following are in your cart. If they are, you’ll have to pay for them with your own funds:
<ul>
 	<li>Alcoholic beverages</li>
 	<li>Cleaning supplies</li>
 	<li>Health or beauty products</li>
 	<li>Hot or prepared foods that are ready to eat</li>

If you lose your EBT card or it gets stolen, don’t delay contacting your local SNAP office. They will cancel the lost card and send you a replacement that could take up to seven days to arrive.
<h4>What happens if the power goes out and food purchased with a SNAP card spoils?</h4>
If that’s the case, contact your SNAP office to file a claim within 10 days. They will replace the spoiled food.","If you’re wondering how to buy food with your SNAP benefits, keep reading, as we’ll reveal how EBT cards work with some frequently asked questions and answers on the topic.","2021-06-15 04:00:35",post,https://goodnesting.com/snap-ebt-card-faq/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_202514146.jpg,shutterstock_202514146.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_202514146.jpg,3592,"Hand,Of,Customer,Giving,Credit,Card,To,Supermarket,Cashier,At",,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_202514146.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,snap-ebt-card-faq,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-08 15:06:45"
3594,"This Form Can Help You Combat Eviction During COVID-19","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Has the COVID-19 pandemic ruined your finances to the point that you can’t pay the rent? If so, you may feel as if you’ll see an eviction notice soon. But the CDC Eviction Moratorium can help you stay where you are without fear of eviction, even if you haven’t been paying the rent.
<h4>How the CDC Is Protecting Renters During the Pandemic</h4>
Evictions pose two major problems during the coronavirus pandemic. First, they destroy housing stability for families negatively impacted by coronavirus shutdowns and all of the job and income loss that followed. And second, evictions increase the probability of the virus being spread.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Think of what would happen if evictions occurred on a mass scale during this pandemic. Families would be forced to move into overcrowded shelters, making the spread of the disease likely. Or they would move in with friends and family in close quarters, which could cause more infections and hospitalizations.

To keep all of this from happening, the CDC created an eviction moratorium. It puts a halt to evictions due to nonpayment of rent until June 30, 2021. You can still be evicted for other lease violations, but not being able to afford your rent won’t be a reason why you can be kicked out of your home.
<h4>Rent Is Still Due</h4>
If you breathed a sigh of relief after reading that you won’t have to worry about evictions, for the time being, know this: The rent is still due. When? Once the moratorium ends, and even though it could be extended once again past June 30, you will have to pay your landlord any back rent and fees owed. In short, use the moratorium to save cash, as rent is a debt that will have to be paid.
<h4>Qualifying For the Eviction Moratorium</h4>
Besides the rent being due, here’s another thing many don’t know about the eviction moratorium: You have to apply for it, and everyone is not eligible.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

Applying for CDC eviction protection is as simple as filling out this short form and giving it to your landlord. The form determines eligibility, and it also declares promises from you that:
<ul>
 	<li>You will pay your landlord once the moratorium expires, or you could be evicted legally.</li>
 	<li>Without the moratorium, you would be evicted and homeless or living in crowded housing.</li>
 	<li>You’ve done everything in your power to at least pay some of the rent.</li>
</ul>
As for eligibility, it’s relatively straightforward. If one of the following applies from each of these lists, you should be good to go:

List A:
<ul>
 	<li>Received a stimulus check.</li>
 	<li>Made less than $99,000 individually or $198,000 jointly in 2020 or 2021.</li>
 	<li>Receive government assistance.</li>
 	<li>Weren’t required to report income to the IRS in 2020.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

List B:
<ul>

3608,"Are You Looking For Low-Cost Childcare In The Right Places?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Childcare is an expense you cannot avoid if you have kids. For this reason, you have to make sure you do everything in your power to make it as affordable as possible. If not, you’ll have <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/do-you-have-financial-problems-caused-by-the-covid-19-pandemic/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">trouble paying your bills</a>.

The cost of childcare can be so high that it causes some parents to quit their jobs. Why? Because the cost of their children’s care exceeds their income, which makes it impossible to make ends meet.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Well, before you quit your job or get frustrated over the lack of free or low-cost childcare, have a look at these avenues first. One may be what you need to not only put your child in good hands, but also to cut your costs.
<h4>Ask Your Friends and Family First</h4>
Before you roll your eyes and sigh at this suggestion, know that some people never ask their friends and family for babysitting help. As ridiculous as it may sound, they fail to ask because they feel like a burden, and this sense of shame keeps them silent.

If you haven’t asked for help in this department from your loved ones, you’re missing out on the most likely route towards free or low-cost childcare.

Complete strangers won’t take care of your child for free, and neither will most schools. Your friends and family might, though, and they’ll do it out of love and enjoyment for your child. Plus, you get the huge added benefit of being able to leave your kids with someone you know and trust.

Don’t be afraid to ask those closest to you for childcare favors. Who knows? They may even feel blessed that you requested. After all, you are leaving your most precious possessions with them, and that’s quite an honor.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Share Costs with Others</h4>
If your friends and family are in the same boat as you, you could ask to share childcare costs with them.

For instance, if you and a relative both need a babysitter so you can go shopping, you can hire one and split the bill.
<h4>Return the Favor</h4>
You can babysit other people’s children when they need it. Then when you need it, you can ask them to return the favor.
<h4>Barter Your Services</h4>
You’ll have to get creative here, but you can offer services to people you know in exchange for childcare.

For instance, if you have a neighbor who needs help with finishing a task, agree to do so. Then ask them to take care of your child so that they can return the favor.
<h4>Do Drop-Offs</h4>
Leaving your child in daycare on a set schedule can be super expensive. If you don’t need an entire day of babysitting, use a drop-off childcare center instead.

In this situation, you pay for the hours you need. By doing so, you can reduce your childcare expenses in a significant way.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>See What Your Community Has to Offer</h4>
What do preschools, daycares, churches, and other community organizations have in common? They usually offer some sort of childcare for their members on special occasions.

While this won’t take care of your everyday needs, knowing you can count on others to help can take some of the load off. Even if it’s just one Friday night a month, those are several hours where you won’t be paying for childcare, or you’ll get it at a deep discount.

To find out when such childcare events will be held in your city, look at your local newspaper, school and church bulletin boards, and even social media groups to get the scoop.","Free or low-cost childcare could be right under your nose without you even knowing it.

3613,"Tips To Avoid Or Pay Down Debt","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Deep debt can make it hard to <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-making-money-from-home/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">achieve your financial dreams</a> or even get a good night’s sleep. Follow these tips to avoid falling into that hole or get out of it as quickly as possible.
<h4>Change Your Spending Habits</h4>
Your debt will spiral out of control if your spending is uncontrolled. Unfortunately, it’s easier than ever to spend and buy things now, thanks to the Internet.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Whether you spend too much in person or online, here are some tips for shifting your spending habits so you won’t acquire so much new debt:
<ul>
 	<li>Only buy what you need.</li>
 	<li>Fight impulse purchases by only buying things on your list.</li>
 	<li>Block any websites that give you the urge to spend.</li>
 	<li>Avoid looking at coupons or online sales that could trigger unnecessary spending.</li>
 	<li>Remove any credit cards saved online so easy, one-click purchases aren’t an option.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Make Your Savings Automatic</h4>
If you’re not saving or investing, you’re spending. To avoid this, create an automatic savings account that will take a certain amount from your bank account and save it.

By taking this task out of your hands and making it automatic, you’ll have fewer excuses not to save. And by saving and stashing your money in a separate account, you’ll have less access to capital that can be spent on unnecessary items.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Build Your Emergency Fund</h4>
An emergency can quickly put you into deep debt if you don’t have any money saved for a rainy day.

By having an emergency fund sitting there should something happen, you can avoid using credit cards or loans to cover any issues. This will deplete your emergency fund, but it won’t put you into new debt.

On a side note, the need for an emergency fund means you shouldn’t take any large sums of cash you get only to pay down debt. If your emergency fund is lacking or nonexistent, build it up with that extra cash and then use the rest towards debt. This can keep you from accumulating even more debt in the future.
<h4>Use the Debt Snowball Method</h4>
Paying debt isn’t fun. It’s a chore, and that can keep many of us from trying to pay it off.

Make a list of all of your debts from smallest to largest. Then pay off the smallest ones first via the debt snowball method.

By eliminating small debts, you’ll gain momentum and feel more motivated to tackle the larger ones later on.
<h4>Set up Automatic Payments</h4>
It can be easy to forget to make a payment, which can damage your credit score, increase interest rates, and tack on late fees. To avoid this, set up auto-pay with your bank card, so you don’t skip a beat.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Pay Cash Whenever You Can</h4>
Swiping a credit card can give you a false sense of security as if you have unlimited purchasing power. Why? Because you get it right back after you swipe it.

Cash, on the other hand, disappears when you pay with it. Once it’s gone, it can give you a feeling of loss that you’ll want to avoid as much as possible. And to prevent it, you’ll make fewer impulse purchases and only buy necessities.","Some people enter the vicious cycle of deep debt and never get out of it.

3616,"3 Ways To Pay Less For Internet","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Think of how you use the Internet every single day.

You may use it to stay connected to friends and family via social media. Your kids may use it to complete homework and research school projects. You may use it to pay bills. Or everyone in the household may use the Internet for entertainment.

Regardless of what you use it for, the Internet is a must for most families that’s just beneath electricity and water when it comes to household needs.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are ways to minimize your monthly Internet bill so you can <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/tired-of-paying-for-cable-try-these-free-tv-apps/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">stay connected while staying within your budget</a>.
<h4>1. Call your current internet service provider (ISP).</h4>
Believe it or not, you can negotiate with your ISP to lower your bill. Give them a call, tell them you’re tired of paying too much, and see what they say.

If they refuse to lower your bill, say you’ll shop around with their competitors. You could also say you’d like to cancel to see if they change their tone.

ISPs hate to lose customers, and some will offer lower prices to retain them. By making a simple five-minute phone call, you could cut your monthly Internet bill significantly while still keeping the same level of service.

How much savings can you expect by calling and threatening to shop around or cancel? That depends on the provider. Some people, however, claim they were able to cut their bill in half just by making the call.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Shop around.</h4>
You may want to make this move before you even call the ISP. Doing so can let you know the types of plans that are available, plus what they cost.

With such information, you can provide actual comparisons to your ISP and ask them to beat those prices. If they don’t and you see a better deal, you can take it and switch providers to pay less.

If you don’t feel like calling a bunch of ISPs, go to their websites. Most will tell you which plans they offer, as well as any deals for new customers.
<h4>3. Get Internet service for low-income households.</h4>
If you are barely making ends meet and are close to losing Internet access because you can’t afford it, here are some affordable programs that may be able to help:

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<ul>
 	<li>Comcast Internet Essentials – This program offers reliable Internet speeds at 15Mbps for just $9.95 per month.</li>

 	<li>Lifeline – If you receive government aid and earn less than 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, you could receive discounts applied towards your Internet bill through this program.</li>

Is it hard to buy a good laptop nowadays? Not really, thanks to the Internet. Still, you should have some sort of procedure for making your laptop purchase since it’ll probably be pricey, and it’s a substantial investment.

What’s the best way to go about getting that laptop you need? Follow these tips.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Plan Ahead</h4>
While it may be tempting to buy the first laptop you see online or in a store, you have plenty of choices at your disposal. As such, making a plan will help you <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/if-youre-not-doing-this-when-shopping-online-youre-paying-too-much/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pick the best option without breaking the bank</a>.

To begin planning, come up with a budget. Since this laptop will be used to work from home, you don’t necessarily want to aim for the cheapest option.

Instead, get something that’s of quality, has excellent reviews, and has all the specifications to meet your needs, while still being affordable. With a budget in mind, you’ll be able to narrow down your selections.

Now that you know how much you want to spend, make a list of what the laptop will be used for, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Word processing</li>
 	<li>Browsing the Net</li>
 	<li>Email</li>
 	<li>Watching videos on sites like Netflix or YouTube</li>
 	<li>Gaming</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

The uses will determine whether or not you need a display that’s larger or smaller. And if you decide to travel a lot, you may opt for a more compact model.

Beyond the display, determining how you’ll use the laptop will help you figure out if it needs a more powerful processor, memory, video card, etc. With all of this data, you can start shopping online to find sufficient models in your price range, and then hopefully testing them at a store to see if you’re making the right choice.
<h4>Shop Around</h4>
Whether you’re shopping for your laptop online via Amazon, NewEgg, or TigerDirect, or in person at Walmart or Best Buy, don’t get the first one you see. If the laptop seems to be a perfect fit, search for competitor pricing to get the best deal. An app like Honey can help you achieve this goal of comparison shopping rather quickly, as can similar ones.

Also, don’t forget to read those reviews. Some may save you from the headache that comes with picking the wrong laptop.
<h4>Research Refurbished</h4>
If you’re not satisfied with the new laptops you can purchase within your budget, you may want to consider buying refurbished.

Although a refurbished laptop won’t be brand new, it can give you the functionality you need at a deep discount. Apple laptops, for example, are rigorously tested and cleaned before being sold. They come with all of the accessories and cables, plus a one-year warranty.

On a similar note, you could buy a used laptop from someone on eBay, for example. Before doing so, make sure you read the fine print, as a warranty may not be included, making you responsible for repairs early on.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Buy at the Right Time</h4>
If your existing laptop breaks or is no longer serviceable, you may need a replacement right away. But if you don’t need that new laptop now, you may want to wait until these times of the year where they’re more affordable than ever:
<ul>
 	<li>Black Friday or Cyber Monday</li>
 	<li>The back-to-school months (June-September)</li>
 	<li>Around product launches (September for Apple, October for Microsoft)</li>

3622,"The Comprehensive Guide To Section 8 Housing","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

Well, look no further than this comprehensive guide that will show you how the government’s Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8) can help.
<h4>An Introduction to Section 8 Housing</h4>
The U.S. government created its Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program to give low-income families a hand in paying for their home.

It has helped lift a million-plus people out of poverty while placing them into neighborhoods that are safer and less poor. By doing so, it can <a href=""https://goodnesting.com/are-you-looking-for-low-cost-childcare-in-the-right-places/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">improve the well-being of children</a> and their family members while also reducing the financial burden placed on other public programs.

Vouchers are awarded by local public housing agencies (PHA) depending on a family’s size, household income, and other factors. Once a family has a voucher, they can select the housing of their choice, as long as it meets the program’s standards.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Eligibility Requirements for Section 8</h4>
Before jumping into the application process for a Housing Choice Voucher, it’s best to know what the Public Housing Authority looks at when determining Section 8 eligibility. In doing so, you’ll have a better idea of the information you’ll need to provide when applying.

Here are the four significant factors a PHA will use to determine your eligibility for a voucher:
<h5>1. The size of your family.</h5>
In the government’s eyes, a family doesn’t necessarily mean a large group of people living under one roof. Instead, here are the various arrangements that qualify as a “family” when it comes to Section 8 eligibility:
<ul>
 	<li>Family with or without children – Even if a child is temporarily residing outside of the home and is in foster care, it is still considered part of the family.</li>
 	<li>Displaced family – If all family members are no longer living in the home due to destruction from a disaster, extensive damage, or removal by government action, they fall under the displaced category.</li>
 	<li>Disabled family – When a family’s head of household or single member has disabilities, two or more people in the home have disabilities, or one person has disabilities and resides with a live-in aide, it falls under the disabled category.</li>
 	<li>Elderly family – Where the head of household or single family member, two or more members, or one member residing with a live-in aide is at least 62 years old.</li>
 	<li>Remaining member of a tenant family – Where all members of a family receiving voucher assistance have moved out of a home, but one remains.</li>
 	<li>Single person – Someone who does not fit into any of the above categories.</li>
</ul>
<h5>2. Family income limits.</h5>
The Housing Choice Voucher Program was created to help low-income families who need it most. For this reason, income limits make up a considerable part of the PHA’s decision of who to award vouchers to.

Income limits vary by location and the number of family members in a household. They can also change from year to year. The PHA will place a family into three different categories depending on their income:
<ul>
 	<li>Extra low income</li>
 	<li>Very low income</li>
 	<li>Low income</li>
</ul>
For the most part, a family cannot earn more than 50 percent of the median income where they plan to live to be eligible for a voucher. The law requires PHAs to award 75 percent of their vouchers to extremely low-income households. This refers to families whose income sits below 30 percent of the poverty line or local median, whichever is higher.

If you’re worried that your income may be too high for Section 8, know that the more members in your family, the more you can make and still qualify.

You can view an example of Section 8 income limits here, where you’ll see how requirements fluctuate as family members grow. The maximum number of family members is eight.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h5>3. Your citizenship status.</h5>
The citizenship requirement for Section 8 can be a bit confusing. While citizens and certain permanent residents are technically the only ones eligible to receive help, other family members can still benefit from the program.

If a family has a variety of citizenship statuses amongst its members, it can receive prorated voucher assistance. This just means that the amount of money they’ll receive will be based on the number of family members who meet the citizenship eligibility requirements.
<h5>4. Your eviction history.</h5>
If you were evicted from public housing or a Section 8 rental in the past due to drug-related criminal activity, you will have to wait at least three years from the eviction date to be eligible for assistance.

Now that you know which factors your Public Housing Authority will take into consideration, it’s time to begin the Section 8 application process. But before you do, it’s a good idea to know what type of information and documents you’ll be expected to provide.
<h4>Information and Paperwork You’ll Need to Apply for a Housing Choice Voucher</h4>
There’s no better time than now to start collecting the documents you’ll need to apply for Section 8. You’ll need them for each family member, so they could take some time to gather.

Here are the basics:
<ul>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Social security card</li>
 	<li>Photo ID from the state or government</li>
 	<li>Driver’s license</li>
 	<li>Passport (if you are not a United States citizen)</li>
 	<li>Immigration documents (for both registered immigrants and aliens)</li>
 	<li>Immigrant status verification that’s signed</li>
</ul>
You’ll also need several documents to help prove that you fall within Section 8’s income limits. These will be harder to come by, but are necessary to complete the application process:
<ul>
 	<li>Proof of income, such as W2 forms, tax returns, and pay stubs</li>
 	<li>Bank statements</li>
 	<li>Information on assets, if you own any</li>
 	<li>Paperwork showing you receive benefits from public assistance</li>
 	<li>Social Security benefit verification letter</li>
</ul>
Without all of these documents, you will have a hard time getting approved. The PHA will use all of the information to see if you are first eligible for a voucher. If so, it will then use the same information to determine the voucher amount so you can pick out the appropriate Section 8 housing.

All of your paperwork and application answers must be authentic and true. The PHA will verify your information via local agencies, your bank, and employer to ensure it is correct.
<h4>How to Apply for a Section 8 Housing Voucher</h4>
You should try to apply for the Housing Choice Voucher Program as soon as possible since waiting lists can be quite long. Here are the steps to complete the process.
<h5>1. Locate your public housing agency.</h5>
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a website where you can find your local PHA. This is the first step to the Section 8 application process, as you’ll need to contact your PHA to find out more information about voucher requirements specific to your area.

Finding your PHA is as easy as clicking on the state you live in and scrolling down until you find the office nearest you.
<h5>2. See if you’re eligible.</h5>
The application can only proceed if you’re eligible for Section 8 assistance. Your PHA will help determine this by taking your family size and income into account.

As mentioned, the general rule for voucher eligibility is that your family’s income cannot be higher than 50 percent of the median income for your area. In addition, citizenship status and any eviction history will be reviewed before you can continue to apply.
<h5>3. Get a Housing Choice Voucher Program application.</h5>
If you’re good to go in terms of all of the eligibility requirements, it’s now time to get the official application so you can kickstart the process.

Your local PHA can point you in the right direction of where to get an application for free. Depending on where you live, you may get it online, in person at the PHA, or via mail.
<h5>4. Complete the application.</h5>
Take your time completing the application. You want to be as thorough as possible and ensure all the information is correct and truthful.

While the length may vary according to your PHA, expect to fill out basic information on things like date of birth, gross income, mailing address, phone number, criminal history, and more. Remember that these fields must be filled out for each family member, as they will affect your eligibility and the size of your voucher.

Your housing counselor should give you directions on how to fill out the application correctly. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact them first. This application could be your one shot at securing affordable rent in a safe home.
<h5>5. Submit the application on time.</h5>
As stated, the waiting list for the Housing Choice Voucher Program can be quite lengthy. As such, you do not want any delays in submitting your application that could stall the process even more.

Use your PHA’s instructions to apply once it’s fully complete. To avoid rejection, make sure it’s submitted by the due date.
<h5>6. Be patient.</h5>
Waiting is an unfortunate but necessary part of the Section 8 application process. Your application could take a few months to process, so sit tight.

After it’s processed, you will either be rejected or accepted and put onto a waiting list.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>The Housing Choice Voucher Program Waiting List</h4>
Once the PHA deems you eligible for a Section 8 voucher, you’ll have to wait until you actually receive it. Although the thought of waiting even more to receive government rental assistance may be daunting, at least you know you’ve made the cut.

You’ll rarely get a housing voucher immediately after approval. Since the demand for housing assistance is much higher than the supply of vouchers, sitting on the waiting list for an extended period is quite common.

Getting on a waiting list itself is an accomplishment, however, due to several factors. Some PHAs limit applications to specific periods. Others will close their waiting lists if they receive too many requests.

Luckily, you can apply via various PHAs if the one nearest you has a waiting list that is closed or too long. Ask your PHA to give you a list of where you can do this so you can widen your opportunities and shorten the time spent without assistance.

Once your name on the waiting list is reached, your PHA will tell you how to receive your voucher. To accelerate this, be sure to disclose any of the following situations on your application if they apply:
<ul>
 	<li>Your family has been involuntarily displaced by the government or due to disaster.</li>
 	<li>You’re currently living in substandard housing.</li>
 	<li>You’re paying more than half of your income in rent.</li>
 	<li>You’re homeless.</li>
</ul>
Such situations could gain PHA preference and move you farther up the waiting list, depending on the housing needs and priorities of your community.
<h4>Section 8 Voucher Value</h4>
A common misconception about Section 8 is that it allows low-income families to live completely rent-free. The truth is, families are required to pay 30 percent of their income or a minimum of $50 towards rent and utilities, whichever is higher, under the program.

The Housing Choice Voucher will cover the rest of the costs. There is a cap or “payment standard” to this coverage, however, that the PHA sets. This standard represents what it costs to rent a local home that’s moderately priced.

Can you choose a home that’s higher than the payment standard for your area? Sure, but you’ll have to pay any extra costs for that luxury.

Once your voucher value is determined, the PHA will pay that amount directly to your landlord every month. You will be responsible for paying the rest of the rent promptly.
<h4>Choosing a Section 8 Home</h4>
Another misconception about the Section 8 program is that you’ll have to live in a subsidized housing project once accepted. On the contrary, you can choose any housing that qualifies under the program's requirements, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Apartments</li>
 	<li>Townhomes</li>
 	<li>Single-family homes</li>
</ul>
Should it qualify, a family can also use their voucher to help pay the rent at their current residence.

To qualify, a home must meet Housing Quality Standards that cover such factors as:
<ul>
 	<li>A working kitchen</li>
 	<li>Access</li>
 	<li>Electricity and light</li>
 	<li>Indoor air quality</li>
 	<li>Materials and structure</li>
 	<li>Neighborhood</li>
 	<li>No use of lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Overall cleanliness</li>
 	<li>Sanitary bathrooms</li>
 	<li>Security and space</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Temperature control</li>
 	<li>Trash disposal</li>
 	<li>Water availability</li>
</ul>
If that list seems lengthy or complicated, don’t worry, as your PHA’s counselor will tell you what to look for so your home qualifies. This information will include the unit size you’re eligible for according to your family size.

You’ll have at least 60 days to use your voucher. Once again, you can use it to pay the rent in your current home or the new home you choose. Regardless of which route you pick, here’s what will have to happen to make your move acceptable:
<ul>
 	<li>The landlord will have to accept Section 8 vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA must confirm that the home meets local Housing Quality Standards.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA must confirm that the rent is reasonable compared to similar homes in the area.</li>
</ul>
After your home is chosen and approved, you will have to sign a minimum 12-month lease with the landlord. A security deposit may be required that cannot be more than one month's rent. After the contract is complete, your landlord can start a new one or allow you to stay in the home on a month-to-month basis.
<h4>Roles and Responsibilities Under Section 8</h4>
Here are primary responsibilities that come with being a Section 8 tenant:
<ul>
 	<li>Follow the lease agreement.</li>
 	<li>Follow the Housing Choice Voucher Program requirements.</li>
 	<li>Pay rent on time.</li>
 	<li>Maintain the unit in good condition.</li>
 	<li>Notify the PHA if the family has any changes in composition or income.</li>
 	<li>Abstain from any criminal activity that includes bribery, fraud, or drug offenses, among others.</li>
</ul>
You, as a tenant, aren’t the only one with responsibilities once a voucher has been disbursed, as the landlord, Public Housing Authority, and HUD have roles too.

The landlord must ensure that the housing unit meets Housing Quality Standards (HQS) while they receive voucher payments. The home must be safe and clean while being offered at a reasonable rent. Just like the tenant, the landlord must follow the lease agreement. Also, they must conform to the housing assistance payments contract signed with the PHA.

The PHA must supply voucher assistance to the family and make payments to the landlord. It has the right to stop those payments, however, if the landlord does not follow the lease agreement or the payment contract. The PHA will also do the following on an annual basis:
<ul>
 	<li>Review the family’s composition.</li>
 	<li>Review the family’s income.</li>
 	<li>Inspect the home to ensure it meets HQS.</li>
</ul>
Lastly, the HUD will transfer funds to the PHA so it can make voucher payments. It pays the PHA a fee for handling the Housing Choice Voucher Program and lets them apply for more vouchers to assist additional families. The department also oversees the PHA to ensure they’re following program guidelines.
<h4>Keeping Section 8 Benefits When You Move</h4>
Just because you have a voucher for one Section 8 home does not mean you cannot move to another. To do so without seeing a lapse in your assistance, contact your PHA before you make the move.

When moving to a new home, you will first be responsible for ending the existing lease with your landlord. You will also have to ensure that your new residence meets Housing Quality Standards.

Before you can move to an entirely new place, you will be expected to live for at least one year in the original service area of the PHA where you were first approved for a voucher. Again, contact your PHA first to avoid any lapses or, even worse, losses in benefits.

If you would like to become a homeowner after receiving Section 8 assistance, the Homeownership Voucher Program can help. It allows families to use their Section 8 benefits towards mortgage payments.

Rules and even the benefit calculation of the Housing Choice Voucher Program will apply should you make this move. You must also meet such criteria as:
<ul>
 	<li>Being a first-time homeowner.</li>
 	<li>No primary family member can own or partially own residential property.</li>
 	<li>No family member has either owned or partially owned their own home for at least three years.</li>
</ul>
Besides those basics, there will be minimum income requirements, as well as any rules set out by your local PHA. You will also have to complete a pre-assistance homeownership program and a course on housing counseling to fully qualify.
<h4>Contact the HUD</h4>
If you have any questions and want to contact the HUD directly to find out more about public housing assistance for low-income families, call 1-800-955-2232. They are open Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.","Do you need help paying the rent so you can enjoy safe, affordable housing for your family?

3643,"How To Save On Gas, Food, Tolls, And Entertainment When Traveling","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- Loans Offer -->

It’s no surprise that travel has exploded this summer. Since almost everyone around the globe has been cooped up over the past year due to COVID-19, the desire to hit the road is at an all-time high.

While you’re probably tired of being stuck at home, something may be holding you back from taking a much-needed road trip with your loved ones: A lack of money. We’re about to show you how you don’t need a ton of cash to travel, as these tips can help you save on several essentials.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Download GasBuddy to Your Phone</h4>
One big reason why so many may be hesitant to hit the road is the cost of gas. The numbers show that our current gas prices have hit highs not seen since 2014, and there are no signs of a slowdown either.

Could you downgrade your car to something smaller with less of an engine? Perhaps, but even used car prices have gone through the roof too, which is why saving some cents on each gallon is your best bet. How? By downloading the GasBuddy app.

As its name suggests, this app will be your best buddy when it comes to fuel. Not only can you use it to pinpoint the cheapest gas stations in the area, thanks to frequent price updates, but you can also use the GasBuddy card for significant savings.

The GasBuddy card links to a debit card. You use it when you need gas, which can save you up to 25 cents per gallon. Those savings then get kicked back to your card.

Here’s a bonus hack: If you have a loyalty card from a gas station like Circle K or Shell, use that in conjunction with GasBuddy to stack your savings.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Find Food Deals on the Go</h4>
Speaking of fuel, your family will need some food along the way to keep from getting “hangry.” And since you probably won’t be cooking up a meal in your car, local restaurants will likely be your best option for fueling up.

As you probably know, eating out can get costly, especially if you have a family. To find the best deals no matter where you are, use these two sites:
<ul>
 	<li>LocalSaver.com</li>
 	<li>RetailMeNot.com</li>
</ul>
<h4>Don’t Pay Tolls</h4>
The title of this section isn’t suggesting you drive through toll booths without paying, as that will just get you fined. Instead, you can avoid costly tolls altogether by planning your trip wisely.

For the manual approach, go to TollGuru.com to see which route is toll-free. You can also use your GPS or an app like Waze or Google Maps on your phone to adjust the settings so tolls won’t be an issue.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

<h4>Find No-Cost Fun</h4>
Can you plan a trip without paying for entertainment? It may seem like a stretch, but it is possible if you look around. Here are three sites that can help you find free entertainment wherever you’re headed:
<ul>
 	<li>Groupon.com</li>
 	<li>Eventbrite.com</li>
 	<li>Facebook.com/events</li>
</ul>
On each site, adjust the location to see what’s going on in the city of your choice.","Is a road trip on your itinerary soon?

<h4>Cut Cable Costs by 25 Percent</h4>
Have you counted how many cable channels you get? Regardless of the number, it’s probably a lot more channels than you watch. But if most of your cable lineup is a waste, you’re certainly not alone.

According to a study by Nielsen, the average home in the U.S. gets 200 cable channels. How many do they watch? Just 17.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you have similar TV watching habits, you should call your cable provider and ask them how you can pay less each month. If you use Spectrum or DISH, they may tell you about their budget tiers that offer fewer channels for a lower monthly cost. Opt for one of those tiers, and you could reduce your cable bill by as much as 25 percent.

There’s another way to save on cable too. It deals with DVR, which is something some households may have, but don’t use too often. If that’s the case in your home, return that DVR to save up to 20 bucks a month on the rental fee.
<h4>Save 33 Percent on Auto Insurance</h4>
The coronavirus shutdowns resulted in empty roads. This led to reduced car insurance rates that are now rising once again as things open back up. If you’ve noticed a hike in your car insurance payment, you could lower it by changing to a pay-per-mile rate.

Allstate, Nationwide, and Metromile are examples of companies that offer this unique auto insurance plan that charges you based on your driving habits. As long as you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, switching to pay-per-mile could save you over $400 annually, which equals 33 percent savings.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Save 50 Percent on Your Cell Phone</h4>
Have you thought about switching your cell phone service from T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;T to another service? Before you make that move, do some research on MVNOs or mobile virtual network operators.

These smaller companies use the same tech that the popular brands use, but at half the price. How can they be so cheap? Because they purchase their data and minutes from the more prominent companies at wholesale prices.

Google Fi, Ting, and Consumer Cellular are three examples of MVNOs that are not only a lot cheaper, but just as dependable too.
<h4>Save 30 Percent on Your Utilities</h4>
Due to the pandemic, most of us have spent a lot more time in our homes. What has that led to? Skyrocketing utility bills.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- Media.net-->

You can cut utility costs by conserving energy and water. There are other ways to pay less for utilities each month, though, that involve zero sacrifices.

Take the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), for example. Qualify, and you could cut your monthly utility expenses with help from the government. You could see cheaper utilities depending on where you live too. As an example, seniors in Louisville, Kentucky, who make less than $35,000 per year can get a 30 percent discount on their sewer bill.

To see what you qualify for beyond LIHEAP, search for utility assistance plus your location online.","Would you like to cut your cell phone bill in half, pay 33 percent less for car insurance, and save on other monthly expenses?

How popular is Netflix nowadays? So popular that it has over 200 million subscribers. This is excellent news for the company, but it’s not so great for consumers. Why? Thanks to Netflix’s popularity, they no longer have to lure in customers. In other words, getting free trials to Netflix is harder than it’s ever been.

Does this mean you’ll have to pay full price for your Netflix account? Not necessarily, as there are still some ways to get it free. And if you can’t get it at no cost, we’ll show you how to make Netflix more affordable.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>See if Your Cell Phone or Internet Provider Offers Free Netflix</h4>
Have you seen commercials from cell phone companies or Internet providers that include free Netflix for new customers? If so, that’s because those companies know Netflix is a desired streaming service, so by coupling it at no cost, they can get new customers.

Keep this in mind if you’re in the market for a new cell phone or want to switch Internet providers. If you want free Netflix that badly, you can factor it into your new decision and get it at no cost from a company like T-Mobile.

How far has T-Mobile gone to include Netflix as part of its sales pitch? So far that it has a program called “Netflix on Us” to entice new customers to make the switch to T-Mobile. They’re not the only ones, though, so search the Internet for other companies doing the same.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Use Someone Else’s Login</h4>
You can use this tip for Netflix or any other streaming service out there. Depending on the person you ask, you may get Netflix for free using their login and password. They may ask you to pay for part of their subscription, which still makes Netflix more affordable. And at the very worst, they’ll simply say no.

Either way, it can’t hurt to ask, as this is a method many people use to get Netflix at no cost or on the cheap.
<h4>Sign Up for a Free DVD Trial</h4>
The good old days where you could get one month on Netflix streaming for free are now gone. However, you can still enjoy entertainment on Netflix’s dime by opting for a free month of DVD rentals.

You’ll have to enter your payment information to get started, so make sure to cancel your trial before the 30 days are up if you want to avoid getting charged. Beyond that, you can look forward to a month of unlimited DVD rentals with free shipping and no late fees.

<h4>Use Coupon Codes to Lower Netflix’s Cost</h4>
If you try the first tips to no avail, you can use coupon codes off of the Internet to make Netflix more budget-friendly.

3788,"5 Tips To Get The Most Cash For College","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

Are you familiar with federal grants? They’re essentially free money from the government that can help finance some of your education, so you don’t have to do it yourself.

And while you may think such grants get gobbled up quite quickly, the opposite is true, as each year, there are about two billion dollars in unclaimed federal grants that students leave on the table.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

How can you get a piece of that pie? Do the following:
<h4>1. Apply instead of assuming.</h4>
How could there be billions worth of unclaimed federal grants each year? Because many students assume they cannot qualify.

Sure, some grants are based on financial need, but never let your income keep you from at least applying for aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can determine if you qualify for need-based aid, such as a Pell Grant. But it can also help you find merit-based scholarships and more funding from the federal and state governments and institutions.

The FAFSA is completely free to fill out and won’t take a ton of your time. So make it a point to fill it out, as that simple form could result in thousands of dollars for your college education.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<h4>2. Collect all the necessities.</h4>
To ensure filling out your FAFSA goes smoothly, prepare ahead of time and get all of your documents in order.

For starters, you’ll need a Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID). It serves as an electronic signature, and it’s a must for completing the FAFSA. Since it can take a bit of time to get this ID, don’t delay creating yours.

While you’ll probably need more documents to get your FSA ID and complete the FAFSA, here’s a basic list of things you can start getting together so you can start applying:
<ul>
 	<li>Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Driver’s license number</li>
 	<li>Income information (to include taxable and untaxed income)</li>
 	<li>Alien registration card (for eligible non-citizens)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Don’t delay.</h4>
Just because billions in federal grants sit unclaimed each year doesn’t mean you should wait until the last minute to fill out your FAFSA. Some financial aid is awarded to those who apply and are deemed eligible first, so by waiting, you could get left out. This is the case with Pell Grants, so get the ball rolling with your FAFSA right now.

Another reason to complete your FAFSA as quickly as possible is, so you get a head start in dealing with your school’s financial aid office. You may need to speak with them just before the next semester starts by waiting until the last minute. Why is this bad? Because that’s when they tend to get extremely busy, so customer service may lack when you most need it.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>4. Ask for help.</h4>
Don’t be afraid to ask for help from your school’s financial aid office if you feel overwhelmed when completing the FAFSA or looking to apply for scholarships and other grants.
Their expert advice can save you time and frustration throughout the process, while helping you secure more money for school.
<h4>5. Note any changes.</h4>
Since the FAFSA must be completed each year, be sure to speak up if anything changes regarding your household or your finances. For example, recent events led to a massive loss in income for many. By noting this loss, you can secure more funding for school, especially if seeking need-based aid.","Do you want to ensure you secure the most cash for college?

3792,"Sick Of Costly Cable? You Have Options","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

When it comes to monthly bills that give you a ton of bang for your buck, cable isn’t one of them. Why? Because your cable bill can easily surpass $100 per month, while you probably watch a small fraction of your available channels.

With so many people cutting the cord to live life cable-free, you may be wondering how to get in on the action. If so, keep reading, as here are some tips for cutting the cord while remaining entertained.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h3>Cable Alternatives</h3>
<em>Buy a digital antenna</em>

One reason why many people keep their cable is that they fear losing local channels that offer news, occasional sports, and network TV shows. The good news is that you can still enjoy those local channels without having a cable subscription, as a digital antenna should pick up their signal.

A digital antenna can cost around $15 while lasting for years. Best of all, it should pick up major networks like CBS, ABC, NBC, and FOX in HD quality. Depending on your location, your antenna could receive in the neighborhood of 40 channels at no monthly cost.

<em>Buy a streaming device</em>

Besides a digital antenna, here’s one way that many cord-cutters get free entertainment: By buying a streaming device such as an Amazon Fire Stick, Roku, Chromecast, or Apple TV.

Each of those devices can transform a regular TV into a “Smart TV” so you can stream both free and paid services. On the free end of the spectrum are options like Pluto TV, Tubi, Crackle, and Vudu. On the paid end of the spectrum are services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<em>Use TV network websites</em>

Some major TV networks offer streaming episodes or even live TV through their websites. Your mileage may vary when trying this option, but it’s a great way to get free content without having to pay a cable bill every month.

<em>Use the local library</em>

Libraries used to be places where you could simply check out books. Now, you can use them to check out free DVDs to enjoy the latest movies and TV shows.

While at the library, ask one of the workers if they offer any streaming services. Many libraries now have free streaming similar to Netflix, where you can watch movies and TV shows at no cost.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<em>Sign up for a paid service</em>

The following options will cost you. They should cost a lot less than your cable bill, however, and you can switch them each month, so you only get charged for one service at a time.

Some of the most popular paid streaming services include:
<ul>
 	<li>Netflix and Amazon Prime Video – Ideal for streaming popular movies, TV shows, plus original content.</li>
 	<li>Hulu – Like the two above, Hulu has movies, TV shows, and original content. But it also has live TV for $39.99 that can replace your cable lineup.</li>
 	<li>Sling TV – This cable replacement can cost anywhere from $35 to $50 per month.</li>

Working from home can be ideal if you have kids. Not only can it boost your income, but it can also save you money from having to pay for childcare.

Unfortunately, kids can make it hard to work from home since they can be so distracting. And if you were looking into customer service, you can’t talk to people on the phone with your kids being noisy in the background.

3801,"6 Ways To Get Medical Bill Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

When you’re hit with a medical emergency out of the blue, the only thing on your mind is getting better. Unfortunately, once you get better, those medical bills start rolling in. And depending on what work you had done, you may be wishing that you never got help in the first place.

Unless you have deep pockets or a massive emergency fund, you’ll probably end up going into medical debt due to unexpected bills. There’s no need to feel alone, though, as over 72 million people in the U.S. have the same issue.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

Whether you’re recovering from a car accident, slip and fall, or some other injury, here are ways to get medical bill assistance so you can heal without worrying about money.
<h3>Resources for Medical Bill Assistance</h3>
Several organizations offer help with paying bills. Since your mileage may vary, try them all to wipe out as much medical debt as possible.
<h4>1. Medical Billing Advocates</h4>
A medical billing advocate is an expert on the topic. They know everything about medical billing, which helps them spot expensive errors that you may never notice. But beyond spotting costly errors, medical billing advocates are also professionals at negotiating lower bills.

What’s the issue with this option? Medical billing advocates can be costly. Depending on how much they can shave off of your bills, they may be worth it, though.

If you can’t afford an advocate, you may be able to solicit their services at no cost through your employer. You could also see if the Patient Advocate Foundation can offer no-cost or low-cost assistance.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<h4>2. Healthcare Providers</h4>
Sometimes your best bet is to contact the healthcare provider directly for help. They won’t pay your medical bills, but they can lower or eliminate them, depending on your situation.

For instance, you may have received an enormous hospital bill that you know you cannot pay. If you call the hospital, you can ask if they can reduce or eliminate the bill. If they decline, tell them your financial situation and ask if they have a department that handles such affairs. If the medical provider is a non-profit, you may be in luck. And if not, they may be able to put you on a manageable, no-interest payment plan that fits your budget.
<h4>3. Children Relief Funds</h4>
If your child got sick and that resulted in hefty medical bills, see if your state offers Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Funds. Massachusetts and New Jersey do, so you may have luck by taking this route.

<h4>4. Churches</h4>
Your local church may lend a helping hand if you tell them your situation. It’s not uncommon for local religious organizations to hold fundraisers and ask the community to chip in for a good cause.
<h4>5. Use a Fundraising Site</h4>
While a church can hold a fundraiser, you can do the same via a site like GoFundMe. Set up a fundraiser online and share it over social media. It could get you the help you need with minimal effort. Be sure to include all of the details of your medical emergency to achieve the intended effect.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>6. Disease-Specific Organizations</h4>
If you suffer from a specific illness, you may find bill-paying assistance through an organization.
For example, these organizations help pay bills for specific diseases:
<ul>
 	<li>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society</li>
 	<li>The Patient Access Network Foundation (PAN)</li>
 	<li>The HealthWell Foundation</li>
 	<li>The CancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation</li>

3804,"How To Get Emergency Help With Your Rent, Utilities, And More","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

Keep reading, as we’ll show you how the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program can help pay your bills.

The U.S. Department of Treasury has a program that can save the day if you have problems paying rent and other housing expenses. It’s called emergency rental assistance, and it has tens of billions of dollars to its name.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

While that’s great news for families still struggling during the pandemic, the ERA hasn’t been 100 percent peachy. Sure, it has plenty of financial backing, but the fact that those billions are tied up between 495 state and local programs has left many confused and, even worse, unpaid.

What does it take to get a piece of this life-saving pie? Let’s take a look.
<h4>Applying for Emergency Rental Assistance</h4>
If you didn’t know that the emergency rental assistance program existed, you’re not alone. In fact, not knowing it’s out there is one of the biggest reasons why just a tiny percentage of the money has been distributed to families in need. What does it take to apply? You can start by finding your local program here.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

If you’re having issues finding an ERA program near you, don’t fret, as you have other options. First, you can contact your local Public Housing Agency. Not only can they help with emergency rental assistance, but they can also help secure your housing long-term via Section 8 or other programs so you won’t have to worry about it again. And if you want a quick way to get help, get someone on the phone by calling 211. It’s a hotline that specializes in all forms of assistance and not just housing.
<h4>Emergency Rental Assistance Benefits</h4>
Just by looking at its name, you’d assume that emergency rental assistance only pays for rent. Luckily, it pays for much more, as housing costs extend far beyond your monthly rent payment.

Although each local program has its own set of rules, many emergency rental assistance programs across the country can help you pay for utilities. In other words, if you’ve been worrying about your lights or water getting shut off, the ERA program can help with those bills as well. The benefits don’t stop there, though, as you can also get help paying for Internet.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

What about other housing-related expenses? Chances are, you may have incurred some by having to move due to issues with your landlord. If so, the ERA program may be able to pay for moving expenses. Do you have any late fees for not paying the rent on time? They may get taken care of, too, as well as any new screening fees, application fees, and even security deposits.

Is that all the ERA program can do for you? No, as you may also qualify for legal representation and housing counseling to ensure your past and future situations get fixed.

If all of those benefits sound good, contact your local program now to see if you qualify.","Are you worried about your family’s well-being now that eviction protections are over and extra unemployment is gone?

The coronavirus came out of nowhere and left many people jobless and short on income. To keep families afloat, the government stepped in with stimulus checks, expanded unemployment, PPP loans, an eviction moratorium, and more.

Unfortunately, much of that assistance has disappeared, leaving many families wondering how they’ll keep a roof over their heads and ensure their children stay fed. If that describes your situation, don’t fret, as the following steps can fix your finances, even in these tough times.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>1. Look for ways to replace your lost income.</h4>
Stimulus checks? They’re gone, at least for now. Those expanded unemployment benefits? They recently disappeared too. And that eviction moratorium has also ended, meaning you’ll need to find ways to start paying your rent and bills while keeping food on the table.

While this may seem overwhelming, the great news is that there are many ways to replace your lost income. Best of all, you can do it quickly.

For starters, there are many “bridge jobs” you can take on to start getting some cash flow. Sure, these bridge jobs may not be in your industry, but they can give you some income and the breathing room that comes with it. And before you brush off jobs that you always ignored in the past, know that many are paying more than ever before, so you could be pleasantly surprised.

Want examples? Food service jobs are everywhere, and they’re raising wages to get employees in the door. And if you aren’t a fan of retail work, companies like Target are so desperate for workers that they’re even offering to pay college tuition as a bonus.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

Of course, you may have other obligations that keep you from taking a traditional job. If that’s the case, you can use a side hustle to bring in fast cash while making your own schedule.

Whether it’s driving for Uber, delivering food via DoorDash, doing baby or pet-sitting gigs on Care.com, or completing odd jobs on TaskRabbit.com, the side hustles and the cash that comes with them are out there.
<h4>2. See if you can get more unemployment.</h4>
If you really enjoyed the help unemployment benefits provided, contact your state office to see if you can qualify for an extension. That extra federal money has dried up, but you may still be in luck as far as your state is concerned.
<h4>3. Get your rent taken care of.</h4>
Have you heard of the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program? It has tens of billions of dollars set aside to help people pay overdue and future rent, plus utility bills, moving expenses, and more.

You can learn more about this program and find your local office <a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>4. Make sure your fridge stays full.</h4>
A quick call to 211 can help you find emergency food assistance in your area so your family’s nutrition won’t suffer. Then, you can apply for SNAP benefits (food stamps) to get money every month to go grocery shopping.","With much of that help drying up, here’s what you should do to ensure your bills get paid.","2021-06-16 21:43:35",post,https://goodnesting.com/if-youre-short-on-cash-follow-these-steps/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_176841248.png,shutterstock_176841248.png,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_176841248.png,3808,shutterstock_176841248,,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_176841248.png,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Savings and Loans",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,if-youre-short-on-cash-follow-these-steps,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-10-20 13:26:22"
3818,"8 Ways To Find Housing After A Felony","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

The adverse effects of a felony can seem unfair, especially if you never showed a constant pattern of committing crime. Whether it’s looking for employment or housing, being always told no may make you feel as if you’ll never get your life together.

If this has been your reality so far, know that it can change quite quickly, specifically when it comes to housing. While we’ll discuss ways to find felon-friendly apartments, we’ll also share some tips on alternatives that can put a temporary roof over your head should that search yield no results.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h3>Ways to Find Housing as a Felon</h3>
<h4>1. Apartments</h4>
What better way to re-enter society than with your own apartment? It can give you the privacy you desire and allow you to maintain distance from any possible negative influences.

While finding a felon-friendly apartment may be your first choice, it’s worth noting that it could be the most challenging route if you just got out since apartments may:
<ul>
 	<li>Be managed by companies with strict guidelines.</li>
 	<li>Require background checks from landlords.</li>
 	<li>Be in high demand, depending on location.</li>
 	<li>Carry a higher monthly cost.</li>
</ul>
With that being said, searching for apartments is still a worthwhile move to make. You can search for apartments in your desired location directly through Google, or go to sites like:
<ul>
 	<li>Apartments.com</li>
 	<li>Craigslist</li>
 	<li>Rent.com</li>
 	<li>Zillow</li>
 	<li>Zumper</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

Try to find apartments that don’t have background checks. If you’re lucky, you may even find listings that say they are felon-friendly upfront.
<h4>2. Sublets</h4>
Sometimes a tenant needs to break their lease. An easy way to do this is to lease to another tenant, which could be you.

How could a sublet be felon-friendly? If that tenant needs to let go of their lease instantly, which could make them more willing to work with you.

Some apartment listings have sections for sublets, or you can search for them directly on a site like Sublet.com.
<h4>3. Section 8</h4>
You could be gold if you get a Section 8 housing voucher, as it will pay the majority of your rental expenses so you can start to save up money for other uses. Although Section 8 vouchers can take a long time to process, they’re worth mentioning due to the eventual long-term stability they can provide.

To learn more about Section 8 and the Housing Choice Voucher Program, go here.
<h4>4. Re-Entry Programs</h4>
There are support systems that help felons get back on their feet. These re-entry programs are not only useful for finding housing, but they can also help you find a job to know two huge tasks off of your list.

You can find some re-entry programs by <a href=""https://lionheart.org/prison/state-by-state-listing-of-re-entry-programs-for-prisoners/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">going here</a> and selecting your state.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>5. Hotels or Motels</h4>
Some hotels or motels allow you to rent them for extended stays. Such an option could easily replace an apartment by giving you the privacy you need. Best of all, many extended stay hotels and motels do not require background checks.
<h4>6. Rooms, Basements, etc.</h4>
As you start to put your life back together, you may want something simple and inexpensive. A single room or basement that someone rents out of their house could fill that void. Depending on the person, they may not require a background check.
<h4>7. Referrals</h4>
Does your parole officer know of felon-friendly housing options? They might, which would make your search much easier.

You can also ask friends and family, church members, coworkers, or anyone else you know for a referral. Doing so could result in more success than doing an actual search online.
<h4>8. Friends and Family</h4>
If all else fails, you can turn to your loved ones for housing help. Check with them to make sure housing a felon will not affect their lease, as it can sometimes cause issues.","Has your housing search gone sour since a felony hit your record?

3821,"This HUD Program Could Help You Lose Your Landlord And Buy A Home","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

Ask most people what’s keeping them renting instead of owning, and they’ll probably say this: A lack of money, as they feel that owning a home is something only people with a lot of savings or income can do.

What if it was possible to buy a home without a ton of savings or income, though? And what if this finally helped you “fire” your landlord to become that homeowner you always dreamed of being?

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

The good news is that it’s definitely possible, and the way to do it is to buy a HUD home. Is a HUD home some form of public housing? Not at all. It’s just a home that the HUD purchased after the borrower defaulted on their FHA loan. And to make back whatever money it invested, the HUD puts that home back on the market at a low price to hopefully find a buyer fast.
<h4>Incentives for Buying a HUD Home</h4>
If the thought of buying a house below market value entices you, know that the potential savings with HUD homes don’t stop there. To start, the HUD could offer the home for just $1 under its One Dollar Program that sells property at this ridiculously cheap rate after it’s been on the market for half a year.

How about getting a home with just $100 down? That’s another incentive you could enjoy with a HUD home under the agency’s $100 Down Program.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

Are you a public servant? Do you work as a firefighter, police officer, emergency medical technician, or teacher? If so, you could get half-off a HUD home’s price through the Good Neighbor Next Door Program.

Another incentive offered with HUD homes is the possibility of a voucher to pay part of your mortgage or housing expenses. This may be offered through the Homeownership Voucher Program.

Lastly, you could snag a steal indirectly through the Non-Profit Program. Community organizations can buy HUD homes at a 30 percent discount. As a service to the community, they’ll repair the homes and put them on the market at an affordable price so low-income families can buy them.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>The Good and the Bad of HUD Homes</h4>
Are HUD homes perfect? No, as they do have certain aspects you should be aware of. First, know that HUD homes are sold as-is. If you don’t have any money to invest in repairs, this could be a negative. Second, you’ll have to live in a HUD home for at least a year, so it’s not ideal if you’re looking to flip the house immediately. And third, you will need to work with a HUD-approved agent to bid on the home during an auction.

With all of that said, it’s hard to deny the money-saving benefits of buying a HUD home. You can get one at a lower price than the market offers, plus get help with the HUD programs listed above. In the end, you’ll have to decide whether the pros outweigh the cons.","Are you sick of padding your landlord’s pockets with your hard-earned cash?

3827,"Make These Simple Moves To Stop Overpaying For Electricity","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

When you need more wiggle room in your budget, one of the first things you should do is look at your expenses. Some expenses can be cut relatively quickly, such as eating out or entertainment. Others, however, like your electricity bill, cannot, as you need it to survive. But since your electricity bill is often the second-highest monthly expense behind the rent or mortgage, you should try to reduce it at much as possible.

We’ll show you how to do that so you can free up some cash for other bills.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

<h3>How to Lower Your Electric Bill</h3>
<h4>Apply for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</h4>
If you qualify, LIHEAP can offer assistance with making your utility bill more affordable.
<h4>Reduce Your AC Costs</h4>
Your air conditioner is an energy hog. And depending on where you live, it could be running all day long, pumping up your utility bill to astronomical levels. As such, you should do everything in your power to keep your cooling and heating costs low.

To start, keep your shades closed when you’re not home or are not in the room. This will keep sunlight out that will raise the temperature in your home. Similarly, you can install tinted window film for relatively cheap that will also block the sunlight.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

When you leave your home, adjust the thermostat, so it’s not as “comfortable” inside. This will keep your unit from running when nobody really needs it. You can also install a programmable thermostat to do all of the work for you and keep your AC costs in an ideal range.

Lastly, try relying on fans more than the AC. They’re cheaper to run and can still give you that desired comfort.
<h4>Make Your Fridge More Energy-Efficient</h4>
Every three months, clean your refrigerator coils. If they get dirty, they will make your refrigerator work overtime to stay cool, and this will drive up your utility bill.

If you have the funds to do it, make sure your refrigerator is as full as possible. The items inside of it act as insulation, so it doesn’t have to work as hard.
<h4>Be Smart With Your Stove</h4>
Do you keep your stove running until the very last second when cooking? Try turning it off a couple of minutes before you’re finished and use the built-up heat to your advantage. This will reduce your electricity usage while still keeping your food warm.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Unplug Unused Devices</h4>
As old-fashioned as this bit of advice seems, unplugging your devices when you’re not using them can prevent phantom energy from making your bill skyrocket.

What is phantom energy? It’s electricity that devices tend to use even when they’re turned off. And even though the amount of electricity they use isn’t a lot, it can add up since studies estimate phantom energy accounts for 75 percent of your electricity usage.

A quick way to avoid phantom energy is to buy some cheap power strips. Switch them off when you leave the room to completely turn off multiple devices at once.","Would you like to see a decrease in your electricity bill next month?

3830,"A Quick Guide To Finding Free Internet For Low-Income Families, Students, And Seniors","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

The Internet used to be seen as a form of entertainment that was primarily used by younger generations. Now, it’s a tool people of all ages and backgrounds are using daily for things way beyond entertainment.

Young kids now need the Internet for virtual learning and to complete homework assignments. Parents need the Internet to work from home or do online side gigs. And seniors use the Internet for telehealth appointments and to shop online.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

What can keep someone from gaining the Internet access they need to complete daily tasks? A limited budget, which is why we’ll discuss ways to find free or affordable Internet so you can overcome that obstacle.
<h4>Getting Free Internet Due to the Pandemic</h4>
The Internet has become essential as ever due to the coronavirus. It forced students to shift their learning entirely online, and many employees had to convert their homes into offices to work remotely. Online shopping for groceries became popular, as people chose to avoid crowds and get their necessities delivered. And the Internet also gave everyone a way to see their loved ones via video chat, as social distancing prevented in-person get-togethers.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

Seeing how the Internet became so essential, the FCC decided to make it more accessible through the Emergency Broadband Benefit. Announced near the end of February, the program promises a monthly benefit of up to $75 towards your Internet bill if you qualify. If you don’t pay that much for Internet at the moment, this means you could get free online access once this program goes live.

Besides offering free Internet, the Emergency Broadband Benefit also promises to make computers more affordable. It does this by providing $100 towards purchasing a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet.

To learn more about this new program from the FCC and see if you qualify, go <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.
<h4>Free Internet for Students</h4>
As mentioned, students of all ages started taking online classes due to COVID-19, making home Internet service a must. Although it may not be free in some cases, theConnect2Compete program can offer affordable Internet to households with students through Cox or Mediacom.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Discounted Internet for Seniors</h4>
If seniors didn’t use the Internet much before the pandemic, they now do for telemedicine, online deliveries, keeping in touch with loved ones, and more. FCC’s Lifeline program offers a monthly discount of $9.25 on Internet service, which seniors can get based on income or if they receive veterans pensions or survivors benefits.

3833,"Is A Hotel Voucher Or A Homeless Shelter Better For Your Health?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll take a look at which option is best for your well-being by discussing the pros and cons of hotel/motel vouchers versus homeless shelters.

If you’re evicted and have no place to call home, your top concern is finding a place to stay. And if you have a family, you need to find that place fast to ensure your loved ones are safe and their basic needs are met.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

What’s usually your best bet when you’re homeless and on the verge of living on the streets? Staying with friends or family, as they can offer familiarity plus provide a bit of mental calm to help you fix your situation. And if you have no savings, they can offer a place to stay at no cost, depending on how strong your relationship is.

Unfortunately, everyone cannot rely on friends or family for temporary shelter, forcing them to look at other avenues, such as hotel vouchers and homeless shelters. Each avenue has its benefits, but if your health is a significant concern, one is better than the other, as we’ll show right now.
<h3>The Purpose of Homeless Vouchers for Hotels or Motels</h3>
If you’ve never heard of this homeless service before, a hotel or motel voucher can help you pay for a room if you’re out of money and need somewhere to stay.
<h4>Motel Voucher Advantages</h4>
Staying in a hotel or motel offers privacy, as you have your own room that isn’t shared with strangers. And since you’ll be in your room with a door you can lock, you won’t have to worry so much about your safety.

You can enjoy peace and calm during a time when your anxiety is probably extremely high, making a voucher an excellent option for preserving your mental health while you’re homeless. You can preserve your physical health, too, since a hotel or motel room will usually be more clean and sanitary than a shelter.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<h4>Motel Voucher Disadvantages</h4>
By now, you probably think a hotel or motel voucher is your best bet while homeless. Vouchers do have their disadvantages, though, especially when it comes to availability.

A motel voucher is expensive. The organization that funds it cannot provide such housing for all of the homeless out there. So, even if you get a voucher, you will only be able to use it for a limited time, with three nights usually being the maximum stay.

The short-lived nature of hotel vouchers can actually add to your anxiety, as you may not be able to enjoy the peace and calm such a setting can provide. And if you spend a lot of time and effort trying to find a voucher, that can take its toll on your mental and physical health too.

As for where to find hotel vouchers, you can try contacting your local Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, or homeless shelter. You can also dial 211 or search online for homeless assistance in your area.
<h3>Homeless Shelters</h3>
<h4>Advantages of Homeless Shelters</h4>
Knowing you have a place to stay for an extended period can provide peace of mind. This stability gives homeless shelters the edge over hotel vouchers if you don’t want to waste a ton of time and effort looking for a home.

If it’s cold outside or you’re experiencing stormy weather in your area, a homeless shelter can keep you from getting sick. Homeless shelters are also a lot easier to find, unlike hotel vouchers. A shelter can also offer additional resources, like mental health counselors, healthcare, and food to ensure your nutrition is taken care of.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Disadvantages of Homeless Shelters</h4>
Homeless shelters can provide stability and health resources. But they can also be bad for your health and lead to instability at the same time due to:
<ul>
 	<li>Overcrowding</li>
 	<li>Other residents who pose a threat</li>
 	<li>Alcohol and drug abuse</li>
 	<li>Violence/theft</li>
 	<li>Sanitary issues</li>
</ul>
With all of that being said, your best bet is to use a combination of a homeless shelter and hotel vouchers until you get your own place. Use all of the resources (especially ones for health) at your disposal and work hard to find employment, so you can ensure your homelessness is short-lived.","While putting a roof over your head is probably your top priority when you’re homeless, you still have to consider your health.","2021-10-22 02:59:26",post,https://goodnesting.com/is-a-hotel-voucher-or-a-homeless-shelter-better-for-your-health/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1523326748.jpg|https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_184899737.jpg,shutterstock_1523326748.jpg|shutterstock_184899737.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1523326748.jpg|/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_184899737.jpg,3847|3834,"Woman,Renter,Holding,Paper,Bills,Using,Calculator,For,Business,Financial|Men,Sitting,On,Beds,In,Homeless,Shelter",|,|,|,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1523326748.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,is-a-hotel-voucher-or-a-homeless-shelter-better-for-your-health,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-10-22 20:17:24"
3836,"Is Hulu Free?","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

Keep reading to see if you can use it to entertain your family without affecting your budget.

Are you looking for ways to make room in your monthly budget without making huge sacrifices? If so, cutting the cord may help, as there are streaming services out there that are more affordable.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

One such service is Hulu, a competitor of Netflix. Is it free? No, but we’ll show you how to make it free for at least one month so you can see what the streaming service has to offer in terms of movies, TV shows, and original content. And if you want to continue using Hulu in the future, we’ll also tell you how to enjoy it at its lowest cost.
<h3>Hulu’s Different Plans</h3>
Now that you know Hulu isn’t free, here’s a look at what you can expect to pay if you  become a recurring customer:
<ul>
 	<li>Basic plan with advertisements - $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year.</li>
 	<li>Plan with no ads - $11.99 per month.</li>
 	<li>Hulu with ads and a live TV lineup - $64.99 per month.</li>
 	<li>Hulu with no ads and a live TV lineup - $70.99 per month.</li>
</ul>
If you opt for Hulu with a TV lineup, that basically replaces your entire cable. If you opt for the other plans, you’ll get access to Hulu’s impressive catalog of original content, popular TV shows, and movies.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<h3>Tips to Enjoy Hulu for Free or at a Reduced Cost</h3>
<h4>Free one-month trial</h4>
One area where Hulu beats Netflix is its free trial. Netflix used to have a free trial when it wasn’t so popular, but as it grew to be the giant it is today, the company decided to eliminate its free streaming trials.

For new customers, Hulu offers a one-month trial. To get it, you will have to enter payment information. To avoid getting charged, you simply have to cancel your free trial before your first month is over.

The most significant benefit of the one-month trial is that it lets you see everything Hulu has to offer. If you like what you see, you can continue. If you don’t, you can cancel without getting charged a thing.
<h4>Hulu coupon codes</h4>
If you want to continue to use Hulu past the one-month trial, using an online coupon code can make a dent in its price. You can find coupon codes on sites like Coupons.com or RetailMeNot.com, or use Google to search for “Hulu promo codes” and “Hulu coupons.”
<h4>Free Hulu with a Disney+ Bundle</h4>
Your kids will probably love Disney+, which comes in a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu for $12.99 per month total. That’s a solid deal for three major streaming services.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>Free Hulu via Sprint Unlimited</h4>
Get a Sprint Unlimited plan for your cell phone, and you’ll get free Hulu as a reward for becoming a customer.
<h4>Sharing a Hulu account</h4>
The most straightforward way to get free Hulu now and in the future is to ask for someone else’s login. They may not want to share it for free, though, so you could end up paying your portion of the monthly subscription.","You’ve probably heard of Hulu and know it’s a streaming service like Netflix, but is it free?","2021-10-22 04:02:42",post,https://goodnesting.com/is-hulu-free/,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1737576413.jpg,shutterstock_1737576413.jpg,/chroot/home/a5ee630d/goodnesting.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1737576413.jpg,3838,"African,American,Woman,Lying,Down,On,Sofa,At,Home,,Choosing",,,,https://goodnesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1737576413.jpg,,,,,,,,,Resources,"Emergency Assistance",publish,1,admin,mj.bustria@sedulen.com,,,is-hulu-free,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-10-22 04:02:42"
3840,"Find Out If You’re Eligible For Emergency Rental Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

The coronavirus pandemic led to job loss, which made it impossible for many families to pay the rent. Luckily, eviction protections were put in to prevent people from being tossed onto the street, but even those ended.

What’s your next move for keeping a roof over your family’s head? If you’re still struggling financially and need help paying the rent, the U.S. Department of Treasury has just what you’re looking for.

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

It’s called the Emergency Rental Assistance program, and it has billions of dollars in aid to help families who need it most. How can you participate in this program before it’s too late? Let’s take a look.
<h4>Eligibility for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program</h4>
While it’s great news that the government set aside billions in rental aid, there’s one major problem: People haven’t been getting it. That may have been okay when evictions were stopped, but now that they aren’t, families need that ERA cash fast.

Where is that cash? Split amongst 495 state and local programs. Each has its own rules and regulations, making it tricky to figure out if you’re eligible. We’ll tell you who to contact to get an official take on your eligibility, but first, let’s look at the basic requirements to qualify for assistance.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

First, you need a rental agreement in place for your home. It doesn’t need to be a signed lease specifically. And your “home” could be a single-family house, apartment, mobile home, or some other dwelling.

Second, one person in your household must be eligible for unemployment, lost income, owes significant expenses, or has financial hardships.

Third, at least one person in your household must have housing instability. In other words, they’re facing homelessness or can’t find a place to live.

Lastly, your household income will have to be below a certain level to qualify. That level will depend on your location.

Those are the primary emergency rental assistance requirements. Whether you feel you qualify or not, contact your local program to get a definitive answer. You can find that program via this link. Other options include contacting your local Public Housing Agency or calling 211 and asking for emergency rental assistance.

[the_ad id=""3004""]<!-- AD04 -->

<h4>What Emergency Rental Assistance Covers</h4>
As you probably know firsthand, housing costs involve much more than just the rent. Luckily, the ERA program can cover the following in addition to your rent, depending on your location:
<ul>
 	<li>Internet</li>
 	<li>Electricity</li>
 	<li>Water</li>
 	<li>Gas</li>
 	<li>Trash removal</li>
 	<li>Sewer</li>
 	<li>Moving expenses</li>
 	<li>Late fees</li>
 	<li>Application fees</li>
 	<li>Screening fees</li>
 	<li>Security deposits</li>
</ul>
As you can see, if you’ve been forced to move due to the pandemic and an inability to pay rent, the ERA program can help with those costs. And depending on your local program, you may also receive housing counseling and legal representation.

Since all of this information may be a lot to take in, your best bet is to contact your local program now to get the ball rolling on emergency rental assistance.","If you’re worried about being evicted, the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program could save the day.

3843,"SNAP Benefits Are Going Up. Here’s How To Apply","[the_ad_group id=""77""]<!-- AD01 -->

If your budget was tight before due to the pandemic, it’s probably a lot tighter now. Even if you’ve done your best to save money, essentials are getting more expensive, which means your dollar doesn’t go as far as it used to. Need proof? Go to the grocery store and buy your usual items. You’ll see that your bill is a lot higher, even without expensive impulse purchases added to the mix.

One way to offset those food expenses is with help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. With it, you can get monthly benefits (that some still call food stamps) to go grocery shopping without putting a massive dent in your pocket. 

[the_ad id=""3001""]<!-- AD02 -->

If you’re already familiar with SNAP, here’s some exciting news: You should be getting more cash on your EBT card so you can buy more groceries or lessen the sting of those rising food costs.

How much more money can you expect from SNAP? According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the amount is $36 extra per month for the average SNAP recipient. That equals almost an extra $150 per month for a family of four that can use that additional money to buy more meat, chicken, and fish, so their kids get more protein. They can use the increased SNAP benefits to buy more fruits and vegetables with essential nutrients to boost immunity. And for added convenience and less stress, they can also stop relying so heavily on local food shelters, as their food stamps will cover more costs.

The monthly SNAP increase goes live in October 2021. It will give 42 million SNAP recipients more money for groceries, representing the most prominent food stamp boost since 1975. If you’re not a SNAP recipient, you may be wondering if you’ll be left out in the cold. As long as you meet SNAP’s eligibility requirements and apply for the program, the answer is no.

[the_ad_group id=""78""]<!-- AD03-->

<h4>Applying For SNAP Benefits</h4>
Although most families could use food stamps to help buy groceries, the program is intended to assist those with the most financial need. Eligibility for SNAP depends primarily on your income. As long as you make less than a certain amount for your area, you could get food stamps to start filling your fridge. While your local SNAP office will have the specifics, a family of four should have a monthly gross income that does not exceed $2,871, while their monthly net income should not exceed $2,209.

To begin the SNAP application process and see if you’re eligible, visit this link. Contact your SNAP office to kickstart the process, and get help with filling out your application if necessary via the following resources:
<ul>
 	<li>Dial 211 on your phone</li>
