You may not have the time to meet new people or go out with your friends. Some parents may just be afraid of judgment. That, however, does not mean that single parents cannot have healthy social lives.

More than 13 million households in the country are made of single parents, both men and women. Staying in touch with friends and colleagues can be a difficult task when most of your time is split between childcare and work, yet many people have been through single parenthood successfully. In the following sections, we provide some steps to help improve your social life.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Apply for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</h4>
Once you have a clear understanding of your desired love life, ask yourself why you have not been able to achieve it yet. If your problem is that you do not have enough funds, apply for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. It may help you get money to cover basic needs. That way, you can save some of your money for socializing.

Note that the grants are not just given to anyone. Your case will be evaluated to determine whether or not you qualify. Additionally, you will be asked to participate in work activities that will help you get back on your feet. As a single parent, the requirement is usually 30 hours per week. Keep in mind that TANF benefits are not indefinite. The government provides assistance for up to 60 months or until you find a new job.

<h4>Get Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h4>
Another way to save up some money to improve your social life is applying for SNAP.Each state has its own list of requirements for the program. SNAP, also known as Food Stamps, is a food assistance program by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Single parents can use it to increase food security and access high quality food cheaply.

Beneficiaries will be asked to do several hours of work-related activities, such as community service or employment search. These activities are selected by the SNAP Employment and Training Program, which helps single parents improve their social life and readiness for work.

About 46 million low income families benefit from SNAP every year. Some religious organizations operate local food assistance programs that, when coupled with the SNAP benefits, can help a single parent cover all of their nutritional needs.

<h4>Get Child Support</h4>
Being a single parent, you may be forced to spend most of your time working to pay your bills. That does not always have to be the case. If you are unable to socialize because most of your time is spent at work, it may be time to file for child support from your children’s other parents.

Your ex has the responsibility to take care of the kids just like you do. You may not be able to get public assistance from the government before you file for child support. The types of government support that you can get include low-cost housing and rent assistance. Reach out to your state child support office. They are responsible for enforcing child support payments.
<h4>Take Advantage of Childcare Grants</h4>
Child care grants offer compensation for child care related costs that single parents incur when they have to be away. Use those funds to find safe and reliable sitter service. You can use the time off to meet new people or try out new hobbies.

Most states usually offer childcare services to help your kids grow healthy and well-educated. They are often called Early Start, Head Start and Pre-K. Single parents can save thousands of dollars by applying for these programs if their children meet the age criteria. Watch out for any grants for single parents that your state may offer.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>College</h4>
There are plenty of good public colleges where single parents can meet other people. Colleges have individuals of varied backgrounds and you get to meet and interact with many of them. The best thing is that you do not just get to meet new people, you also get educated. Some public colleges offer childcare and other daycare benefits for students who are single parents. Ask around the colleges close to where you live to find out more about their benefits.","Being a parent is a full-time job and it is especially hard if you are a single parent.

2494,"Guide to Childcare Help Programs","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Over the past few years, the costs associated with childcare have increased more than twice as the median income of a majority of families since the year 2000.
<h2><strong>Financial hardships of childcare programs</strong></h2>
The cost of childcare services can vary significantly from state to state. For instance, the average annual fees associated with government-funded childcare services goes from slightly above $3,900 in Mississippi to more than $15,000 in Massachusetts. Childcare costs are usually determined by the age of the child, with infants having the most expensive rates.

This surprising oscillation of childcare costs per state can put a family in financial struggle. Households with two working parents are faced with the decision to keep working or abandon one job to take care of their children. Even with two sources of income, many working families are unable to cover the increasing costs of childcare in their state.

<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h2><strong>Financial resources for childcare programs</strong></h2>
All states receive funding from the federal government to finance a variety of childcare assistance programs. Most parents can expect to receive financial support from these programs through several avenues, such as subsidies, vouchers, fee assistance, and more.

The government provides financial assistance to make sure eligible families can cover the costs of childcare in the state and go on with their daily activities. Among the list of financial aid programs, we find some worth mentioning:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Head Start/Early Head</strong> – These twin programs are designed to offer financial assistance to parents who have children that are two years old or younger. Most states have Head Start programs that support the mental, social and emotional development of children.</li>
 	<li><strong>State-Funded Pre-K</strong> – There are some states that fund full or half-day pre-kindergarten programs to children between three and five years old. The main goal of Pre-K programs is to increase and improve the overall school readiness of children living in the state.</li>
 	<li><strong>DoD and Military Assistance Programs</strong> – As the name suggests, this is a childcare fee assistance that becomes available to members of the military. Those who served in the defense, or other duties aimed at protecting the country, are eligible to receive these unique benefits to help raise their children.</li>
 	<li>Government help and other subsidies such as the <strong>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</strong>, which operates under similar rules as Medicaid, and offers affordable high quality health insurance to millions of children across the country.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Government childcare services and subsidy programs help a significant number of families raise their children. They offer financial support to cover the cost of a government-funded childcare center or a regulated childcare home. How much is covered will depend on the annual gross income of the family. Some well-known government subsidies are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>General Service Administration</strong> subsidies – This program was created to assist GSA employees. It provides financial assistance to cover most childcare costs.</li>
 	<li><strong>National Park Service</strong> subsidies – Similar to GSA benefits, these subsidies were created to assist NPS employees. They receive financial support to ease the burden of paying for quality childcare.</li>
 	<li><strong>U. S. Customs and Border Protection / U.S. Coast Guard</strong> – These agencies operate a variety of financial assistance programs designed to help their employees cover the costs of the childcare services they need. They are similar to the benefits offered to GSA and NPS employees across the country.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Some of the government subsidies include:
<ul>
 	<li>A childcare fund designed to offer recipients cash assistance to cover emergency childcare payments and other critical childcare-related expenses.</li>
 	<li>Part-time assistance for families who need it most, to guarantee that their children receive quality childcare and attention.</li>
 	<li>Dependent care and child tax credit, which gives families the incentive to sign up for childcare at all times, knowing that their bottom line will increase and their taxes will decrease.</li>
 	<li>Earned and child tax credit, additional incentives to enroll in childcare and provide their children the best attention. These initiatives also promote job seeking.</li>
</ul>
If you want more information about the full list of benefits provided by government-sponsored childcare programs in your state, benefits.gov is the best place to check. Along with a detailed list of benefits, this government website also provides information about eligibility requirements as well as steps to follow to submit an application.","A majority of families need childcare.

The federal government and other institutions are aware of the financial struggle single parents go through, and offer support to cover basic needs such as food, childcare and more. In this guide, we provide information about federal and nonprofit programs that provide financial aid to single parents.

<h2>Assistance from Nonprofits</h2>
Nonprofit organizations and religious charities across the country generally provide financial assistance and counseling to single parents. They should visit the local office of known institutions to find out which programs can help them get out of financial hardship. Organizations such as Bridge of Hope and Helping Hands are always willing to help single moms with their housing needs. They also provide educational training when necessary.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Habitat for Humanity work nationwide to help single parents as well. This organization helps struggling families find temporary homes and purchase affordable homes. Applicants partner up with the foundation to build and improve homes in their community, often working for hundreds of hours alongside other volunteers. In return, they gain access to affordable mortgage loans to pay for the home they helped build.

The organization also provides second-hand furniture through their ReStore branches. Goodwill, the Salvation Army and St. Vincent de Paul Society all operate thrift shops with the purpose of helping single parents buy goods at a much lower cost. Some nonprofit organize themselves around providing basic access to a car. Working Class for Families and New Leaf Services have set up programs that donate vehicles to families who need them  most. They also provide financial assistance with vehicle maintenance and repairs.
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
To combat rising costs of basic services, some institutions have established programs that provide services at an affordable price or free. For example, churches may provide free daycare service, food, or financial help to cover basic expenses. Contact your church for information on which assistance programs they operate that might help you get financial relief.

<h3>Child Support</h3>
Single parents have the right to receive child support. Even if you never married, parents have responsibility to pay child support until children is no longer a minor (unless it has special needs), joins the military, they are adopted by a stepmother or stepfather, or are declared to be self-sufficient.

Child support payments are mandatory in all states. The amount of money you’ll receive from the other parent depends on several factors and varies widely between states. The income level, expenses of the parents and needs of the child are important when determining child support payments.

Keep in mind that child support payments are only available as long as you remain a single parent and the child meets the criteria outlined above. However, single parents should always file for child support. Doing so may be necessary to receive the benefits of some federal assistance programs.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Federal Programs</h3>
The federal government runs several assistance programs designed to help struggling families. Single parents can take advantage of them to make sure their children are healthy. For example, single-income households can sign up for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or Food Stamps, to receive financial aid when purchasing food.

However, single parents participating in SNAP must agree to a minimum number of hours of work, school or professional training. Contact a local department of children and families to find requirements for programs in your area.

Single parents without jobs can apply for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The requirements to receive the benefits are similar to two-income families, though single moms and dads must work at least 30 hours per week.

The average national annual income of single parents means that most are usually eligible for Medicaid, which offers help with medical costs. Pregnant women and children are usually automatically eligible for Medicaid. With these resources, single parents, especially single women, are guaranteed some sort of healthcare benefits.

Today, more than 25% of children in America are growing up in single-income houses. State childcare programs such as Early Start, Head Start, and Pre-K provide assistance so single parents can remain in the workforce.

For working single parents, finding basic child care programs to look after children can cost as much as $15,000 a year, which may be out of reach for a single-income household. To address this concern, some states have established childcare centers which provide free childcare services to single moms and dads living in the area.

Family Child Care Homes also have special rates and discounts for single parents. The local Social Security office can provide information about benefits available in that state, as well as requirements to receive them.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Tax Breaks</h3>
Single parents have access to a variety of tax breaks designed to help them save money while raising their children. One of the most popular tax incentives is the childcare tax credit, which single-income households can use to save money on daycare services.

As head of a family, they can also claim a $1,000 tax credit if they claim a child as under their responsibility. However, they must be within the income requirements. This tax break can only be claimed when children are younger than 16 years old.

Tax breaks often are a financial relief for single parents. Failing to cover child support payments are severe, and getting to keep money otherwise spent in taxes can go a long way to help single-income households stay afloat. Parents should always check with state and federal authorities about which tax breaks are available to them.

For single parents, taking advantage of assistance programs can help you save hundreds of dollars on basic expenses. If you are not eligible for benefits, be sure to check back later as these requirements can fluctuate from year to year across states. There are many local agencies and organizations willing to help you get through parenthood successfully.","Since the 1960s, the number of single parents in America continues to rise. As of 2016, more than 13 million households in the country are made of single moms and dads who often do not earn enough money to cover basic expenses.","2018-07-03 21:08:30",post,https://spaoa.org/financial-help-for-single-moms-and-dads/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/child-help-main.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/single-parent-help.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/single-parent-programs.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/child-support-2.jpg,child-help-main.jpg|single-parent-help.jpg|single-parent-programs.jpg|child-support-2.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/child-help-main.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/single-parent-help.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/single-parent-programs.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/child-support-2.jpg,2501|2502|2503|2504,child-help-main|single-parent-help|single-parent-programs|child-support-2,|||,|||,|||,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/child-help-main.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,financial-help-for-single-moms-and-dads,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:04:05"
2505,"Why Set Up A Life Insurance Trust","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Yet over 60 percent of single parents in the country remain uninsured. Those who do are often unaware that children cannot receive money from an insurance company.

If an unexpected death takes place, part of the money will be spent in court appointing a custodian. This can be avoided by setting up a life insurance trust. In this article, we discuss what is a trust, how to set it up and things to consider along the process.

<h3>Single parents must be careful when choosing the beneficiary of a life insurance policy</h3>
Life insurance policies require a beneficiary, which is a person or legal entity designated to receive the money when the insured party dies. Married couples often choose the other parent as beneficiary when purchasing individual life insurance policies.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

This arrangement does not work for single parents. A common mistake made by single parents is to name their children as beneficiaries. However, if their children are underage they will not be able to claim the payout.

Instead, a court will have to appoint a custodian to manage the money until they reach adulthood. This process takes time and is very expensive, reducing the amount of money available to their children.

The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, known as UTMA, was designed to address this problem. The legislation allows parents to name an adult custodian to manage the money until the surviving children reach adulthood.

Most insurance companies allow policyholders to set up a UTMA account and name a custodian when buying a policy. However, this solution doesn't work for single parents without immediate relatives whom they can trust to manage their children's inheritance.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h3>Life insurance trusts have many advantages, and choosing the right type is an important step</h3>
Single parents with life insurance policies worth less than $50,000 might consider it unnecessary to set up a trust. However, parents with higher coverage amounts can take advantage of a trust to responsibly manage their children’s future.

The main advantage of a trust over systems like UTMA is that it allows parents to determine how insurance money will be spent. There is no need for a custodian, and the children will save money otherwise spent in court costs and attorney fees.

Life insurance trusts can be revocable or irrevocable. Revocable trusts can be modified or closed during a parent’s lifetime. Irrevocable trusts are untouchable once set up. People with considerable wealth prefer irrevocable trusts as they protect money from estate taxes.

Most families use revocable trusts because of their flexibility. If the trust is no longer needed, the family can reclaim the money.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Parents whose children have a disability may want to set up a special needs trust. To qualify for government assistance, disabled children cannot have more than $2,000 in assets to their name. A special needs trust is not counted towards the threshold.

As a result, single parents can put life insurance money into a special needs trust named to their children without losing access to critical services such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income.

Attorneys like Scott Malin of Lathrop &amp; Gage LLP agree that parents with minor children should always set up a trust. Life insurance is an important resource when protecting the future of children, but a mismanaged policy contract can put their financial safety at risk. Getting professional advice to set up the most efficient life insurance trust is an important step to guarantee that children are prepared if an unexpected death takes place.","Life insurance is an important resource working parents have to give their children the financial protection they need.","2018-08-22 20:01:32",post,https://spaoa.org/why-single-parents-should-set-up-a-life-insurance-trust/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust01.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust02.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust03.jpg,InsuranceTrust01.jpg|InsuranceTrust02.jpg|InsuranceTrust03.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust01.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust02.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust03.jpg,2506|2507|2508,InsuranceTrust01|InsuranceTrust02|InsuranceTrust03,||,||,||,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/InsuranceTrust01.jpg,"Financial Help",Family,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,why-single-parents-should-set-up-a-life-insurance-trust,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-19 13:25:42"

Raising a child as a single parent can be expensive. Many single-income families are struggling to guarantee their children a future without financial hardship. Although $300 a year may seem like a large number for many single parents, protecting the future of their children with a life insurance policy makes it worth the trouble.","Life insurance is an important financial safeguard for single parents raising children on their own.","2018-08-24 19:48:30",post,https://spaoa.org/life-insurance-for-single-parents-2/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singleMom01.jpg,singleMom01.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singleMom01.jpg,2510,singleMom01,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/singleMom01.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,life-insurance-for-single-parents-2,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:54:34"
2511,"Annuities Guide For Single Parents","They are exposed to the risk of losing their income and falling into hardship. A dependable annuity can be one important part of a plan to avoid a financial crisis.

[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Annuity contracts are offered by insurance companies to help families safeguard their future. They guarantee a steady cash flow, especially when the parent loses their job. In this article, we discuss the basics about annuities, the difference between them and other forms of savings.

<h3>Annuities are financial products which offer families the opportunity to protect their future</h3>
Annuities are used by many individuals to secure a source of income during retirement, protecting a minimum source of cash flow. In most cases, the money comes from payments the individual makes to the insurance company.

This process, known as the accumulation phase, can be completed over time through scheduled payments or by making a single lump sum deposit. People who receive large sums of money from a settlement or perhaps won the lottery can buy an annuity contract to turn their earnings into steady cash flow.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Once the accumulation phase is complete, insurance companies start making periodic payments to contract owners in a process known as annuitization. How long payments are set to last is established when the annuity contract is made.

For example, individuals can choose to receive payments for a fixed amount of time, or for as long as the contract owner is alive. Annuities that pay retirees until they die are known as life guaranteed contracts. Defined benefit pensions and Social Security are two popular examples of life guaranteed annuities.

In general, annuities can be categorized into fixed and variable contracts. Fixed contracts provide a regular amount of money to the annuitant. For example, a 10-year fixed annuity with a $50,000 accumulated investment and 3 percent annual growth rate will pay out around $500 each month.

In a variable contract, annuitants allow insurance companies to invest the accumulated money in their name, receiving larger payments if investments do well and smaller payouts otherwise.

Variable contracts offer the chance to grow investment but at higher risk. However, they are more flexible than fixed contracts, which cannot be modified and have significant penalties if the contract owner decides to withdraw the money ahead of schedule. Some insurance companies allow annuitants to modify their variable contracts to create hybrid fixed-variable annuities.

These contracts often include benefits such as guaranteed minimum payments if the accumulated investment loses value or the option to accelerate payments when the contract owner is diagnosed with a terminal disease.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Annuities differ from other forms of investment and retirement saving plans in significant ways</h3>
&nbsp;

Annuities are more similar to life insurance policies than other forms of retirement savings plans. With the exception of contracts made with lump sums of money, fixed annuities and life insurance policies work in a similar fashion: policyholders pay monthly premiums in exchange for an amount of money to be paid at a later date or under certain circumstances.

This arrangement makes annuity contracts different from other retirement saving options such as 401(k) and individual retirement accounts (IRA). The main difference is that annuity contracts can be purchased by anyone, whereas a 401(k) or IRA is only available to company employees.

Annuity contracts have no limits on how much money can be invested annually. Standard retirement accounts such as 401(k) have an annual limit of $18,500 for people under 50 years old, and $24,500 for folks 50 or older. However, both options allow investors to defer tax payments.

When people withdraw money from a 401(k) account, the entire amount is taxable. In contrast, annuitants only have to pay taxes on investment gains, given that the original investment was made with after-tax money. Both retirement options include penalties for early withdrawals.

Investors younger than 59 ½ years old are usually charged an extra 10 percent when withdrawing money. However, insurance companies only penalize annuitants’ investment gains, whereas 401(k) holders are charged based on the entire withdrawal.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Single income families can take advantage of annuities when, for example, other retirement plans have been exhausted</h3>

The first advantage of annuity contracts is that they can be purchased by anyone. Families who have exhausted other retirement options such as 401(k) can put excess money into an annuity contract, deferring taxes and increasing their retirement savings.

Single income families in particular can take advantage of annuity contracts to have a safeguard if they lose their only income source. The ability to withdraw money without a significant penalty gives single parents some relief when protecting their children from financial hardship.

If you are looking for ways to guarantee a future without financial difficulties, annuities may be a good option. Although resources like a 401(k) and IRA are often the first step on the road to retirement, some families do not have access or already exhausted their saving capacity. Annuity contracts offer a reliable alternative for single income families looking for an additional layer of protection against financial hardship.","A significant number of households rely on a single income source to cover expenses.","2018-08-30 19:35:19",post,https://spaoa.org/what-are-annuities-and-how-can-they-help-single-income-families/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Annuities01.jpg,Annuities01.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Annuities01.jpg,2512,Annuities01,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Annuities01.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,what-are-annuities-and-how-can-they-help-single-income-families,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:54:31"

2519,"How Online Savings Accounts Work","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

However, widespread internet access has created new alternatives to get better returns from your savings. Online savings accounts are one potential alternative, offering customers up to 5 percent in annual interest.

Online savings accounts are operated by virtual financial institutions known as direct banks. Online savings accounts provide a much higher return on investment on par with money market accounts. However, they operate under different rules compared to traditional brick and mortar banks. In this article, we discuss how online savings accounts work, and what to keep in mind when choosing <a href=""https://spaoa.org/stop-paying-banks-fees/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the best online bank to store your money</a>.

<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3><strong>Online and Traditional savings accounts have some similarities, but the nature of the banks create some unique differences</strong></h3>
There are some key differences between standard savings accounts and their online counterparts. Traditional savings accounts have all of the standard benefits offered by brick and mortar institutions.

For example, customers can visit a local office to deposit or withdraw money directly from their savings account or make use of the extensive ATM network without expensive fees. Holders of traditional savings accounts have access to online banking systems but don’t have to worry about passwords to check statements.

However, these benefits come at the cost of a low annual percentage yield (APY) of about 0.5%. Most customers don’t rely on savings accounts to handle investments due to the low APY, preferring other financial products instead. Holders of traditional savings accounts also have to worry about the monthly fee banks charge if savings fall below $500.

Online savings accounts don’t have the same features as their standard counterparts, such as free access to the ATM network and withdrawals from physical offices. Instead, customers have to transfer money from standard savings accounts to online accounts, or mail the bank a check. Some online banks partner with standard ones in order to offer customers ATM access, though they often come with a withdrawal fee.

The main benefit of online savings accounts is the high annual percentage yield (APY). Most online banks offer customers up to 5% on their savings accounts. This APY is on par with that offered by money market accounts, making online banks an attractive option for long-term investments.

Online banks are able to offer higher returns and fewer fees because they don’t have to spend money on maintaining infrastructure and personnel like traditional banks.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Online bank customers have the option to access the bank whenever they need it. The bank’s operations are not limited by the working hours of an office, providing permanent customer support to account holders. Statements and other financial data can be viewed online from a computer or smartphone. Online savings account holders don’t have to wait for statements to arrive via mail.

Products such as debit and credit cards can be requested on the website. There is no need to visit an office and submit physical papers. Some online banks do require customers to mail documents to their central office, although they can often be scanned and uploaded instead.

One potential downside of online savings accounts is their reliance on an internet connection. Customers who find themselves without internet may lose access to the platform.
<h3>Opening an online savings account only takes several easy steps</h3>
Opening an online savings account is easier than applying for a traditional one. Banks like HSBC, Virtual Bank, and ING Direct operate a straightforward process for customers to open an online savings account. However, some may require customers to scan and upload some documents or send them by mail to the bank’s central offices.

To open an online savings account, customers have to visit the bank’s website. Most banks’ websites have the option to open an account at the landing page, along with information about the financial products they offer.

After the ""open account"" option has been chosen, customers must complete an online application form with their personal information. Some online banks like HSBC allow customers to send the required documentation via mail and let the personnel handle the rest.

In general, online banks need the following documentation to open a savings account: address, phone number, date of birth, Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number, and a government-issued identification document like a driver’s license.

Online banks also ask customers to create a user account during the application process. This includes selecting a username and password. For additional protection, banks often include additional verification processes such as two-step verification or security questions.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Online banks will ask customers to link their newly created savings account to a traditional savings or checking account. This step gives customers the ability to transfer money between their accounts. Some banks such as ING Direct perform a security check during this process to make sure the customer has access or control over the traditional account that is being linked.

This security check usually involves a small deposit made by the online bank to the savings account. The deposit amount is not revealed to the customer until they verify the account transactions and provide it back to the bank.

One the verification process is complete, the online savings account becomes operational and ready to use. Unlike traditional financial institutions, online banks only ask for a very small minimum deposit to open a savings account, and there are no maintenance fees regardless of how much money is stored.

<h3>There are some things customers have to consider before opening an online savings account</h3>
Customers who are interested in opening an online savings account should keep several things in mind. First, not all online banks offer the same benefits to potential customers. For example, one online bank may advertise an annual percentage yield of about 5%, which is good for long-term investment.

However, this APY might only be an introductory rate, falling to a less attractive 2% after several months. Customers should consult the fine print to understand how much money they will actually make by depositing their savings with a specific online bank.

Another important factor is whether the bank has a customer service department people can talk to when necessary. Not all online financial institutions operate call centers. Some online banks are small and prefer to address customer concerns via email.

Although most online banks have eliminated fees and service charges, customers should always make sure they are aware of any potential costs before choosing an online bank. In general, online banks only inform customers about ATM withdrawal fees.

Online banks are a growing industry with only a few years in existence. As a result, online banking remains unregulated in some areas. Customers have to keep that in mind when opening an online savings account, as not all online banks are legitimate businesses. To safeguard their money, people should look only for banks that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, or FDIC. If they are, their money will be protected by the government.","Around 40 percent of families have at least $1,000 in savings.

2521,"5 Ways Single Moms Can Afford Childcare","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Unsurprisingly, childcare services can easily outweigh major items on the budget such as college tuition, food, transportation and the cost of housing.

Here are a couple of ways single moms can afford childcare services:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h2>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</h2>
This program provides needy families with grant funds to both states and territories within the U.S. These funds provide such families with childcare assistance, work assistance, and job preparation. So as to get the best from this program, you should:
<ul>
 	<li>Either be pregnant or have a young one under the age of 19.</li>
 	<li>Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or legal alien</li>
 	<li>Earn a very low income ( less than $784/month) along with countable assets of below $1,000.</li>
 	<li>Be under-employed</li>
 	<li>Accept and apply for other benefits such as SSI ( Supplemental Security Insurance), Workman’s Compensation, Child Support, Unemployment Compensation etc.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h2>State-funded prekindergarten</h2>
These sort of programs basically focus on school readiness and early education. A few states offer their services at little or no cost to eligible single moms. If you wish to find out whether or not this program is available in your locale, be sure to contact your state child care resource and referral agency.
<h2>Child Care Vouchers (Otherwise referred to as subsidies or fee assistance)</h2>
Every state in America runs a child care subsidy that is funded by the federal government. The purpose of these programs is to aid low-class families and single moms to pay for expensive childcare. As for the eligibility requirements, they vary from one state to another. These are some of the common guidelines:
<ul>
 	<li>Your child care cost will be catered for by the ELRC. This is what is referred to as subsidy payment.</li>
 	<li>As they assist you to pay, you will also have to cater for a portion of the total cost.</li>
 	<li>The child care program will be the biggest beneficiary as it receives funds from the family co-pay and the subsidy payment.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h2>Child Care Development Fund (CCDF)</h2>
The CCDF seeks to improve child care quality by funding child care for low-income single moms. Apply for this program by contacting the intake agent within your area or visit the nearest CCDF offices. Prior to filing for an application, however, you should:
<ul>
 	<li>Adhere to the income guidelines</li>
 	<li>Have a Department of Child Services or TANF referral</li>
 	<li>Have children who are younger than 12 years (unless they are physically handicapped) and are U.S. citizens.</li>
 	<li>Be a resident of the state you seek to apply in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Head Start/ Early Head Start</h2>
Headstart is a program that assists in the preparation of children between 3-5 years as they start school. Early head start serves infants from birth up to their second year. Both these programs provide additional services that cater to their social, emotional and mental development. Single moms who meet the requirements, the main one being earning insufficient income, qualify for this program.

2523,"Tax Deductions Many Single Parents Miss","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As a single parent, there are tax deductions and credits that you can take advantage. Tax credits actually reduce the total amount of taxes you could have paid to the government. Here are a few ways through which single parents can ease the tax burden:

<h2>File the taxes as the ‘Head of Household’</h2>
When you file your taxes as head of the household as a single parent, you benefit from a lower taxable income along with a higher potential for tax refunds. To qualify for this status, you must:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Demonstrate that you have a biological child, foster child, stepchild or dependent. The child must have lived within the home for more than six months of the tax year.</li>
 	<li>Prove that you are unmarried, that is, single or divorced, for that tax year.</li>
 	<li>Show that you cater to the majority of your household’s expenses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Child Care Credit</h2>
Paying for child care is undoubtedly very expensive, but did you know that there is a tax credit that could help you meet this cost? If you had to pay someone to look after your child as you looked for work, you qualify for this tax credit. You also have to meet the following qualifications:

You must show that you earned an income during the tax year. This implies that if you are between jobs or stay at home, you will not qualify for this tax credit.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<ul>
 	<li>The child must have been under 13 years for at least part of the tax year.</li>
 	<li>The person taking care of the child must not be under your care.</li>
 	<li>The caregiver must not be the other parent.</li>
 	<li>File for a dependent exemption</li>
</ul>
If you filed your taxes as the head of household, you will also be able to claim an exemption for yourself along with that of each qualifying child. This implies that for every exemption, part of your salary won’t be taxed. However, only one parent can claim a child as a dependent when it comes to taxes. Divorced parent with equal custody will, therefore, need to come to an understanding on the same.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h2>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</h2>
This is a tax credit intended to ease the tax burden on low and moderate-income working families. It is an incentive meant to reward and encourage work. Studies indicate that EITC is quite effective as it encourages single parents to seek employment particularly during the times that the labor market is stable. The annual low-income bracket falls between $40,320 and $54,884. The EITC is refundable, which implies that should it exceed the person’s income liability, the IRS could refund the balance.

The tax system might sometimes seem unfair, but taking the time to learn and implement all the breaks available to you will result in you making some savings. If need be, hire the services of a qualified tax pro to point you in the right direction.","Being a single parent is already tough work without the stress that tax time adds.

2528,"Improve Your Finances With A Credit-Builder Loan","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

However, one common question is <a href=""https://spaoa.org/7-tips-to-increase-your-credit-score/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">how to improve a credit score</a> without first getting approved for a standard loan or credit card. Currently, about three out of ten families lack the credit history required to access much-needed financing. So how can this paradox be broken?

Financial institutions have designed several methods people can use to build financial history. One popular and affordable option is to apply for a credit-builder loan. These loans were created to help low-income families improve their financial record.

<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

However, there are some details that must be kept in mind. In this article, we explore what are credit-builder loans and how you can use them to get into a better financial situation.
<h3>What are credit builder loans</h3>
Credit-builder loans were created to help low-income families build or repair their financial history. For this purpose, most financial institutions often refer to them as Fresh Start or Starting Over loans.

Unlike unsecured personal lines of credit, credit-builder loans do not represent a risk to banks who issue them. As a result, financial institutions can offer these loans to customers without a good credit score. Borrowers only have to show proof they can cover monthly payments.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Credit-builder loans are not meant to finance any expenses. Their sole purpose is to help people improve their credit score by registering loan payments with the three major credit bureaus. As a result, most credit-builder loans get approved for small amounts of money to be repaid in several months.

The main downside of credit-builder loans is that they operate with the same interest rates as unsecured lines of credit. As of 2018, most credit-builder loans offered by credit unions and community banks had interest rates of between 7 and 22 percent.

At a maximum of 22 percent, someone paying off a $1,000 credit-builder loan over six months will have to pay $1,110 in total. This means that it would cost them $110 in interest to improve their credit history.
<h3>How credit-builder loans work</h3>
Credit-builder loans work just like a standard unsecured line of credit. Customers submit an application to a financial institution and after a review process, the request gets approved. However, there is one significant difference. When a traditional loan is requested, the bank gives whatever amount was approved directly to customers. In contrast, when a credit-builder loan is approved, the money is withheld by banks until customers have finished paying.

In general, credit-builder loans are approved for small amounts of money, which ranges from $500 to $1,500. Most credit unions and community banks operate repayment periods of around twelve months and interest rates around 17 percent. However, most perform a study of what local residents can afford to guarantee payments. Additionally, some financial institutions give customers with a history of on-time payments the option to be refunded a portion of total interest paid.

Credit builder-loans are one of the most effective ways to improve credit. However, just like traditional loans, customers are required to commit for a long period of time. Impatient customers might prefer faster alternatives such as a secured credit card.
<h3>Where to apply for a credit-builder loan</h3>
Credit-builder loans are generally not offered by large financial institutions. Instead, they are offered by credit unions and community banks in order to help nearby residents get their financial history started. Credit unions often ask customers to acquire a membership and reside in the area before gaining access to their loans. Community banks do not ask for membership but they often only serve local residents.

<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

In some places, local credit unions and community banks do not offer credit-builder loans due to low demand. However, customers might still be able to get one through Community Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs.

These organizations are established to help low-income families improve their credit history, and more than a thousand operate across the country. Online lenders and local groups are also a good way to find credit-builder loans, though customers should make sure payments are reported to credit bureaus before signing up.

For some customers, it may seem too complicated finding a local bank that offers credit-builder loans. However, the payoff is generally worth it, as these institutions are able to offer lower interest rates and generous payment terms.
<h3>Other ways to build or improve credit</h3>
Credit-builder loans have some disadvantages. First, they are hard to find and are approved for low amounts despite maintaining similar interest rates than unsecured loans.

Second, they need months of commitment and other complicated requirements. Families who are not interested in a credit union membership or plan to move soon might have a difficult time taking advantage of credit-builder loans.

For them, other credit-building options are more attractive. For example, secured credit cards are offered by several large financial institutions who operate nationwide. They only require a $50-$200 deposit and do not force customers into long payment periods. However, customers must have the money required to make the deposit.

If the objective is to build credit history through loans, getting a co-signer may be a possible solution. Co-signing requires someone with a high credit score who is willing to be responsible for the entire loan if the borrower is unable to pay.

Parents and family members can take advantage of co-signing to help younger members get financial history without much risk. A similar solution would be granting relatives authorized used status on an existing credit card.

A significant number of families have seen their credit scores improve in recent years. A healthy economy and available options to build and restore credit are among the causes of this development. However, many still remain in financial hardship, without access to much-needed financing. Credit-builder loans are one possible route to overcome these obstacles and improve their financial situation.","To get approved for a loan or credit card, you need a good credit history.","2021-05-26 05:40:31",post,https://spaoa.org/improve-your-finances-with-a-credit-builder-loan/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-builder.jpg,credit-builder.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-builder.jpg,2529,credit-builder,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-builder.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,improve-your-finances-with-a-credit-builder-loan,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-18 14:13:39"
2530,"A Secured Credit Card Can Improve Your Credit Score","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Yet many families have no access to this financial product due to not having a good enough credit score in the first place. People constantly look for a way to end the paradox and enjoy the benefits credit cards offer. One possible solution is to sign up for a secured credit card.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Secured credit cards are available to people with a poor financial history or low credit score. They are supported by a deposit made to protect the financial institution when customers miss a payment. Like their traditional counterparts, secured credit cards help build credit history, improving credit score over time. In this article, we explain what are secured credit cards, the difference between them and other financial products, and how to improve credit score as fast as possible by using a secured credit card.

<h3>What are secured credit cards?</h3>
Standard credit cards operate with a line of credit given to customers by a financial institution. The interest rate and amount of available credit depends on the customer’s financial history and credit score. Secured credit cards do not operate on a line of credit given by a bank.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Instead, customers deposit an amount of money which will be equal to the credit limit. In general, the minimum deposit needed to get a secured credit card is $200, though some banks accept lower deposits. Capital One, for example, gives customers a $200 credit line with a $50 deposit if their financial history is good enough.

The deposit is not consumed when the card is used to purchase goods or services as long as the customer pays their bills. Instead, its purpose is to protect the financial institution if the customer doesn’t pay their bills.

If a delinquency happens, the bank takes money from the deposit to cover payments. This method gives customers with bad financial history access to a line of credit.

If customers pay their bills on time, the deposit remains untouched. Once their credit score is good enough to apply for a standard credit card, customers can close the secured credit card and get back their deposit. Some of the largest banks offer customers a way to upgrade their secured credit cards into a standard one when their financial history has improved.
<h3>The difference between secured and unsecured credit cards</h3>
As we mentioned above, secured credit cards rely on a deposit-backed line of credit to replace the lack of financial history or underwhelming credit score. Instead, banks only issue unsecured credit cards to customers with at least an average credit score to protect themselves from excessive risk. Families with high credit score usually have access to low-interest rate unsecured credit cards.

Some banks give unsecured credit cards to customers with low or no credit history. However, most come with extremely high fees that can ultimately strangle a customer’s ability to pay and improve their financial record. In that case, obtaining a secured credit card would be a much better option, even if it means working with a lower line of credit.
<h3>How secured credit cards work?</h3>
Aside from the initial deposit, secured credit cards are similar to unsecured ones when it comes to purchasing goods and services. Payment platforms generally do not recognize if the credit card is secured or unsecured. In general, banks the line of credit supporting credit cards on their internal platform, which means customers can use secured cards wherever credit is accepted.

This means that credit cards are an efficient way of improving credit scores. Customers can use a secured credit card to handle bill payments and other financial responsibilities. As long as they pay the balance on time, their credit score is guaranteed to rise. Eventually, they will gain access to an unsecured credit card, which increases available credit.

Like unsecured credit cards, secured ones carry interest if the customer carries a balance. The interest rate varies according to the issuing bank. For example, the Digital Federal Credit Union Secured Credit Card has a variable annual percentage rate (APR) of 13.25 percent, while the one offered by OpenSky has an APR of 19.15 percent.

Secured credit cards often come with an annual service fee which can be as much as $50. However, some credit card issuers like Discover It and Capital One charge customers no annual fees.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>The difference between secured credit cards and prepaid debit</h3>
Some customers might think that secured credit cards are the same as a prepaid debit card. However, these financial products have significant differences. Customers who use prepaid debit cards have to put money into them before they can purchase goods and services. Additionally, the payments are made using the money placed into the prepaid card.

In contrast, customers who use secured credit cards are given access to a line of credit backed by a deposit. They can purchase goods and services with money borrowed from the financial institution just like a standard credit card. The deposit protects the bank if the customer is unable to pay.

However, the most important difference is that prepaid debit card transactions are not considered use of credit. As a result, they aren’t reported to credit bureaus and do not help improve credit scores. If the main goal of a customer is to improve their credit score, a secured credit card is a much better alternative than prepaid debit.
<h3>Making the most out of a secured credit card</h3>
Secured credit cards are one of the best tools to rebuild credit. However, to make the most out of a secured credit card, customers should keep a few things in mind. First, customers shouldn’t use their secured credit card excessively. Once or twice a month is enough to create a credit history.

Financial advisors recommend not spending more than half the credit line. They also recommend customers pay their balance every month before the due date. Interest rates on most secured credit cards are relatively high. Paying the balance before it gets processed into monthly payments helps improve credit scores significantly.

In general, customers need around twelve months to improve their credit score and become eligible for an unsecured credit card. Some financial institutions allow customers to upgrade their line of credit into unsecured status, instead of opening a new one. This method is much better for credit scores, as it avoids reporting the closure and opening of a credit account.

Having a good credit score can help families improve their financial environment. Refinancing a mortgage or loan to obtain lower interest rates can be done with a good credit score. Many individuals struggle to find the most efficient way to improve their credit score as quickly as possible.

Secured credit cards are among the best ways to do so. However, customers should follow financially responsible practices or risk lowering their score further.","Having and using a credit card responsibly is the most efficient way of improving a credit score.","2018-12-10 21:28:33",post,https://spaoa.org/a-secured-credit-card-can-improve-your-credit-score/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-score-1.jpg,credit-score-1.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-score-1.jpg,2531,credit-score,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/credit-score-1.jpg,"Financial Help","Help for families",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,a-secured-credit-card-can-improve-your-credit-score,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-18 15:06:10"
2532,"How To Buy A Car With No Down Payment","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A significant number of people do not have enough money saved to cover down payment. Rising vehicle costs have also had an impact on customers’ ability to purchase vehicles.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, many lenders are adapting to this trend. Nowadays, people with optimal financial backgrounds can purchase a vehicle with no down payment. Those with a weak credit history can now rely on family members and relatives to get approved. In this article, we explain how these options work and what to consider along the way.</span>

<h3><b>Benefits of down payment</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Providing down payment has many benefits. First, it lowers monthly payments, interest rates and loan terms. For example, a family who wants to purchase a $30,000 car agrees to provide 20 percent as down payment, or $6,000. As a result, lenders only have to approve a $24,000 loan to cover the difference. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because they provided $6,000 as down payment, the family gets a prime rate of 4.7% with a loan term of 48 months. Their monthly payment will be around $550. If they choose a loan term of 60 months, their monthly payments would decrease to around $450. The family would pay $2,400 in interest, bringing the total purchase cost to $32,400.</span>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, customers who provide less or no money as down payment are offered different terms. In most cases, they must accept higher interest rates and loan terms. Using the example above, customers would need a $30,000 loan to complete the purchase. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Customers who do not provide down payment often get interest rates as high as 12 percent, to be paid back in 60 or 84 months. Choosing 72 months would make monthly payments be at around $550. However, total interest paid would be almost $13,000, bringing the total purchase cost to $43,000.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A survey from Edmunds.com reveals that, on average, most people provide around 10 percent down payment. The main reason why customers are not putting down 20 percent is because of rising vehicle costs. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, interest rates have decreased from 9 percent during the 1990s to only 4.5 percent by the end of 2018, offsetting some of the additional cost. To keep monthly payments in check, families have chosen longer loan terms too. As of 2017, the average car loan term was 68 months.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, providing down payment is not the only way to get the best rates. Many lenders are willing to sell vehicles with no down payment as long as customers meet certain requirements. For example, having a high enough credit score, or having someone co-sign the car loan.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h2><b>Have a credit score around 550 and 680</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People with high enough credit scores often have access to new vehicles with no down payment and generous interest rates. In general, most lenders offer this option to customers with credit scores at or above 680. People with scores between 550 and 680 may still be able to waive down payment, but at the cost of higher interest rates. Customers with credit scores below 550 are often not approved by lenders without 20 percent down payment.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those who have low credit scores can use several strategies to raise it. A credit score is a numerical value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual. It is compiled by analyzing a person's financial history, including past credit reports and monthly payments. Improving credit scores takes time. The lower a credit score is, the longer it will take to raise it. However, there are some effective strategies to improve a credit score in 6 to 12 months.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first step requires paying bills on time. Late payments have a substantial impact on a credit score, and must be avoided at all costs. Taking a payday loan can be a potential solution to address upcoming bills, especially when the paycheck is still far ahead. Paying bills on time is important because most financial institutions consider payment history as an accurate predictor of whether a person can be trusted to honor future payments.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second step involves reducing outstanding debt. However, people should try and focus on reducing credit card debt first, as it usually has the highest interest rates. Reducing credit card debt improves the credit utilization ratio, a number that represents how much money customers have borrowed compared to available credit. For example, someone who has borrowed $20,000 across all credit cards will have a credit utilization ratio of 0.33 if their total available credit equals $60,000.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Credit utilization ratio only includes credit card debt. Other debt accounts such as mortgages and student loans have no effect on it. However, financial advisors recommend against closing credit accounts even if they have been fully paid, as doing so can lower credit scores.</span>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Following those steps, a person can raise their credit score significantly in less than twelve months. It may take less if the goal was to raise a credit score from 540 to 600 points, which would be enough to waive down payment when purchasing a new vehicle.</span>
<h3><b>Ask your spouse, a family member or relative to become co-signer</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In many cases, purchasing a vehicle is a family decision. If a person does not have a good enough credit score to waive down payment on their own, they can rely on family members to get over the threshold. The family member then becomes a co-signer, co-borrower or co-applicant of the car loan. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Which name financial institutions give to the second person depends on who they are. Also, this method is only effective if the second person’s credit score is high enough to raise their combined score at or above 600 points.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the second person is a spouse or partner, lenders usually refer to them as co-borrowers. Their income, assets and credit history will be considered as part of the loan application. They are equally responsible for monthly payments and usually share ownership of the vehicle.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the second person is a relative, friend or family member other than the spouse, lenders refer to them as co-applicants. The only difference, in this case, is that, due to not being married or in a partnership, lenders will analyze their financial history separately. If consumers want to maintain sole ownership of the vehicle, they can rely on a co-signer instead. Co-signers do not share vehicle ownership while still being responsible for monthly payments.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best way to waive down payment without facing significant interest rate raises is by adding a spouse or long-term partner to the loan application. Using someone else, such as a family member or relative may help customers waive down payment, but at the cost of higher interest rates. However, in both cases, the final loan agreement will be more flexible than what lenders would offer without extra financial support.</span>","A down payment is among the list of requirements to purchase a new vehicle.","2019-01-17 15:49:27",post,https://spaoa.org/how-to-buy-a-car-with-no-down-payment/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buying-car.jpg,buying-car.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buying-car.jpg,2533,buying-car,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buying-car.jpg,"Financial Help","Help for families",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,how-to-buy-a-car-with-no-down-payment,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-19 13:07:04"
2534,"Stop Giving Banks $500 in Fees Each Year, Here's How","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The number of fees charged by traditional banks is growing. In 2017 alone, customers paid over $35 billion in bank fees. That includes overdrafts, maintenance and minimum balance fees. On average, account holders pay around $250 each year on bank fees.

Most bank fees can be avoided under certain circumstances. Some might require having more money on your account, while others can only be sidestepped by switching to a different bank. In this article, we talk about five expensive fees most banks charge and how they can be avoided.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3><strong>Save $200 each year in overdraft fees</strong></h3>
Overdraft and Insufficient Funds (NSF) fees happen when customers try to spend more money than what is available in their accounts. For example, if a person has $100 in their account but spends $115 with their debit card, banks will charge a fee to provide the difference.

Overdrafts are among the most expensive fees charged by banks. On average, banks charge between $30 and $35 per overdraft incident. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, consumers paid over $15 billion in overdraft fees alone during 2017. The Bureau also reported that the average consumer overdrafts their account by $24.

Several bank advocacy groups such as the Consumer Bankers Association have promoted new regulation to control overdraft fees. However, the Federal Reserve already made overdraft fees optional in 2010, which complicates the path to any new regulation.

In general, and since 2010, most banks only charge overdraft fees to customers who have signed up for overdraft protection. Otherwise, their debit card will be declined without generating any fee.

However, some banks still add this service automatically. Because overdraft fees are optional, the best way to avoid them is by not signing up to an overdraft protection program. Consulting banks to make sure such a program is not activated without permission might be necessary.

Some banks offer overdraft lines of credit instead, which charge interest instead of a flat fee. Others will automatically transfer money between accounts to cover the difference. However, this money transfer service can cost $10 per transfer.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Close your account properly and don't pay while doing it</h3>
Opening a checking or savings account in a brick and mortar bank may require a minimum deposit. Some institutions ask for only one dollar, while others have higher minimums. Although the minimum deposit is not a fee, it represents a barrier to open an account. However, online banks now exist and most require no minimum deposit.

Closing an account is a different story. Some banks charge customers an early account closure fee if they close their accounts before a certain period of time has passed. This period can last for a few weeks or several months.

For example, Citibank charges customers a $25 fee if they close their accounts within 90 days of opening it. HSBC and PNC Bank charge customers if the account is closed before 180 days have elapsed.

Odysseas Papadimitrou from CardHub.com explains that most banks establish early account closure fees as a way to discourage account holders from leaving. According to him, customers are less likely to migrate to a different bank after 90 or 180 days. In contrast, Nessa Feddis from the American Bankers Association argues that banks use early account closure fees to recover the cost of opening and closing accounts.

There are two ways customers can avoid an account closure fee. They can keep their accounts open until the minimum period is over, then close it. Or they can look for banks that have no early account closure fees. A potential alternative would be switching to an online bank account.
<h3><strong>Get your bank statements online and save money on paper fees</strong></h3>
A survey from CreditCards.com revealed that over 54 percent of account holders still receive their statements on paper. Another key finding was that 46 percent would not switch to digital statements even if they were charged a fee.

What they might not know is that most banks already charge a paper statement fee. However, it is not as high as early account closure or overdraft fee, as banks only charge up to $3 each month. For example, U.S. Bank charges $2 per month on some of its checking accounts.

Someone without easy access to online banking might find it okay to pay around $50 annually to receive paper statements. However, low-income families and individuals might want to cut unnecessary spending as much as possible.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Also, as Ms. Feddis reports, most banks use paper statement fees to try and convince customers to switch to digital delivery. Postage prices have gone up in recent years, which means banks have been sending paper statements at a loss.

Another method used by some banks to encourage the switch is offering discounts on account maintenance fees. For example, TD Banks offers a $1 discount to users who have chosen to receive electronic statements through email. The discount applies to all checking, savings and money market accounts offered by the financial institution.

Switching to electronic statements is the most immediate way of avoiding this fee. However, some banks do offer paper statements with no additional cost, though they may require a minimum balance.
<h3><strong>Stop paying for account maintenance and save $300</strong></h3>
The American Bankers Association estimates that it costs between $250 and $400 each year to maintain a checking account. Most financial institutions fund part of that money by charging customers an account maintenance fee.

For example, Bank of America charges $12 each month on its regular checking accounts. This totals $144 a year, reducing the bank's maintenance costs by almost fifty percent.

Account maintenance fees vary according to the bank. According to a survey from MoneyRates.com, the average customer pays $13.51 each month in account maintenance fees.

Some customers reported paying as much as $300 a year in such fees. However, the survey also found that almost 32 percent of all checking accounts have no maintenance fees at all.

Choosing a free checking account is one way of avoiding maintenance fees. However, customers who prefer to stick to their bank can avoid the fee by meeting certain requirements.

For example, Bank of America customers can avoid the fee by making a direct deposit of $250 each month or $3,000 per year. They can also waive the fee if their minimum daily balance is above $1,500. Most banks have similar requirements, which can be consulted in the checking account's policy.
<h3><strong>Put some money in your account and avoid a balance fee</strong></h3>
Customers with low account balances are often charged more than just account maintenance fees. Most banks also charge a monthly minimum balance fee to customers who fall below certain balance requirements. For example, Citibank charges $15 each month to customers who maintain less than $6,000 in their checking accounts.

Smaller banks often have lower balance requirements and fee amounts. For example, Warren-Boynton State Bank charges $10 unless customers maintain a minimum daily balance of $1,500, or if they average $3,000 during the month.

Some customers often think minimum balance and account maintenance fees are the same. However, a person who owns a checking account can be charged both fees in a month if they fail to make a direct deposit or meet minimum balance requirements.

Minimum balance fees are another method used by banks to recoup some of the costs of maintaining account services. A recent survey by MagnifyMoney showed that median account balance among households was close to $5,000.

It also revealed that almost 29 percent of account holders have less than $1,000 saved. This means a significant number of account owners are subject to minimum balance fees.

There are several ways people can avoid minimum balance fees. First, they can meet their bank's minimum balance requirements. However, studies have shown that most households struggle to meet those thresholds.

Second, they can switch to a bank that offers more flexible requirements or has no minimum balance fees at all. Online banks are a potential solution, as most charge no maintenance or balance fees.","Banks use countless tricks to take money away from you.

2536,"Transfer Your Credit Card Balance And Save $1,000","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Credit card debt has one of the highest interest rates in the market. In 2018, households paid an average 25 percent interest on their credit cards. Given that the average consumer owes around $16,000 in credit card debt, according to NerdWallet, such a high rate often means families have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest alone.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a way to avoid paying interest on credit card debt. This process, called a balance transfer, allows people to pay zero percent interest on their credit card debt for several months or years. However, as credit card debt rises, the number of balance transfer credit cards have decreased. Here’s everything you need to know about balance transfers and how they work.</span>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3><b>What Is a Balance Transfer?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A balance transfer is the partial or full transfer of debt between one account to another, often held by a different financial institution. Balance transfers are often offered by banks and credit card companies as a way to attract new customers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most common way of performing a balance transfer is by applying for a new credit card which includes this feature. Most balance transfer credit cards come with low or no interest charged on the transferred debt, albeit only for a specified period. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Customers who perform a balance transfer must pay a fee to the target financial institution. In most cases, this fee can either be a flat number or a percentage of the amount being transferred. However, financial institutions often have a minimum fee for balance transfers below a certain amount. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, Citi’s Simplicity Card has a balance transfer fee that equals 5 percent of the amount per transfer. However, if customers transfer less than $100, they will pay a $5 flat fee.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The benefits financial institutions make available to customers who perform balance transfers depend on their creditworthiness. For example, Citi’s Simplicity and Double Cash credit cards offer customers a zero percent interest rate on balance transfers for 18 to 21 months. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Balance transfers must be completed within 4 months of account opening. Otherwise, customers must pay between 16 and 26 percent annual interest rate. Bank of America’s BankAmericard also offers zero percent interest rate for 18 months, but balance transfers must be completed within 60 days instead of 4 months. </span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Balance transfer credit cards with zero percent APR for extensive periods are usually available to customers with credit scores above 680. If someone has a credit score between 580 and 679, financial institutions may offer the same benefits but for shorter periods. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, Aspire, a federal credit union, offers a Platinum Mastercard with a zero percent interest rate on balance transfers for 6 months. After that, customers must pay interest between 8 and 18 percent, according to their credit history.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Balance transfers made to existing debt accounts often have less attractive benefits. Using the credit cards in the above example, a customer would have to pay between 8 and 26 percent annual interest rate on balance transfers made after the specified grace period. However, performing a balance transfer is such a scenario would make sense if the target credit card is part of a rewards program.</span>
<h3><b>Why Transfer Your Balance?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people perform a balance transfer to save money they would otherwise pay on interest. For example, an individual has a $3,000 balance on their current credit card, with a 19 percent annual interest rate. To pay off the entire balance in 18 months, they would have to make monthly payments of $192, totaling $3,456. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If they transfer the balance to a new credit card with zero percent interest for 18 months, their monthly payments would fall to $167. If the credit card issuer has a 3 percent balance fee, the total amount paid would be $90, much lower than the $456 paid in interest. By performing a balance transfer, the individual saved $366.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another reason why people do balance transfers is to consolidate debt into a single credit card. Aside from helping save money on interest, debt consolidation helps people keep track of less individual bills. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is not uncommon for credit cards to have different due dates. By moving all outstanding balance to a single card, consumers can organize their finances more efficiently and understand how much debt they have.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Financial institutions do not impose limits on how many balance transfers can be performed by consumers. Instead, they limit the period in which customers can transfer and pay no interest rate on incoming balances. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This means someone with outstanding debt on three or four credit cards can consolidate all their balance into a single new card and save money on zero percent interest promotions. Once the zero interest period is over, consumers can then request another card with a fresh promotion, transfer any remaining balance, and continue enjoying the benefits.</span>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3><b>How Balance Transfers Work</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before a balance transfer can be performed, consumers must first compare available offers and choose one that best suits their needs. Then, they must submit an application for the credit card. The application process can be completed online or through a phone call. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most financial institutions ask for contact information, social security number, and annual income. Applications for balance transfer credit cards also request creditor names and account numbers needed to complete the transfers.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not all banks ask for creditor name and account numbers when customers submit an application. Nowadays, most credit cards come with some form of balance transfer promotion, so customers can submit relevant information later if they desire to take advantage of the service. However, as explained above, customers must keep in mind the period financial institutions give to receive promotional interest rates.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once an application is approved, the target financial institution will perform a balance transfer according to the credit limit given to customers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, a customer requested a balance transfer for $6,000 but the bank only approved a credit limit of $4,500. In this case, the financial institution will perform a balance transfer for $4,500. The difference, $1,500, will remain in the old credit card. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The balance transfer is complete once a financial institution confirms payment has been made. In general, banks inform customers by sending a statement that also includes the new monthly payment amount and due date. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Customers should be aware that some financial institutions may still issue one more statement charging residual interest after a balance transfer is complete. This last statement must be paid even if no outstanding balance is left. Otherwise, customers may have their credit scores negatively affected.  </span>
<h3><b>How To Qualify For a Balance Transfer Credit Card</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Credit cards that come with promotional interest rates for balance transfers often have strict requirements. Most financial institutions, like Citi or Bank of America, require credit scores above 680 points before approving a balance transfer credit card. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They also often ask for no more than two hard credit inquiries in the last six months. Customers who apply for balance transfers must also not have maxed out their other credit cards.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People with scores between 580 and 680 can still get approved for a balance transfer credit card. However, only small banks and credit unions offer 0 percent interest rate promotions to these customers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If a customer has a score below 580, they will most likely not be approved for a balance transfer credit card. In such cases, it would be a good idea to improve their credit score before applying for one. This is because credit card applications often register a hard inquiry on a person’s credit history.</span>","A simple balance transfer can save you thousands of dollars on interest.

2538,"How To Get $1,750 A Month In Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you think government welfare programs are just for lazy people, think again. More than 20 percent of Americans participate in one of the major welfare programs like food assistance or medicaid, according to the most recent U.S. Census.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">People enroll in these programs during financial difficulty, and those  who receive government assistance often escape hardship faster than those who have no help at all. With a full slate of benefits, a recipient could earn well over $1,750 each month in support.</span>
<h3><b>$800 per month in unemployment benefits while looking for work</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Working adults who lose their jobs have access to unemployment benefits provided by the federal government. Such benefits are available in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. </span>
<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unemployment benefits are managed in each state by a local unemployment insurance program, which determines who receives money and how much money can be awarded each month. In general, the amount of money provided through unemployment benefits will vary according to state. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In high-income states such as Massachusetts, eligible workers can receive up to $800 per month in unemployment benefits. In contrast, Mississippi awards eligible workers around $300 per month.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unemployment insurance programs are managed by state governments, which are responsible for processing applications and paying eligible workers. The money comes from state and federal payroll taxes paid by local residents who are employed. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In general, unemployment benefits are only available to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Workers who were fired for misconduct are not eligible for the program. </span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many states take out-of-work behavior into consideration. Committing a crime or a felony, for example, is usually a valid reason not to award unemployment benefits. How long people remain ineligible varies by state. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unemployment benefits are classified as a type of financial assistance or social welfare benefit. As a result, beneficiaries must add any money received through unemployment benefits to their gross income when filing their tax returns or applying for a mortgage or unsecured loan. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unemployment benefits last for six months after being approved. Workers who still meet the requirements after the period has elapsed can renew the benefits several times. Contact your local unemployment insurance agency to find more information. </span>
<h3><b>$100 per month to pay utility bills</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Families going through financial hardship often have difficulty paying their utility bills. To help them, the government has created a program called Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP). </span>
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through this program, households can receive up to $100 each month to cover their utility bills. The program also offers financial assistance if an emergency happens and funds to make energy-efficient home improvements. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In total, families can receive up to $1,200 each year to cover energy bills. How much money is awarded will depend on several factors, including gross annual income, number of people in the household, and the size of the house. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In general, the rule is that households cover 20 percent of their utility bills while the government takes care of the remaining 80 percent. Some states restrict assistance to only one type of energy, which means the money might not be available to cover all utilities.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to receive the LIHEAP benefits, a family must provide sufficient proof that they require financial help to cover the basic costs of powering their home. In general, a family of three must have a combined annual income of less than $30,000 to be eligible. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, some states have expanded the eligibility criteria to fit families who need help but do not qualify for assistance. In some states, people have the option to automatically qualify for LIHEAP benefits if they participate in other federal assistance programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). </span>
<h3><b>$400 Each Month For Food Expenses</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Covering food expenses is among the top priorities for families going through financial hardship. The federal government operates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps low income families cover basic expenses.</span>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More than 44 million Americans currently receive at least $100 a month from SNAP. Families with children usually receive about $400 a month. However, the amount of money received through SNAP will depend on several factors, such as income and household size. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To qualify for SNAP, the annual gross income of a family must no more than 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, which equaled $27,640 for a three-member family in 2019. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Families that include a senior member or a person with a disability are excluded from this requirement. Money received from other assistance programs such as unemployment benefits or Medicare does not count toward the income requirement. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In addition to income requirements, qualifying families must not have more than $2,250 in assets. This number is raised to $3,500 if the family includes an elderly or disabled person. However, it does not include the value of their home, one vehicle, and other assets that the federal government has exempted, such as household goods and personal effects. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low-income families who meet the required criteria can submit an application to the local SNAP office. The application can be submitted online, by mail, or in person. When submitting an application, households must provide documents that certify their eligibility to the program, such as proof of income or employment.</span>
<h3><b>$450 From Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Families and individuals who need further financial support can receive help through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). This program is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and provides cash assistance to families who fall into financial hardship. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This benefit is only available to families with children, and in cases where both the parents and other close relatives are unable to cover the family’s basic needs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Families can receive benefits for no more than two consecutive years and no more than five years during their lifetimes. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Recipients must find work within two years of first receiving aid. They must also participate in work activities for a minimum number of hours to remain eligible for the program. Two-parent families must work 35 to 55 hours per week, while single parents need to complete 30 work hours to stay in the program.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Money received through welfare can be used to cover basic expenses, such as buying food, household supplies, or bills. On average, a family of three (two parents and one child) receives $450 through the program. However, some low-income states provide as little as $300. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To receive those benefits, families must also meet some additional requirements. For example, all family members must be U.S. citizens and their children must be younger than 18 years old. Any children between ages 6 and 17 who have not graduated from high school must attend school. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are some income-related requirements too. A family of three, for example, must not have a monthly gross income above $750 nor countable assets above $1,000.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Each state is given broad authority to expand or reduce TANF requirements so they can adapt to the local population.</span>","If you need some extra money, the government currently allows up to $1,750 each month for assistance.

The money to pay for this research is coming from a group of popular consumer brands. Below we provide a list of 10 surveys that you could take for cash right now.

Making money from home has been gaining popularity among working adults whose main job might not provide enough income. Today, there is a range of jobs creating lots of flexibility to work from home. Completing online surveys is one source of income hiring right now and these jobs don’t require having completed a college degree.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

It’s a good deal for companies too, online surveys are tools used by companies to understand the appeal of their products and services. People can take advantage of their spending routines to make some money by giving their opinion on the products they buy or the services they use.

In this article, we provide basic information about online surveys, things to consider when filling them, and a list of sites actively hiring for survey responders.
<h3>What are online surveys?</h3>
Online surveys are digital questionnaires promoted by companies. Their purpose is to gather valuable information from people in order to improve their product, service or brand.

Participants are paid in return for such information. Some companies pay participants in cash, while others prefer to offer cash equivalent rewards such as coupons and gift cards.

Most online surveys can be completed in twenty minutes. In general, participants must answer questions related to if and how they use one or more specific products. However, not everyone can participate in an online survey.

Companies create criteria that potential participants must match before they are allowed to participate in any given survey. Some companies establish these criteria by asking participants to create an account and provide basic information about them.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>What is required to complete online surveys</h3>
Anyone who wants to complete online surveys must prepare before they start. First, they should make a list of brands whose services or products they purchase to measure how many online surveys they could realistically complete. However, most homeowners qualify for surveys that seek information about things almost everyone pays for, such as utility bills or groceries.

Second, people should be aware that most online survey platforms pay through PayPal. As a result, participants will have to create a Paypal account and link it to their bank accounts.

Setting up a Paypal account is not complicated. To start receiving money, participants only need a valid email account and identification number. However, anyone who prefers to cash out their rewards in gift cards can skip this step.

Third, some survey sites award points after each survey is complete. Rewards can be claimed once a certain number of points have been earned. In other cases, participants are given a flat amount of money per survey. However, sites who award money right away may impose minimum withdrawal limits, which can be between $50 and $100.

Finally, participants should be willing to provide personal information. Online surveys often ask questions that some people might be uncomfortable answering.

It is recommended to read the fine print before signing up and understanding the nature of each survey before agreeing to participate in them. Most websites allow participants to abandon the survey if they do not agree with any of the questions.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Things to consider when doing online surveys</h3>
Regardless of which site they choose, participants must always read the fine print and be fully aware of all the terms and conditions. Despite their simplicity, online surveys can take a significant amount of time when added up. As a result, it is important to focus on a single survey website until enough points have been earned and a reward can be claimed.

Jumping between survey sites is not recommended. Participants who do so often end up spreading their points across multiple platforms, claiming fewer rewards and thus making less money. However, it is encouraged to test different alternatives after claiming a reward if the chosen survey site fails to meet expectations.

<h3>Best online survey sites</h3>
Online surveys are one way struggling families can gain some extra money to cover monthly expenses. Although $2 for a single survey may seem like a drop in a bucket, after a month of casual work, diligent people can add $200 to their pocket. In this section, we offer a list of ten online survey sites that offer reliable rewards.
<h4>1. PaidViewPoint</h4>
PaidViewPoint is one of the best survey sites on the Internet. It has a long list of comprehensive surveys which take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete. Participants can withdraw their earnings starting from $15, either as cash to a Paypal account or as an Amazon or Walmart gift card.

PaidViewPoint has become one of the best places for people looking to make extra money with online surveys. This is because of its simple interface and easy registration process.

<h4>2. VIP Voice</h4>
VIP Voice is an online research community that belongs to the NPD Group. With more than 3 million users, VIP Voice is one of the largest survey sites on the Internet.

Homeowners and renters who decide to join this community will get about 3 to 5 surveys each week, with the potential to make around $30 each month with little effort. VIP Voice does not give direct cash rewards. Instead, members receive points which can be used to enter sweepstakes and auctions.

Winning a sweepstake may award cash, vacations and more. Auctions allow members to bid on products and services. Students may find VIP Voice an attractive proposition due to the $5,000 scholarship opportunity it provides to its members.
<h4>3. Swagbucks</h4>
Swagbucks is a well-known online money making website, offering many alternatives to make quick cash beyond surveys. However, online surveys are one of its most popular features. Swagbucks is very newcomer-friendly, awarding free points to its members.

It also awards $5 to new members who complete one survey right after they sign up. Users of this website can withdraw their earnings to a Paypal account or through gift cards from known retailers like Amazon.

<h4>4. Toluna</h4>
Toluna is another popular survey panel used by a large number of marketing companies around the world. Although it offers other products and services, the survey panel remains its most popular membership program.

Each completed survey grants a number of points which can be exchanged for a voucher after enough points have been earned. Most surveys take 15 minutes to complete. In general, it takes about 4 hours to gather 80,000 points and turn them into a $15 voucher.
<h4>5. MyPoints</h4>
MyPoints was established in 1996 as a rewards program website. Registered members can collect points by completing purchases from selected retailers. To collect points faster, members can complete daily online surveys. Unlike other survey panels, MyPoints rewards its members even if they are disqualified from a survey.

Online surveys are not the only way to collect points on this website. Inviting friends, playing select games and printing coupons also give a considerable amount of points. Money earned can be exchanged for gift cards or sent to a PayPal account.

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-2608"" src=""https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey3.png"" alt="""" width=""650"" height=""351"" />

<h4>6. Opinion Outpost</h4>
Opinion Outpost is an online market research pioneer. This decade-old free community offers rewards for sharing opinions on certain products and services.

The website is one of the most reliable in terms of fast payments, as it often takes less than several hours to deposit earnings. Those who decide to join can claim rewards as cash to a PayPal account or as iTunes and Amazon gift cards.
<h4>7. One Opinion</h4>
One Opinion is similar to other free online communities mentioned above. Members are asked to share their opinions on selected products and services in return for points which can be traded for cash through PayPal or Visa prepaid cards.

People can make hundreds of points per day by completing surveys, including those in which they were disqualified. The minimum amount that can be redeemed is 25,000 points which is equal to $25.
<h4>8. Survey Junkie</h4>
Survey Junkie is a popular alternative for people who already tested other paid survey websites. The company does not have a mobile app, which means that most of its surveys are meant to be completed on a computer.

However, its constant stream of quality surveys and flexible payment methods make up for the lack of mobile options. Also, earnings are available for withdrawal as soon as $10 or 1,000 points are reached, a lower amount than most other survey sites.

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-2609"" src=""https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey4.png"" alt="""" width=""650"" height=""3153"" />

<h4>9. PointClub</h4>
PointClub offers much more variety than its competitors. Like many other popular survey sites, PointClub rewards points even if the member gets disqualified. However, it stands out due to its extensive reward options, which include Visa prepaid cards, Walmart and Amazon gift cards, and movie vouchers.

The downside of PointClub is its high requirements for withdrawal. The only options are 25,000 points for a $25 gift card or 50,000 points for $50 sent to a Paypal account.
<h4>10. Harris Poll</h4>
Harris Poll is not as popular as other alternatives, mostly due to its focus on packaged food products. However, the companies looking to perform market research through this website tend to offer much higher pay than other online survey platforms.

For example, a standard survey on Harris Poll pays between $3 and $4 and can be completed in less than 20 minutes. There are more comprehensive surveys called local panels that can take two to four hours to complete but pay as much as $75. Harris Poll is a potential gold mine for food enthusiasts.","We have this great opportunity for anyone who can speak about being a single parent in America.","2021-06-27 04:35:24",post,https://spaoa.org/100-for-your-thoughts-a-list-of-online-surveys-that-pay-single-parents/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyparents.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/link1.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey3.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey4.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey5.png,surveyparents.png|link1.png|survey3.png|survey4.png|survey5.png,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyparents.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/link1.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey3.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey4.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/survey5.png,2547|2544|2545|2546|2548,surveyparents|link1|survey3|survey4|survey5,||||,||||,||||,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/surveyparents.png,"Work From Home","Rental Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,100-for-your-thoughts-a-list-of-online-surveys-that-pay-single-parents,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-09 13:45:55"
2549,"How to Cancel Debt: For Single Parents","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

It is absolutely lonely being over your head in debt. You owe that money and nobody is going to pay it for you. Even after making monthly payments faithfully, most of it is going toward interest while that principal is going nowhere! It’s a terrible drag, but you’re not alone.

The cost of living has risen by about 30 percent in the last 10 years, forcing most people to borrow just to live. But there are some shortcuts to pay off debt.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

This list of suggestions can help people greatly reduce the amount of money they owe. These easy-to-follow practices are designed to reduce spending, avoid common mistakes, and efficiently tackle debt. Along the way, we suggest some sponsored services that specialize in negotiating down debt.
<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
To get out of debt, people must first know how much money they owe. A surprising amount of people ignore how large their debt actually is, and believe that faithfully paying their bills is enough to eventually get rid of it. Many also think that they will never get out of debt. According to a 2015 annual debt survey by CreditCards.com,  almost 20 percent of debtors believe they will be in debt forever.

Contrary to what they believe, eliminating debt is possible. However, doing so requires discipline and determination. Financial institutions are willing to provide detailed information about current debt, and from there, debtors can start paying it off. As high as it may be, debt can only go down if people follow the suggestions in this guide.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Control Your Spending</h3>
Controlling debt-financed spending is the first thing debtors should do. If expenditures remain higher than monthly payments, debt will continue to grow. A general rule to follow is “if you don’t really need it, don’t buy it.” Unnecessary spending is one of the main causes of excessive credit card debt in the United States.

Some families have a hard time cutting spending due to lack of organization with their finances. To fix this problem, households can track their expenses for one month and determine which items should go away. Reducing unnecessary spending is important because it gives people access to additional money that could be put toward paying off their debt.
<h3>Create a Budget</h3>
Spending control goes hand in hand with a responsible budget. Families should always have a list of mandatory expenses, including food and utility bills, to understand how much money they have to spend on a monthly basis.

A budget will help them identify which expenses are unnecessary as well as the difference between their earnings and expenditures, which is called a deficit. The main purpose of a budget is to quantify the deficit and cut the items that cause it.

Subscriptions and other recurrent expenses may seem insignificant at first. However, when added up, they can represent a large part of a family’s expenses. For example, a $65 monthly Cable TV subscription may not look like a sizable expenditure, yet it becomes a significant money sink when compared with Netflix’s comparable $8 monthly service. A family could save up to $50 if they are eligible to get free phone service from the government through the Lifeline program.

This is only one example of how creating a budget can help families single out expenditures that could be replaced with cheaper options or removed altogether. It also helps them determine if they need financial assistance. A family with elevated food spending may want to request assistance from the government.

Almost all states have home energy programs that subsidize heating and cooling for families within the required income levels. Contacting local agencies to find out which programs can help reduce spending is a good next step after creating a budget.

<h3>Organize Your Debt</h3>
Organizing all outstanding debt is the next step after creating a budget and cutting unnecessary spending. To do this, you must have all the relevant information, including amounts, interest rates, minimum payments, and more. Remember that most financial institutions will provide this information if requested.

There are two methods to organize debt. The first is to list all debts from smallest to largest, regardless of interest rates. People can build momentum with this method because smaller debt is paid off quickly, consolidating efforts on larger debt like student loans. The downside of this path is inefficient exploitation of low interest rates, which saves the most money over time.

The second method accounts for interest rates. It’s called “laddering” and it works by listing all debts, beginning with those with highest interest rates. By eliminating high interest debt first, laddering saves the most money in the long term.

Debt with high interest rates generates larger monthly payments. Working to reduce it first will help you ease the burden on paychecks and improve your credit score at the same time.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Paying Off Your Debt</h3>
Whichever method you choose, the trick is to stick to it. Switching plans along the way will negatively affect on your finances. If needed, a family could design a hybrid plan that pays off small debt right away.

Subsequently, they can switch to a laddered approach to tackle high interest rates. Excess cash generated from spending control and budget analysis can be used to speed up the process of paying off debt.

When you’re ready to start paying off your debt, make sure you keep the following suggestions in mind. First, always try to pay more than the minimum payment established by the financial institution. Contrary to popular belief, minimum payments do not contribute toward reducing outstanding debt.

In many cases, they end up enlarging it instead. Banks and other financial institutions set minimum payments low enough to make sure debt either grows or remains intact over time.

The second recommendation is to invest as much money as possible toward paying off debt. Excess money no longer spent on unnecessary stuff should be used to tackle debt. Remember that the more money being put in today, the less interest being paid tomorrow.

Try to avoid common mistakes like closing accounts once the balance has been paid. Although reducing the number of open accounts seems like a good idea, in reality it tends to have the opposite effect.

In our guide about how to improve credit scores, we talk about the credit utilization ratio, which is obtained by dividing a household’s credit card balance by their total available credit. Paying off debt reduces credit card balance. Closing an account reduces your total available credit.

It’s no secret that despite the promising economy, many Americans find themselves with more debt each year. The average household in the United States owes at least $130,000. This often includes mortgages, student or auto loans, and credit card debt. That number can be daunting, but with discipline and determination, it could go down significantly in a few years.","If you have a mountain of debt and need a way to get rid of it, keep reading this article.

2554,"Recruiting All Single Parents for Continuing Education Grants","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For many single parents, getting a college degree could become their ticket out of financial hardship. It allows them to access higher-paying jobs and opportunities that were not available before. However, the increasing costs of higher education have represented a problem for many Americans. </span>

[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this article, we explore the different methods that low-income families and individuals can take advantage of to obtain the degree they desire. We provide information about grants, scholarships and other resources that is easy to understand and that can prove consequential in the road out of financial hardship.</span>

<h3><strong>Education Grants</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Educational grants are usually given by academic institutions and non-profit organizations to individuals with high qualifications that require financial assistance to continue their studies. Along with scholarships, educational grants are one of the most popular resources that many pre-graduate students rely on to go through college.</span>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Educational grants don’t have to be repaid, but most institutions have a long list of requirements that applicants must meet before they are awarded the money they need to cover their college and living expenses. For example, they must have high grades and a clean record, and some organizations also request recommendations from academic institutions.</span>

<h3><strong>Pell Grants</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Pell Grant is a subsidy provided by the United States government to students who are in financial need and cannot afford to pay for college. It was created in 1965 and since then has become one of the most popular educational grants in the world, helping more than 5.5 million college and vocational school students across the country.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pell Grants are considered as the bedrock above which a student’s financial aid is established. Most Pell recipients enjoy the benefits of other forms of aid that are attached to their grant as a single customized package that is adjusted to their needs. This money is then awarded to each recipient on a yearly basis so that they can pay for any expenses.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Department of Education maintains a standard formula that it uses to determine which students qualify to receive a Pell grant. The formula produces a number called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) which determines eligibility. In addition to that, applicants must also be undergraduate students who have yet to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Both U.S. citizens and permanent residents can apply.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To receive the Pell grant, families must submit an application using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, commonly known as FAFSA. The form has to be submitted before the student starts their freshman undergraduate year and then each year as they progress through college. Each year, the government will review their application and determine how much money will be granted as a result. As of 2017, eligible students are given no more than $5,900 each year to cover their expenses. </span>
<h3><strong>FSEOG Grants</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is another alternative that students can explore if they find themselves in a position where they cannot afford to pay for college. Similar to Pell Grants, FSEOG Grants are awarded to college undergraduate students and do not have to be repaid. A recipient of this grant receives between $100 and $4,000 each year to help them cover their college-related expenses.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To be eligible for a FSEOG grant, a student must meet certain requirements. First, their family must fill the FAFSA form to allow the government to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). This will determine if the student is in financial need, as well as how much money will be awarded by the grant. Second, the student must be a U.S. citizen. Permanent residents of the United States are not eligible for a FSEOG grant.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FSEOG Grants can also be awarded directly to schools, which then choose which students are in financial need and how much money they require to successfully complete their school year. In this case, the federal government covers up to 75% of the grant, while the school is responsible for the remaining 25%. The amount of FSEOG money given to a school varies each year, depending on a variety of factors.</span>
<h3><strong>Scholarships</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scholarships are one of the most popular options for students all around the world. Many organizations and educational institutions award thousands of scholarships every year as students look for ways to reduce the costs to obtain their degrees. Like grants, scholarships award students with money to cover college expenses. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some educational institutions make it so that scholarship recipients don’t have to pay to enroll and attend their schools. This is an invaluable resource for qualified students, paving the way for them to become successful professionals, and most importantly, achieve it debt-free.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unlike grants, however, scholarships are given based on high grades or previous academic achievements. Some institutions also award scholarships based on individual talent. A big chunk of them are also handed out to individuals who focus on specific areas that the awarding institution is interested in pursuing, such as scientific research. </span>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3><strong>Student Loans</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Student loans are a last-resort option for many individuals that desire to obtain a college degree but for a variety of reasons are unable to qualify for either a grant or a scholarship. Most of these loans come from banks, and can become a significant economic burden for students as they go through college due to lack of significant income or rising interest rates.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To alleviate this concern, the federal government offers students the option to apply for a stafford loan. These special government-sponsored loans are made available to students that enroll in accredited institutions across the country and offer significantly lower interest rates. They are divided into subsidized and unsubsidized versions, with the former being approved only to students with financial need as demonstrated through their FAFSA application and Expected Family Contribution.</span>",,"2021-07-20 16:06:33",post,https://spaoa.org/recruiting-all-single-parents-for-continuing-education-grants/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SingleParents_01.jpg,SingleParents_01.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SingleParents_01.jpg,2555,SingleParents_01,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SingleParents_01.jpg,"Work From Home",Education,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,recruiting-all-single-parents-for-continuing-education-grants,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-22 13:25:27"
2559,"Single Parents, You Don’t Have To Pay ATM Fees","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low interest rates and expensive fees are two things most customers hate from traditional checking accounts. Today, there are many online-only accounts that come with no fees. Interest rates for these accounts can be as much as 25 times higher than traditional savings accounts, which can help families keep the money their bank would otherwise take.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your bank has locations all over town, take a guess how they pay for those locations. It’s by charging customers bank fees. Being completely transparent, there will be some inconvenience because online banks do not rely on storefront and bank tellers to do transactions. But they pass all those savings to you. Here is how it works:</span>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h2><b>Features of new checking accounts</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Checking accounts today can offer unique perks to its customers. One  important perk online banks sometimes offer is free access to ATMs.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may know that withdrawing money from online accounts often comes with a fee. This is because the online bank must pay brick and mortar institutions in order to access their ATM network.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The more aggressive accounts might also offer rewards for purchases made with a debit card. Rewards can save consumers up to $100 a year. This benefit is often not available in traditional brick and mortar institutions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Checking accounts often offer more than just transactional services. You can invest with them as well. The minimum investment can be as low as $10. </span><a href=""http://c.benefits-spaoa.com/click.aspx?cid=55572&amp;provider_id=[pid]&amp;cqs=idx&amp;md5=[md5]"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can search today’s rates of return for savings and retirement accounts here. </span></a>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h2><b>What about interest rates?</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Online checking accounts often come with high interest rates. In some cases, customers can get as much as 25 times more money from interest than they would with a traditional bank account. Some brick and mortar institutions do offer comparable rates, but they are only available to certain customers with high balances.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, Wells Fargo offers a premium savings account that comes with 2.15 percent annual interest rate for the first twelve months. However, customers must maintain a balance of at least $25,000 to qualify for the promotional rate. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maurie Backman from </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Motley Fool</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> reports that over 40 percent of households do not have $400 in cash at hand. Also, according to a report by the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, the median savings account balance is $8,100. This means most families do not have enough cash to enjoy these promotional rates.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In contrast, online checking accounts offer high interest rates regardless of balance. For example, Simple’s Checking and Budgeting account offers an annual interest of 2.02 percent regardless of how much money is placed in the account.</span>

<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h2><b>How to switch</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to a 2017 Bank Finder Report, the average account holder pays $330 each year in fees. By </span><a href=""http://c.benefits-spaoa.com/click.aspx?cid=55572&amp;provider_id=[pid]&amp;cqs=idx&amp;md5=[md5]"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">searching for active promotions</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, you can pay between $0 and $120 in fees, depending on what’s available at the moment. Checking regularly for three months will almost surely reveal the range of all promotions for a given area.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re ready to switch, you can get started with just an email account to search offers. Then, each bank will ask for other details, such as social security number. Many are restricted to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To protect customers from identity theft, banks also have a second step that involves several questions designed to determine whether the person creating the account is who they say they are. If the system is unable to verify the identity, an additional step must be completed.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At most, applicants will need a picture of both a primary and secondary government identification document, such as a driver's license and bank statement. Once these documents are submitted, the bank will take up to three days to verify the information and activate the account.</span>","If you’re a single parent with access to the Internet, you can switch today to an online checking account that pays you more in interest.

2567,"How to Survive on One Income as a Newly Single Parent","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Whether the change comes from a separation, divorce, or some other reason, several steps can make the transition easier to manage. This article will explore those steps.
<h3>Do Not Panic</h3>
While losing a partner can be emotionally draining, losing an income can be financially traumatic. As hard as it may be, it’s vital not to panic. Instead, get a clear picture of the financial situation to see what needs to be done.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Is there any money set aside for emergencies? Count it, as this change in income could easily be considered as such. Will there be any money coming in as a result of the loss? Infusions of cash via alimony, child support, or life insurance payouts should be documented, as well as any others that could help pay the bills.

<h3>Get Help from Others</h3>
Asking for help from family, friends, coworkers, etc. can provide essential relief when times get tough. If that sounds too uncomfortable to do, ask for assistance by giving something in exchange. Doing work around the house or babysitting are examples.

Reaching out to a personal network could result in a loan or income in exchange for services, but it could also create new job opportunities. For this reason alone, it’s an action worth taking.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Beyond personal contacts, a newly single parent can contact creditors, service providers, and the like to explain their situation. Hardship programs exist to provide financial relief, at least temporarily. Monthly payments can be reduced, due dates can be extended, and more to ease the burden that comes with adjusting to a single income.

If the single parent lacks a personal network to lean on, they can look elsewhere for help.

<h3>Find New Income Opportunities</h3>
As one provider leaves and takes their income with them, finding new ways to bring in money becomes crucial. The most common way to do so is by working extra hours or getting a second job. But since the single parent may need to take care of children, that may not be a viable option considering high childcare costs.

Luckily, there are several ways to gain extra income by working from home. Freelancing as a writer, virtual assistant, or some other service online is a great way to add a new flow of cash to the household.

There are other ways to bring in extra income besides employment. A garage sale or selling household items like clothes online can bring in cash fast. If there’s a spare car that isn’t being used, it can be sold. Likewise, an extra room in the home that’s not being used can be rented out for the time being.

One overlooked method of adding income is by readjusting current employment. As mentioned, working more hours can increase income, but so can asking for a raise. Lastly, tax withholdings can be adjusted to increase take-home pay. In exchange, the yearly tax refund will be lower, but this solves the issue of bringing in cash quickly to remedy the situation.

<h3>Make Budget Adjustments</h3>
If a budget was absent when two incomes were present, it will become necessary once one of them disappears. Creating a budget can make it easy to pinpoint unnecessary expenses. If something isn’t a necessity, it should be cut from the budget so that any essentials can be met.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

What are some examples of unnecessary expenses? Cable TV is one. Although the single parent may want cable for their children, they could change their plan to one with fewer channels and a lower monthly rate. Gym memberships could be cut as well, opting for in-home exercise that’s free as an alternative.

Necessary expenses could need adjusting too. Utility costs may be high and call for some changes regarding air conditioning, excessive water use, and the like. Cell phone service could be changed to a more affordable plan. Even car insurance changes could yield some much-needed savings. Credit cards are another place to look for instant savings. A quick call to the credit card company could result in a lower interest rate to free up some of the budget.","Transitioning from a two-income household to one as a single parent can be daunting.","2019-08-26 22:14:26",post,https://spaoa.org/how-to-survive-on-one-income-as-a-newly-single-parent/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_157340789.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HLP-Square-3.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HPL5.png|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rjgfhaklga.png,shutterstock_157340789.jpg|HLP-Square-3.png|HPL5.png|rjgfhaklga.png,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_157340789.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HLP-Square-3.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HPL5.png|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/rjgfhaklga.png,2568|2569|2570|2571,"shutterstock_157340789|HLP Square (3)|HPL5|rjgfhaklga",|||,|||,|||,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_157340789.jpg,"Work From Home",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,how-to-survive-on-one-income-as-a-newly-single-parent,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:54:16"
2572,"Try Before You Buy: How Rent-To-Own Home Programs Benefit Single Parents","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Maybe putting 20 percent as a down payment or low credit scores prevent you from loan qualification. Whichever the case, a rent-to-own program might allow you to secure the home of your dreams. We’ll explain how in this article.

<h3>What Is a Rent-To-Own Home?</h3>
Homes that are difficult to sell are sometimes listed as “rent to own.” Instead of buying the house then and there, an interested buyer has the option to lease now and purchase it later on.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

In a rent-to-own situation, the seller agrees to sell the home at a specific price in one to three years, without putting it on the market. During this time, the prospective buyer will lease the house for an agreed-upon amount.

<h3>How Do Rent-To-Own Programs Work?</h3>
Typically, when a home is listed as rent-to-own, the seller will require an option fee at the beginning of the lease period. It is similar to a deposit. A standard option fee is around five percent of the purchase price of the home.

Should the interested buyer decide they do not want to purchase the home, the option fee is typically non-refundable. Some sellers will allow the option fee to go towards the purchase price or down payment of the house after the lease period is over.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

During the lease period, monthly “rent” will be paid to the seller. The seller will not put the house on the market unless the buyer decides they do not want to purchase it.

The buyer may negotiate a rental credit, which puts a portion of the monthly rent paid towards the eventual purchase of the home. There is usually an option to buy before the end of the lease period as well.

The home must be sold at the price contracted at the beginning of the lease. This is one of the main benefits of rent-to-own. You can secure a house now, and the price will not go up even if the market does.

<h3>How Much Does Rent-To-Own Cost?</h3>
As mentioned, the option fee is typically five percent of the home price, which can be negotiated with some sellers. If the home’s purchase price is $100,000, $5,000 will need to be put down as the deposit, which may serve as part of the down payment when the home is purchased.

If the monthly rent would typically be $1,000 per month, the seller may increase it to $1,200. The extra $200 per month could be used as a credit for purchasing the home. At the end of the three years, $7,200 will have already been paid towards the down payment or purchase.
<h3>What If You Don’t Have Good Credit?</h3>
One of the main benefits of a rent to own program is the ability to build credit over the lease agreement so that you can qualify for the mortgage. Before entering a rent to own program, talk with a loan officer to see what you can realistically be eligible for in your timeline.

Sellers are more concerned with whether or not you can make the monthly payments. Since they are profiting monthly, can sell the house later on, and can keep your option fee, they are less affected if you decide you can’t afford the home.","Let’s say you’re shopping for homes and find the perfect home, but the price is a little out of reach.","2019-09-10 14:31:46",post,https://spaoa.org/try-before-you-buy-how-rent-to-own-home-programs-benefit-single-parents/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_747061408-e1586195179847.jpg,shutterstock_747061408-e1586195179847.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_747061408-e1586195179847.jpg,2573,shutterstock_747061408,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_747061408-e1586195179847.jpg,Housing,,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,try-before-you-buy-how-rent-to-own-home-programs-benefit-single-parents,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:54:14"
2574,"Mistakes That Make Car Insurance More Costly","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re making any of these mistakes that seem like sound moves, you could be. Learn how to avoid them so you can keep your monthly costs low.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know that getting into a car crash can increase your insurance premium. Adding a new teenage driver to your policy can do the same. But what about more unknown factors that can cause your car insurance rate to spike? Here are some that may surprise you, especially if you thought they’d work in your favor.</span>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Staying Loyal to One Company via Automatic Renewals</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Loyalty is usually regarded as a desirable trait. In the car insurance world, however, it can cost you. How much? According to J.D. Power, sticking with your current auto insurance provider for multiple years can result in you overpaying $300 per policy period.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why is loyalty penalized with car insurance? You could blame it on price optimization that leads to rate increases. Existing policies can be subject to yearly premium hikes too. Combine those, and you can see how loyalty equals forking over extra cash.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course, you may not want to switch providers, even if it cuts costs. You may enjoy the level of service and peace of mind they provide. If this is the case, you could get a price cut by getting lower quotes from their competition. With those quotes in place, you have the leverage to get your current rate lowered. Their incentive to appease you will come from the fact that they probably want to keep you as a customer.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When renewal time approaches, shop around. You may decide to switch to a new company to save money. Or you may choose to use your options to make your current company’s offer more affordable. Either way, you’re likely to save as long as you don’t let your policy renew automatically without seeing what’s out there.</span><b></b>

<h3><b>Having a History of State-Minimum Coverage</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Until you need it after an accident or some other unfortunate incident, car insurance seems like an unnecessary cost. It is essential due to laws and protection of your property, though, which is why you do everything you can to reduce it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One common mistake when it comes to reducing car insurance is keeping it at state-minimum levels. While this could cut costs in the short-term, the long-term expense of car insurance could rise. Why? In short, companies may see you as a higher risk than someone who maintained higher coverage levels.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Higher long-term costs aren’t the only reason to avoid minimum state coverage. Another is to protect yourself in the event of an accident.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, let’s say you carry state-minimum coverage in California. You total another driver’s brand new vehicle that has a starting MSRP of $40,000. While your minimum coverage has $5,000 of property damage liability, you could be on the hook for the other $35,000. For that reason alone, avoiding minimum coverage is a solid practice you may want to employ.</span>

2577,"Having Trouble Saving? Try These 4 Tips","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s face it: Saving is hard. Not only does it take a ton of effort, but it can also seem nearly impossible if your bills are piling up. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luckily, you don’t need a massive income to save. You just need to follow the tips in this article to set a solid foundation that will make saving seem like second nature.</span>
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Think of saving as a monthly bill</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can frame saving in a certain way to ensure you do it every single month. How? By turning it into a bill. Who are you paying? That person you see in the mirror every morning, a.k.a. yourself.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably pay your cell phone bill every month. The same likely holds true for your rent, mortgage, or car payment as well. If you slap the “bill” moniker on savings, you can start to set aside a significant amount each month.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps the best way to do this is to make it automatic. Some bank accounts allow you to create automatic monthly transfers from your checking account to a savings account. If you choose this route, make sure you have enough money to pay your regular bills too.</span>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3><b>Save a certain amount of your tips</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you get paid in tips? Such an income can make it super-difficult to save money since you’re dealing mostly with cash.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Still, you can start to save by dedicating a specific percentage of your tips to a savings account. For some, 10 percent is a decent number to begin with. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try it for a month, and you’ll be surprised at just how easy it is to keep cash on hand for your rainy day fund.</span>
<h3><b>Treat any extra cash as savings</b></h3>
<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re like most, you use second incomes or side gigs to bolster your bank account. Provided your primary income is enough to pay your bills, use this second income solely for saving.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For instance, you may mow lawns on weekends for extra money. Or you may do hair on the side. Either income should be kept as savings, if possible. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By saving and not splurging on impulse purchases, you’ll come to realize something: Peace of mind is worth more than material things.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cash from birthdays, holidays, or other gifts should be saved as well. In short, keep any extras. By making it into a habit, you’ll instill solid financial discipline along the way.</span>
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Put your savings in a hard-to-reach spot</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The whole purpose of savings is to leave it untouched. You want to have it on hand should an emergency arise, or to invest in something to secure your financial future. To achieve this goal, you should keep your savings separate from your regular checking account.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An online bank account can help keep your savings untouched. If you can’t make ATM withdrawals nearby, you’ll be more likely to let your savings sit for its intended purpose.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even better, get a high-yield savings account. It will keep your money safe while it earns extra interest.</span>","Saving money for emergencies, your kids’ college funds, or any other purpose takes discipline.

2579,"7 Tips to Increase Your Credit Score","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3><strong>Control spending via alerts</strong></h3>
You can put a stop to unnecessary spending by setting up email alerts. For instance, if you spend 30 percent of a credit card’s limit, an alert could tell you it’s time to stop. You can then start paying down that balance and use another card.
<h3><strong>Add another credit card</strong></h3>
Your credit utilization ratio makes up a significant portion of your credit score (30 percent, to be exact). You want to keep it below 30 percent, which can be accomplished by paying down your cards. You can also, however, get new cards to reduce your ratio and increase your available credit.

While adding cards can keep your credit utilization ratio low, don’t apply for them all at once. Getting too many new credit cards in a short period could be a red flag. Since it may indicate financial problems, certain credit score compilers may knock you for it.
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><strong>Keep your credit cards open</strong></h3>
Another way to keep your available credit high and your utilization ratio low is to keep your cards open. Sure, some may have high annual fees, but unless they’re incredibly high, you may be better served saving the card.

If you’re worried about your spending habits spiraling out of control, cut up the cards, but keep the numbers handy. You could use them for occasional online purchases to avoid closure due to inactivity.

<h3><strong>Keep your credit cards active</strong></h3>
Having a card canceled due to inactivity can negatively impact you in two ways. First, it lowers how much available credit you have, which tampers with your utilization ratio. Second, it can shorten your average credit history.

To stay on top of your cards to avoid unexpected cancellations, put each unused card in an envelope. Write the date you last used it on the outside. When one year since its last use approaches, take it out and make a purchase to keep it active. Pay off that balance, and you’ll be good to go.
[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h3><strong>Increase your credit limits</strong></h3>
You can increase your available credit by merely calling your card issuer and asking for a larger limit. Before doing so, ask your issuer if they will do a hard inquiry. If so, it could decrease your score by some points.

Should you still ask for the credit increase if it results in a hard inquiry? Yes, since a higher limit can decrease your credit utilization ratio, resulting in an even bigger jump to offset any loss.

To play it safe, ask the issuer if you’re likely to get an increase before making a formal request.
<h3><strong>Spend less</strong></h3>
Another way to keep that ever-important utilization ratio low is to use less credit. Set up a specific limit, say 25 percent of your credit. Once you pass it, move to cash for purchases.
<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h3><strong>Spend evenly</strong></h3>
Each credit card has its own utilization ratio. Use one card too frequently while ignoring others, and you could lower your credit score due to a lack of balance.

An easy way to keep your cards balanced is to employ a maximum usage limit for each. For instance, you could put the max at 20 percent per card. Once one card reaches that limit, put it away, and use the next.","Want to decrease your cost of borrowing? Then it’s time to increase your credit score.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you expected to pay a debt as the surviving spouse? That’s a question many newly single parents have when their partner passes. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To see what you could be responsible for, we’ll take a closer look at medical bills, mortgage debt, and credit card debt for widows.</span>
<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h3><b>How Community Property States Affect Debt</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you live in any of the following states, you may want to consult an attorney for detailed debt advice concerning your situation:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alaska</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Arizona</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">California</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Idaho</span></li>

 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wisconsin</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In these community property states, a husband and wife bear equal responsibility for debts acquired during the marriage. In other words, if your deceased spouse acquired debt while you two were married, you may have to pay it.</span>
<h3><b>Medical Debt</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you remember signing a document when your spouse was admitted to the hospital? If it said you would be responsible for payments on any bills related to that stay, you might have to pay.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As stated, living in a community property state could make you liable for your spouse’s medical bills as well.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A doctrine of necessities exists in some states. It makes the spouse responsible for certain expenses incurred by their partner during the marriage that are deemed as necessary. Medical bills often fall under this category.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you in the clear if you don’t live in a community property state or your state doesn’t have a doctrine of necessities? Not necessarily, since a creditor may still request payment from the deceased spouse’s estate.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since there is so much gray area associated with medical bills and they can be extremely costly, it’s best to consult an attorney for expert advice.</span>
<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>Mortgage Debt</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An unpaid mortgage usually falls on the surviving spouse’s lap. If you want to keep the home so you can continue living in it, you’ll need to come up with timely payments. Doing so will avoid foreclosure and sale of the house via a sheriff’s auction.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You could use your spouse’s life insurance policy to satisfy the mortgage debt, or rely on a loan from someone else to stay afloat. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You could also sell the home as a last resort. In this scenario, you would need to find a new place to live, which could become costly due to moving expenses.</span>
[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h3><b>Credit Card Debt</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are listed as a co-signer on the credit card in question, you will be responsible for the debt, even if you have never personally used the card. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ignoring the debt will result in action from collection agencies, plus a negative hit to your credit score. To avoid these issues, you may want to speak to a nonprofit credit counseling agency for advice on managing the debt.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are listed as an authorized user on the account but are not a co-signer, you will not be responsible. Your deceased partner’s estate will be liable, however.

<!-- AdSense -->[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3><b>What Is a Hardship Letter?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the home loan arena, a hardship letter describes the financial setbacks a homeowner has experienced that makes them unable to pay their mortgage.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately, simply stating that you cannot pay your mortgage on time isn’t enough for most lenders. They want to know that the hardship you experienced is a legitimate one. They also want to know how that hardship specifically affected your ability to pay.</span>
<h3><b>Examples of Bona Fide Financial Hardships</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not all hardships are created equal in the eyes of a lender. Here are some examples of genuine hardships that could convince a lender to decide in your favor:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">       </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Adoption of a new child</span></li>

<h3><b>Questions Your Hardship Letter Must Address</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the hardship experienced is vital in your lender’s decision, so are other factors. When writing your letter, you want to provide every detail you can to explain your situation. The more details you include, the easier it is for the lender to understand why you cannot pay.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To give your hardship letter some structure, include answers to the following questions:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On what specific date (or range of dates) did the hardship occur?</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What event caused the hardship that made it impossible to meet your monthly mortgage payment?</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Is the hardship permanent or temporary? (Death, divorce, or separation could be considered permanent. Short-term illness, injury, or a job layoff could be considered temporary.)</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Can you afford to make a payment? If so, how much?</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you behind on your mortgage payments? If so, how far behind are you? (Include the months behind and a total dollar amount, if possible.)</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What are you doing to address the hardship to get back on your feet financially? (Trying to find a new job/second income, selling assets, or budgeting are examples.)</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do you want to keep your home? (If you do not, the lender may reject any request to modify your loan.)</span></li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s never too early to start planning for your child’s future. The earlier you do it, the easier it will be to achieve your goals. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s your likely overall goal? It may not be to make them a millionaire before they enter the workforce. Being able to give them a savings cushion, however, would be nice. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As long as they have some savings, they can hit college running or start their own business. Follow these tips from the start, and your children should have such options by the time they hit adulthood.</span>

<h3><b>Get Life Insurance Before They’re Born</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What would happen if you weren’t around to support your family? How would they survive on limited income? Such are thoughts that no one wants to ponder, but you should before your child is born.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How can you alleviate these concerns? By getting life insurance.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While planning for your child’s birth has enough expenses on its own, that’s no excuse to avoid life insurance. You don’t need to pay hundreds of dollars per month for a policy, as just $5 a month will get you started.</span>

<a href=""https://hellobestow.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bestow offers life insurance starting at $5 monthly.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> While that’s certainly affordable, the company also makes it super-simple to get started.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You don’t need to waste hours with insurance agents, nor do you need an extensive medical exam. Just answer a few questions, and Bestow will set you up with a policy that’s quick, affordable, and provides proper coverage should an unfortunate event occur.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Who does this work best for? People under 54 years old who probably don’t need a financial adviser to get this type of basic protection.</span>
[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h3><b>Start Saving Soon After They’re Born</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Putting a little cash into a savings account before your child hits five will result in a nice, saved sum down the line. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For example, just a $25 monthly contribution to a savings account when they are two years old will grow to around $5,000 once they are 18. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want those savings to grow even more? Put them into a high-yield savings account that will use compound interest to your advantage.</span>

<h3><b>Teach Your Child the Value of a Dollar</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Its never too early to get your kids acquainted with finance. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Give them an allowance in exchange for chores. Let them spend it on what they want, as long as they know they’ll need to work more to buy more. In doing so, they’ll learn the value of a dollar and appreciate what it takes to make purchases.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Taking your child grocery shopping is another way to teach them about money. Differentiate needs from wants, such as sweets versus meat. Once they see that money doesn’t grow on trees and that it must be allocated properly, they’ll respect it more. This respect can grow into an interest in what it takes to make money.</span>

<h3><b>Let Them Make Money-Related Decisions</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As your child grows, get them involved in financial decisions. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t buy them every new electronic device, even if you can afford it. Make them choose, using a budget as some sort of restriction.

2587,"Simple Ways to Save Money Online","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Even if you saved $5.00 a week, you would save $260 in a year, so start saving! You don’t have to sacrifice all of your indulgences; you have to go about things smarter. Here are some of the easiest Internet-based things you can do to cut costs now:
<h3>Use Online Coupons</h3>
Couponing online has become incredibly easy. Visit sites like RetailMeNot or CouponCodes, and you’ll find discounts on everyday products that can work for a wide variety of retailers, including Walmart, Target, Sears, and Macy’s.

When you check out, you’ll see the words “promo code.” Just copy and paste your code into the field, and that’s it. You’ll be astounded by the rewards you can reap.
[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
Meanwhile, Amazon has an entire section of its website dedicated to coupons. Here, you can find discounts in specific categories, such as groceries, electronics, and office supplies, and the coupons get even more enticing for Prime Members.

The Google Chrome web browser also has an extension, called Wikibuy that can yield savings. It will automatically test its coupon codes at checkout.
<h3>Shop Around and Compare</h3>
While online coupons are a great way to save money, merely shopping online is another. Compare online prices versus those in brick and mortar stores, and you’ll find that you can save plenty of cash by clicking to purchase instead of visiting the store.

Price comparison websites and apps will show you where you can snag the most savings within seconds. Shopular, ShopSavvy, Google Shopping are examples of cost-cutting apps and sites you can use for quick price comparisons.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Get Free Music (Or Even Rent It)</h3>
As a music fan, you don’t have to buy music at all. Long gone are the days of CDs, as people are hardly purchasing music thanks to subscription services like Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora.

If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you can download music off its platform for free. Yes, you can stream songs, but you can also choose from more than one million MP3s to keep on your phone or computer.

Even if you aren’t an Amazon Prime member, streaming services like Pandora offer a free version. If you add up those savings over one or two years, it makes their commercials much more tolerable.

<h3>Get Cash Back When You Buy</h3>
While online coupons are the most common way to save money when shopping on the Web, earning cash back is a less-known method.

Sites like BeFrugal and Rakuten allow you to shop among thousands of popular websites and stores like Amazon and Macy’s. Since they get a commission for sending customers, they offer cash back as an incentive for you to shop through them.

The more you shop, the more cash back you can get. And over time, you can accumulate a nice little sum that can be used to buy even more.

2589,"2 Medicare Part D Problems You Can Fix During Open Enrollment","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You have from now until December 7th to ensure your Medicare coverage is complete and cost-effective. If you take prescriptions, looking over your Part D plan is a good idea while you can. If you don’t, you may experience sticker shock once 2020 hits.

There are two problems in particular that you can fix right now to keep your drug costs down. Let’s jump into them now so you can correct them before open enrollment ends.
[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Overpaying by using the same Part D plan as your spouse</h3>
Do you take the same prescriptions as your spouse? Probably not, which is why picking the same Part D plan isn’t a solid strategy.

You’ll be hard-pressed to find family discounts for Part D plans. For this reason, it’s best to shop for prescription coverage separately from your spouse. If one of you takes more medication than the other and you’re on the same plan, you could be overpaying.

If this is your current case, shopping separately right now could see lower medical costs in 2020 that you can use to pay down debt or cover other expenses.

Have you been using the same Part D plan strictly out of convenience? Now’s the perfect time to change that, as you still have time to find more affordable, yet adequate coverage for the coming year.

Once you see the potential savings you can enjoy by shopping for Plan D separately, you may find that such convenience isn’t worth it.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Increasing Plan D premiums</h3>
Just as with other costs, Medicare Plan D premiums can increase each year. Sticking to your current plan without exploring new options could mean paying more for the same coverage you currently enjoy.

While paying more is an issue, so is getting less coverage for prescriptions you currently take. Since plan formularies that calculate what you pay for medications can change, you could find yourself poorly covered for your needs in 2020.

As with using the same plan as your spouse, convenience may come into play here. You may want to avoid having to research new Part D plans, which could lead you to make no changes.

What can happen as a result? Your plan D premiums can increase in 2020, and you may find yourself scrambling to pay for the prescriptions you need.

Luckily, seeing what’s out there in terms of Part D options is rather simple. Just use the Medicare Plan Finder, and you can shop for 2020 plans within seconds.
<!-- Media.net -->[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
By entering your location, the medications you need, and other info, you’ll be able to see if changing your Part D plan during open enrollment is worth it.

As a side note, the Plan Finder has been updated for 2020. If you used it last year, you might want to give yourself some time to get acquainted with it to ensure you find what you need.

In short, don’t wait until the last minute to shop around. You still have until December 7th to make changes that could net significant savings in the new year.

Last, but not least, take an inventory of the prescriptions you currently use. Are you taking fewer medications than before? A new part D plan could give you the necessary coverage at a lower cost.

2591,"These 8 Ideas Show That Dating Doesn’t Have To Cost A Dime","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What’s an excuse many people use for not dating? They say it’s too expensive. While that may be true if you feel like you need to wine and dine a person, dating does not have to cost a thing.

Here are several date ideas that will let you save as you get to know someone new:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Learn to dance.</h3>
Dancing is a great date idea since it gets you close to that special someone by default. Although some dance classes may come with a cost, look for local clubs that offer complimentary lessons to the public.
<h3>2. Observe art.</h3>
Living in a big city has its perks, especially when it comes to art. If your date has expressed an interest in this area, search for local art galleries with upcoming exhibits or openings. Many are free to attend.
<h3>3. Visit a brewery or winery.</h3>
Why pay for your drinks when you can get them for free? Your local brewery or winery may offer free samples as you get a greater appreciation of what it takes to make quality booze.

<h3>4. Enjoy the outdoors at a park.</h3>
There are plenty of date-related options at a park. You can go for a walk while you talk, or sit down and have a nice picnic lunch. If you both have pets, bring them along to make the date even better.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>5. Attend a free comedy show.</h3>
They say that getting your date to laugh will earn you major points. You don’t have to be funny yourself if you bring them to a comedy show, though.

Some comedy clubs offer free shows from time to time, so be on the lookout. You may not see Adam Sandler in person, but you could get to check out local talent before they make it big.
<h3>6. Show off your cooking skills at home.</h3>
Why pay a premium for food at a fancy restaurant, when you can do the cooking yourself? Everyone loves a great cook, so if you have this skill, use it to your advantage. You can cook together to bond and finish the date off with your favorite Netflix show on the couch.
<h3>7. Perform at open mic night.</h3>
Dates like this give you the opportunity to avoid awkward silence as you let others entertain you. If you have singing talent or poetry you’d like to share, you can show it off too to make a great first impression.

Regardless of if you’re a spectator or participator, open mic night is a great first date idea that won’t break the bank. Be sure to call beforehand to make sure there’s no cover charge.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>8. Work out together.</h3>
Are you both fitness enthusiasts? If so, the gym is tough to beat as a first date idea.

Many say working out together is ideal for a first date since it gets those endorphins going and helps you bond over a common interest. Once the workout is finished, feel free to use any other date idea in this list to ramp up that rapport.","Who says you need tons of disposable income to date?

2593,"Bad Credit? Try These Places For Personal Loans","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3>“Bad Credit” Definition</h3>
In terms of your FICO score, “bad credit” means anything 579 or below. Such a score limits your options compared to something higher that would put you in the “fair credit” bracket.

Finding funding is not impossible with bad credit, however, so let’s look at where you could score a personal loan when you’re in a pinch.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Your Local Bank or Credit Union</h3>
You may think that local banks or credit unions only offer loans to borrowers with solid credit. That’s not entirely true, though, as you will find some institutions that will make exceptions.

Why would a local lender be willing to work with you? So they can better serve the community. This is especially true with credit unions since they are not-for-profit institutions.

There’s another reason why going local may get you a loan: familiarity. If you have an account with a local bank, for example, that receives regular pay, they’ll see your transaction history. By recognizing that you have income, they may be more likely to grant you the loan over an online lender who doesn’t know who you are.

You also have the added advantage of an in-person meeting with local banks and credit unions. When speaking with a loan officer, you can explain your situation entirely. They can give you face-to-face tips on how to improve your loan application so it gets approved. You can also discover new lending options that you may not have known existed.

What’s the downside to <a href=""https://spaoa.org/improve-your-finances-with-a-credit-builder-loan/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting a personal loan locally</a>? In-person meetings take time, and the application process may be more tedious than with an online lender. Still, it’s an option worth looking at if you’re limited.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Online Lenders</h3>
<strong>OneMain Financial</strong>

OneMain Financial has been around for over 100 years, so they’re no fly-by-night operation. They have over 1,600 locations and offer personal and auto loans from $1,500 to $20,000 with fixed rates and no origination fees.

Regardless of how bad your credit is, there’s no minimum credit score required, which is a plus. While that can get you in the door, OneMain does have interest rates that can exceed 30 percent, so read the fine print before proceeding. If the loan isn’t a real emergency, paying such high interest may not be worth it.

You can receive same-day funding, but you may be required to visit the nearest OneMain office for verification before getting the loan approved.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<strong>LendingClub</strong>

You can get a loan up to $40,000 with Lending Club that carries fixed interest so you won’t get any surprises. Depending on your credit score, that interest rate could exceed 30 percent. Once again, you’ll need to read all the fine print before making a decision.

You can repay the loan in three or five years, which can keep those monthly payments low. There is an origination fee of one to six percent, however, which will cut into the actual amount of money you can work with.","Bad credit may limit your options for personal loans, but you can still get financing if you look hard enough.

2595,"3 Common Myths About Cleaning Up Your Credit","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

How can you clean up your credit report quickly? By doing the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Submitting disputes to credit bureaus</li>
 	<li>Contacting businesses that have reported you to credit bureaus</li>
 	<li>Making goodwill requests for deletion of paid-off accounts
Sending pay for delete offers to creditors</li>
 	<li>Any of those moves can clean up your credit report and increase your score. The moves we are about to discuss, however, are myths that will not clean your credit at all.</li>
</ul>
In other words, don’t make them thinking you’ll see a positive change in your history.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Myth 1 – “Close an account to keep it from being reported.”</h3>
Some say you should close an account with a past due balance if you’re worried about it being reported.

What will closing that account do? Make it unavailable for use. It will still be subject to delinquency reporting, however, until you get up-to-date with payments.
<h3>Myth 2 – “File bankruptcy to clean your credit history completely.”</h3>
Yes, filing bankruptcy can give you a sigh of relief by discharging various debts. But does this mean that you have a clean slate of credit to start from?

The answer to that is no since those discharged accounts will stay on your credit report.

Accounts that are included in bankruptcy are noted as such. They will not be removed from your credit report. Depending on the type of bankruptcy you file, they could stay on it for ten years.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Myth 3 – “Pay off a delinquent balance to make it disappear from your report.”</h3>
Paying a delinquent balance can put you in better standing with a creditor. Once you pay it, however, its status will change to “Ok” or “Current” if it’s not in collections or charged-off.

What happens to collection and charge-off accounts? They keep carrying that negative label even if you pay what’s due.

<h3>A Work-Free Way to Clean up Your Credit</h3>
While the three myths above won’t give you cleaner credit history, this can: Waiting it out.

Sometimes submitting disputes to credit bureaus or contacting companies doesn’t work at removing negative entries from your report. The same holds true for goodwill requests for deletion and pay to delete offers. If you find yourself in such a spot, sometimes waiting is your only option.

Most negative entries can remain on your report for up to seven years or ten years for bankruptcy. Once that time passes, you can look for the negative items to disappear.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

What should you do in the meantime? Make sure you pay any open accounts on time, as doing so can improve your credit despite the negative marks.

The more positive moves you make, the more you’ll be able to outweigh the negative that could stand out as red flags to lenders. Although unfavorable entries can remain on your report for years, the more time passes, the less effect they have on your score.","While you can clean up your credit report to see a quick increase in your score, there are certain myths you must avoid.

2598,"How To Financially Prepare For Your Baby Before They’re Born","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What do most people think of when preparing for their baby’s arrival? Material items like clothes and cribs. While those are undoubtedly important, you’ll need to complete some financial tasks to ensure that money is not an issue when your baby enters the world.

Here’s what you can do now in the pre-baby stage to make that addition to your family a financially smooth one.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Make a list of your expected costs.</h3>
Having health insurance won’t ensure that your baby’s arrival will be one that is entirely cost-free. You’ll need to anticipate as many costs as possible, so make an extensive list that includes items like:
<ul>
 	<li>Prenatal care</li>
 	<li>Labor</li>
 	<li>Delivery</li>
 	<li>Other bills</li>
</ul>
To make this list as accurate as possible, review your health insurance plan to see what’s covered. If you have any questions, contact your insurance provider or agent to gain clarity ahead of time.
<h3>2. Pick your pediatrician.</h3>
As you review your health insurance, make it a point to pick out your baby’s physician. They’ll likely have to see them within the first week of being born, so don’t delay in making this critical decision.

Ask around for recommendations on pediatricians. Once you have a few, double-check to see that they are part of your insurance network. You can verify this by calling your insurance company or contacting the clinic.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Review maternity or paternity leave policies.</h3>
Are you currently working? If so, you’ll want to review your company’s leave policies to see if/how you’ll be paid when you cannot work due to childbirth.
<h3>4. Make your pre-delivery budget.</h3>
Take the information from your list of health insurance coverage, expected costs, and leave to create a pre-baby budget.

You may feel tempted to buy expensive baby items that are cute and trendy. As long as your budget allows for such purchases, that’s fine. If not and money is tight, you’ll want to set limits on each department of spending to avoid exceeding your budget.
<h3>5. Make your post-delivery budget.</h3>
The costs will keep coming once your baby is born in the form of food, diapers and wipes, childcare, and the like. Make your post-delivery budget now, so you don’t experience sticker shock once your baby is born.

<h3>6. Get ready for a rainy day.</h3>
What can kids bring with them? Joy, but also emergencies as they explore their new world and let curiosity get the best of them. For this reason, check to see how much you have saved up for a rainy day.

If your emergency fund doesn’t equal three to six months of living expenses, now is the time to bolster it. Although it may seem tough to do if you’re pregnant, there are ways to accomplish this goal if you get crafty.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

Do you have old clothes collecting dust around your home? Sell them online via eBay or Poshmark for extra emergency fund cash.

2600,"How To Get A Free Thanksgiving Turkey","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

With the holiday shopping season upon us, you want to save as much money as possible so you can get the gifts you need. Every cent you can save counts, and one of the best ways to score substantial savings is via free Thanksgiving turkey.

Several stores give out free or highly-discounted turkeys around Thanksgiving. While this may not seem like a smart financial move, they do it for marketing. And they do it to entice you to spend on other items in their store.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The following list showcases ways in which you can get that complimentary turkey. If you do have success, remember that just one turkey may not be enough to feed all your guests.

A pro tip is to have one pound of turkey per guest. This will ensure everyone gets fed. To have some leftovers for sandwiches and the like, aim for 1.5 pounds per guest.

With that out of the way, here’s your free turkey list. Hopefully, some of these options are in your area:

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>ACME Markets</h3>
You could snag a free turkey big enough to feed 10 to 14 guests in the past from ACME. All you had to do was present the coupon and spend $100 on a transaction.

Check with your local ACME to ensure this promotion is still running.
<h3>Fareway Meat &amp; Grocery</h3>
Spend $50 or more at Fareway’s Famous Fresh Meat Counter, and you can get a free 14-pound basted young turkey.
<h3>Giant Food Stores</h3>
If you shop a lot at Giant, you could use reward points from your Bonus Card to get a free turkey. While this was last year’s promotion, pick up a weekly circular to see if they’re doing it again.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Hy-Vee</h3>
If you purchase a Hormel Cure 81 ham, you could get a free Honeysuckle turkey to give you two protein options on your table.
<h3>Safeway</h3>
Are you a Safeway Club Card member? If you make a $150 purchase, you could get a free turkey.
<h3>ShopRite</h3>
Have you been racking up points on your Price Plus club card at ShopRite? Depending on how many points you have, you could convert them into a free turkey or ham.
<h3>Weis</h3>
Shopping at Weis can pay off if you collect enough points. 400 points are usually enough to get a free turkey from this chain of grocery stores.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>WinCo</h3>
If there’s a WinCo near you, check to see if they’re still giving out free turkeys. Last year they did it if you spent $100.

Do you not see any local stores on this list? Contact your grocer to see what types of turkey deals they have going on. At the very least, you should find some discounts by asking around.

As you can see, stores get creative this time of year when it comes to holiday food promotions, and these examples show you the various ways people get turkeys without having to pay for them directly.

In short, don’t fret if your favorite store isn’t listed. A quick call could help you find exactly what you're looking for.","What’s better than turkey on Thanksgiving?

2603,"These Thanksgiving Tips Can Keep Your Holiday Costs Down","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3>Try Discount Stores</h3>
Your local grocery store may be your go-to for your turkey or ham, but a discount store like Aldi could be gold when it comes to your other ingredients.

Speaking of discount stores, you won’t find better savings than at dollar stores. While you may not see your favorite Thanksgiving foods there, you can use them for highly affordable decorations, napkins, cups, and the like.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Go Behind the Scenes with Local Stores</h3>
Smaller stores, like a local bakery, can lead to significant Thanksgiving savings.

For example, you could walk into your local bakery and ask when their bread will go on sale. What can you use it for? Homemade stuffing or other Turkey Day recipes.

You can do the same with meat at butcher shops, produce at local farmer’s markets, and more. As long as you’re not afraid to get friendly with these local stores, you should end up with some substantial, under-the-radar discounts.
<h3>Buy Turkey like a Money-Saving Pro</h3>
Get your turkey frozen, not fresh, to cut your costs. Only buy one pound of turkey per guest, so you avoid waste. And if you want some leftovers, change that number to 1.5 pounds per person.

There’s no need to buy multiple turkeys unless you’re hosting an army, either. If you need a little extra turkey just to be safe, snag some legs or breasts instead of forking over cash for a whole bird.

You should also see if your store has any promotions like, “Spend $100, get a free turkey” or “Cash in your rewards points for a free ham.” As unlikely as these discounts seem, they’re everywhere as stores try anything to get you to spend on other items.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h3>Keep Your Beverages Under Budget</h3>
Soda is more expensive than drink mixes, plus it doesn’t go so great with Thanksgiving food. Skip it, opt for powdered mixes like Crystal Light instead, and don’t forget to add affordable tea and coffee to your beverage list.

In terms of liquor, let your guests bring their own so they can satisfy their preferences and take the load off of you. And if you need wine, opt for the boxed variety and put it in another container. Nobody will know the difference.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Do Your Own Decorations</h3>
You can make your home as holiday-authentic as possible by using homemade decorations from your backyard that don’t cost a thing. Making them is a great way to bond with the kids while saving money in the process.

Grab some fall leaves and pinecones and use them around your home for a lovely autumn touch. Buy some squash that you can decorate with now and eat later.

As long as you’re creative and resourceful, you’ll see no need to pay for decorations, even if they’re super-cheap at dollar stores.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Make Those Leftovers Last</h3>
Whether you’re hosting Thanksgiving or visiting someone else’s home, you’re likely to have leftovers. These make perfectly good meals, and each will keep you from having to buy or cook something new.

If you’re tired of plain turkey, look up recipes online to repurpose it into a new, exciting dish. The idea is to use everything you have so you don’t have to dip into your wallet.","Are you worried that Thanksgiving will cut into your monthly budget? Try these cost-cutting tips, and you’ll have more than enough cash left over once the turkey’s gone.","2019-11-27 18:47:40",post,https://spaoa.org/?p=2603,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_672842527.jpg,shutterstock_672842527.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_672842527.jpg,2604,shutterstock_672842527,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_672842527.jpg,"Financial Help",_holiday,draft,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,these-thanksgiving-tips-can-keep-your-costs-down,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-01-19 19:29:14"
2605,"No Black Friday Budget? Here Are Better Times To Shop","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Taking care of children as a single parent can be tough as you do your best to meet monthly expenses. When does it get tougher? During the holidays, when gift-giving is the norm, and spending is expected.

Black Friday is a day that can ignite your urge to spend money you don’t have. As you’re bombarded with commercials both online and offline, you may feel pressured to purchase items just to fit in. Or you may do it to satisfy the needs of others.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Making this mistake can put a dent in your bill-paying budget. And if you load up on credit card debt, you could regret buying those Black Friday bargains for the rest of the year.

To keep this from happening, know that spending on Black Friday isn’t a must, especially if you’re looking to buy any of the following items.

What’s so special about them? They can be found at their cheapest during other times of the year, which makes skipping Black Friday not only acceptable, but also a smart financial decision.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>The Best Time to Buy Toys</h3>
Let’s start with what’s at the top of most single parents’ shopping lists, regardless of the month: toys. Can you find a ton of toys at slashed prices on Black Friday? Absolutely, but you can find them even cheaper later on.

Missing Black Friday is fine in the toy department, so if you have to buy them, wait a few weeks until the final days before Christmas. You should find even deeper discounts then.
<h3>When Winter Clothes Go on Clearance</h3>
What does everyone need when it gets cold out? Clothing like coats to keep warm.

It makes sense that you’d want to buy coats and other winter clothing on Black Friday, but here’s when you’ll find more affordable options: When winter turns into spring.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The demand for winter clothes is just too high during Black Friday. Retailers don’t really need to lower their prices to boost sales since such clothing is a need.

For this reason, stick with what you have. Once coats and the like go on clearance near spring, you can pick some up and save them for next winter.

<h3>When Is It Smart to Get a Smartphone?</h3>
If you’re on a super-tight budget, getting the latest iPhone probably isn’t a priority. If you would like to splurge on one and treat yourself or your kids, however, don’t get the latest, greatest phone on Black Friday.

There are certainly Black Friday deals on smartphones that can lead to savings. But if you’re looking for the lowest price possible for the newest edition of an iPhone, for example, you’ll have to wait a while.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

How long should you wait? Since Apple and other manufacturers have no problem creating buzz for their best phones, you should wait until the hype dies down.

In terms of the iPhone, that amount of time usually equates to nine months or more. So if you really need an iPhone, opt for an older model.","Don’t let the lack of a Black Friday budget make you feel guilty about not buying gifts.

2607,"Look Here For Savings After Cyber Monday","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

There’s no need to sob after Cyber Monday ends. Sure, the shopping holiday does offer sweet online deals, but you can still shop and save once those 24 hours are over.

The Internet makes affordable shopping super simple. Whether it’s via coupon codes, loads of competition that leads to lower prices, or comparison shopping, you can save without much work.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

One of the best ways to save is with apps and browser extensions. Today we’ll discuss one of the tops on the list, which goes by the name of Wikibuy.
<h3>How Wikibuy Helps You Save 24/7</h3>
Do you shop a lot on Amazon? Wikibuy can help you find the best price for the item you need in a matter of seconds. You can use it whenever you want, and it’s a great alternative to putting all of your eggs in the Black Friday or Cyber Monday basket.

Wikibuy can either be used as an app or an extension to your Chrome browser. As you search for an item on Amazon, Wikibuy will show you which retailer has it for the lowest price.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Does Wikibuy only work on Amazon? No, so you do have some flexibility here.

For instance, you could be shopping on Target’s website for a toy that your child has been bugging you to get. Not only will the app search for who has the best price, but it will also scan the Net for coupon codes you can use at checkout.

Can you search for the best deals on your own via Google? Of course, but with Wikibuy, there’s no need to.

Just shop as you usually do, and let the app do all the heavy lifting, no matter if it’s during the holiday season or the summer.

<h3>Bonus Tip: How to Get Easy Discounts from Online Shops</h3>
Here’s an online shopping trick that could result in some discounts down the line. While it won’t work with every online store, it’s a hack that can yield some savings, so it’s worth trying.

When you want to buy something online, put it in your shopping cart. Hopefully, you don’t need it right away, because keeping it in your cart is the trick that can trigger a discount.

Many online stores can tell when you put something in your cart but didn’t buy it. To entice you to finalize that purchase, they’ll send you a series of emails over a week or longer to get the sale. It also helps them retain you as a future customer that they can keep selling to.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

These abandoned cart sequences often come in the form of a reminder email, followed by a discount. The discount email may not come for a couple of days or a week, so as long as you’re patient, try this trick for yourself.

Once you have that discounted coupon code, you’ll see that the tricked work. You can then keep trying it every time you need to make an online purchase.","Cyber Monday isn’t the only day to find deals online.

You can get your family into a new, affordable, cost-efficient home via Habitat for Humanity housing. This is excellent news if you’ve tried the regular route of real estate agents and lenders to buy a new home with no luck.

Are Habitat homes free? No, as you will have to go through an application process and pay a mortgage on them if you qualify. Luckily, Habitat mortgages are often very affordable, and you could end up in a house that costs just $500 per month, depending on where you live.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What are the qualifications and application process like for Habitat homes? Let’s go over that now, using the Atlanta, Georgia, Habitat program as an example.

Since each Habitat affiliate operates with its own requirements, go here to find you the specifics for your area.

This article is just meant to be used as a quick guide to open your eyes to the possibilities of owning a Habitat for Humanity home.
<h3>An Example of Requirements for Habitat for Humanity’s Homebuyer Program</h3>
According to the Atlanta Habitat’s website, here are the basic requirements for homeownership:
<ul>
 	<li>You must either be a first-time homebuyer or fall under certain exceptions.</li>
 	<li>You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent legal resident.</li>
 	<li>The size of your household must be between one to eight people.</li>
 	<li>You must be willing to partner with Habitat, which means providing “sweat equity” that includes helping to build your home or somebody else’s. You may also be required to attend monthly homeowner counseling sessions and fill other responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Up next are the income requirements for Atlanta Habitat for Humanity housing. In general, you can qualify for the program as long as your steady income is neither too high nor too low.

Here’s how that sliding scale looks for the Atlanta area as it relates to gross annual income:

Family Size:
<ul>
 	<li>1 person: $24,840 to $44,640</li>
 	<li>2 people: $24,840 to $51,000</li>

Besides income, other financial factors could be considered, such as:

 	<li>A history of savings.</li>
 	<li>Decent credit history with an emphasis on overall payment history instead of score.</li>
</ul>
Atlanta’s Habitat program requires any past due non-medical debts to be paid down to a maximum of $400 before applying.
<h3>Habitat for Humanity Housing’s Approval Process</h3>
If you live in the Atlanta area, here’s what your approval process would look like. While it may be similar in other locations, be sure to check with your local affiliate to play it safe before applying.
<h4>1. Go to an information session.</h4>
Here you will learn about the program, get an information packet, and meet with a Habitat team member.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>2. Set up an application appointment.</h4>
After your meeting, a team member will contact you to set up an official appointment to fill out an application.
<h4>3. Complete your application.</h4>
Be sure to bring all the necessary documents to your appointment. If you forget any, you may not be able to proceed with the process.
<h4>4. Complete an interview in your home.</h4>
Members of the Habitat’s Family Selection Committee will conduct an in-home interview where you currently live to see if you qualify.
<h4>5. Get approved.</h4>
Once approved, you will have to attend an orientation and other classes, set up the deposit on your home, and start putting in those sweat equity hours (which total 250 in Atlanta).","Habitat for Humanity housing is an option many new homebuyers don’t even know exists.

2611,"7 Financial Moves To Make Once Your Baby Is Born","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Your baby has finally arrived, and while you may be overwhelmed with joy, worry may soon hit. Why? You start to think of your baby’s future and all the costs and unanticipated events that can come with it. And this causes you to panic.

Luckily, there’s no need to panic as long as you have a plan in place. So to make your newborn’s future and your mind as worry-free as possible, make sure your plan contains at least some variation of these tips:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Explore your childcare options.</h3>

Although you may tackle the primary task of caring for your newborn, you’ll reach a point where someone else will step in to help. Don’t wait for this point to arrive without a plan, as it can take weeks to find the right nanny or daycare. Instead, start looking at your options now so you can make the most informed choice as possible.

Before your maternity leave ends, interview nannies and visit daycare centers in your area. You can streamline this process by asking for recommendations from friends and family who can point you in the right direction.

<h3>2. Add your baby to your health insurance policy.</h3>

Even though most plans give you 30 days to add your child to your policy right after they’re born, don’t wait until the last minute to do so. If your baby gets sick, you’ll want to have coverage in place to avoid any issues.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Purchase a life insurance policy for your child.</h3>

This move is optional and tough to make, as no one wants to think about the possibility of losing a child. Still, you can use a term policy to have in place until your child is self-sufficient to give you added peace of mind.

Life insurance policies for children often have low rates, so don’t worry too much if your budget is already tight. The rates are low since they usually just cover funeral costs.

<h3>4. Add your child to your life insurance policy.</h3>

While buying your baby a life insurance policy right after they’re born is a solid move, you’ll want to add them to your existing policy, too, if you have one.
<h3>5. Create your will.</h3>

If you don’t already have one, now is the time to write your will, so you know your child will be taken care of if you or your partner pass.

Remembering to write or adjust your will after your baby is born ensures that you have control over their potential guardian instead of the courts.

<h3>6. Get disability insurance.</h3>

Life insurance can protect your family in the future should something happen, but what about now? What will you do if you can’t work for several months post-childbirth?

Disability insurance can help here, especially when it comes to supplementing your monthly expenses if you can’t work. Pick one out or make sure that your current disability insurance policy has sufficient coverage.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>7. Don’t put off your personal financial goals.</h3>

It’s easy to get distracted once a new baby is born. You may have started saving towards your retirement, but the latest addition to your family has put that goal on hold.

Even though a baby can be expensive, don’t let it take you off track. Continuing or starting to save for your retirement means your child won’t have to take care of you later on.","How can you keep your family’s finances in order during your baby’s first month and beyond?

In other words, having a baby is extremely expensive. With that expense comes tons of worry when you should be enjoying your baby’s arrival.

To reduce your costs and increase that enjoyment, have a look at this list of ways to score free baby stuff:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Get a free breast pump from the government.</h3>
The Affordable Care Act lives up to its name when it comes to free baby stuff. Once it was enacted, the program granted complimentary access to a breast pump for women with babies.

To see all the specifics and how to qualify for your free breast pump, visit the Healthcare.gov page on breastfeeding.

2. Get free baby stuff like diapers and formula from your doctor.

The next time you’re at the hospital or doctor’s office, ask if they have any free diapers, formula, or other baby supplies. Some will have them right on the spot, so you won’t have to look around or make any connections.

If they don’t have any free baby stuff, they will likely tell you of any organizations or clubs in your area that do.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>3. Get free baby formula from some of the biggest names in the business.</h3>
You’ll need plenty of formula to ensure that your baby gets all the nutrients it needs. As long as you’re willing to spend a few minutes online, you can get it for free.

Sign up for Similac’s StrongMoms Rewards program, and you’ll get formula samples that you can try before you buy. You’ll also get plenty of exclusive benefits and coupons that equal a $400 value.

Not to be outdone, Enfamil has something similar that they call their Family Beginnings program. Like Similac, signing up for it offers $400 in gifts and checks that work like coupons.

Enfamil offers formula samples that cover three stages of your baby’s journey. After trying their baby, infant, and toddler formulas, you’ll be able to tell if they’re what your baby likes and needs. Once you’re ready to buy them, use one of the free checks to get a substantial discount.

<h3>4. Entertain and educate your baby with free books.</h3>
Is your baby’s library lacking? Don’t fret, as there are several ways to score free baby books.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library will ship you free books from the time your child is born until they reach five years of age. This program has shelled out millions of books to kids around the world.

The Freekidsbooks.org website is another excellent way to grab no-cost education and entertainment for your baby. It offers free book downloads that you can use for years because it not only has baby books, but it also has titles for kids up to fifth grade.

2615,"Creative Ways To Enjoy Free Or Low-Cost Childcare","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As much as you may want to be the only one who takes care of your kids, there are times where you simply need help.

Maybe you need to run certain errands <a href=""https://spaoa.org/no-cost-education-resources-to-keep-your-kids-occupied-and-their-brains-sharp/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">where kids can’t tag along</a>. Perhaps you need to work at an upcoming job that you just got hired for. Or you maybe you’re just looking for babysitting help so you can have some time alone or head out to a social event.

Regardless of the why, let’s discuss how you can find childcare without breaking the bank.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Solicit the Help of Your Friends and Family</h3>
This option comes first because it can be the least costly and come with the most peace of mind.

Your loved ones know your struggle better than anyone else can. They know how important your kids are, but also how you may need time away from them to accomplish tasks. This is why before you look anywhere else, you should see if your friends and family can help with childcare.

Beyond the convenience aspect, you can leave your children with people you know best. In other words, you won’t have to worry about leaving them alone with strangers, background checks, expensive certifications, and the like.

What may have stopped you from asking those who you know if they can take care of your child? Worry that your request could seem like a burden.

If your children’s grandparents live nearby, they probably will look forward to taking care of them. The same holds true for those closest to you, so don’t feel bad about asking for the favor.

As for how friends and family can translate into free or low-cost childcare, there are several ways to do it.

For starters, you can ask for free help if they live very close, and you only need a few hours of care. If that’s not an option and you’re going out with a friend who also has kids, you could split the cost of a babysitter since you’ll both need one.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Speaking of friends with children, offer to take care of their kids from time to time. They can then return the favor when you need it for free or whatever low price you agree on.
<h3>Keep an Eye out for Special School and Community Programs</h3>
If your child is already in preschool, they may offer special parents' night out programs where they’ll take care of children at a very low cost or even free. While this won’t be routine care, every little bit helps.

Schools aren’t the only ones with such events, as churches, daycares, and other community organizations can do the same.

To find these forms of added help, you can personally ask people in the groups you’re associated with. You can also check the bulletin boards at churches or schools or the newspaper.

Last, but not least, scour social media. There may be Facebook groups of parents in your city who can point you in the right direction of convenient childcare opportunities.
<h3>Try Drop-Off Childcare Centers</h3>
Do you only need childcare for a few hours on an occasional basis? If so, you may not need costly daycare, and a drop-off childcare center may be your best bet.

[the_ad id=""2456""]<!-- Media.net -->

Unlike regular daycare, a drop-off center allows you to leave your child for a few hours while you complete your tasks. By only using them for a fraction of the time, you can cut your costs significantly.","Do you want to cut costs when it comes to caring for your kids?

The answer is to find places that offer free stuff for kids on their birthdays. It’s the best way to cut costs while keeping your child happy.

Several places offer these complimentary goodies, but note that you should prepare ahead of time to take advantage of them.

<h3>A&amp;W All American Food</h3>
This restaurant chain offers a menu full of foods any kid would love. Whether it’s burgers, chicken, hot dogs, or sweet treats, your child’s taste buds will be tempted here.

If you sign up for the A&amp;W Mug Club, your child can get a free root beer float on their birthday. Since floats are so filling, this gift is likely to fill their tummy, so you don’t have to splurge so much on an actual meal.
<h3>Baskin-Robbins</h3>
If a root beer float may be too rich for your kid’s taste, they’re sure to love some ice cream from Baskin-Robbins. Join the ice cream chain’s Birthday Club, and you can receive a free scoop of ice cream.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

It’s a great way to treat your child at no cost after you eat somewhere else. And if you want to satisfy their sweet tooth even more, the Birthday Club also offers a discount on ice cream cakes.
<h3>The Old Spaghetti Factory</h3>
If you love free stuff for kids, you’ll want to sign up for The Old Spaghetti Factory’s Kid’s Birthday Club as soon as possible.

As long as your child is 12 and under, they can enjoy a free kid’s meal on their birthday. Then you can take them to Baskin-Robbins after for that free scoop of ice cream and a discounted cake.

A free birthday meal isn’t the only benefit of this Kid’s Birthday Club, though, as they can also receive a free treat on their half birthday. Last, but not least, sign up and you’ll get exclusive members-only news all year that could reveal more discounts and savings on spaghetti.

<h3>Bob Evans</h3>
You’ll find loads of family food at Bob Evans, and it’s especially good with free stuff for kids on birthdays.

The Bob Evans Birthday Club gives kids aged 12 and under a free kids’ meal when you purchase an adult entrée. While having to spend may not be ideal, chances are you’ll be eating when your kid does, and Bob Evans does have some tasty homestyle meals.

<h3>Applebee’s</h3>
It varies by location, but when you sign up for Applebee’s Email Club, you can get a free birthday treat that should come in the form of a free appetizer, entrée, or dessert.

Before you head out, call your local Applebee’s to verify that the offer is still good.

2620,"3 Tips For Finding Single Parent Rental Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Does being the only provider have you feeling overwhelmed? If you can barely come up with the rent, it probably does.

You may have tried to get a second job to increase your income, only to find that childcare expenses are too high. And when it comes to loans from friends and family members, that isn’t an option either.

Well, before you worry about the rent any longer, know that there are still other ways to find help. Here are three of them that offer single parent rental assistance:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Charities and Nonprofits That Help Single Parents Pay Rent</h3>
We’ll discuss this avenue first since it’s often the quickest way to get help with paying your rent. Because if your family is close to being on the street, you don’t have any time to waste.

If you want some hands-on help here, you can try to find a local housing counselor that’s approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Most work for free and can help lead you to any charities or nonprofits that can help, even if you’re a non-citizen.

Are there no housing counselors near you? Don’t fret, as you can still find charities and nonprofits on your own.

Dial 2-1-1 on your phone or go to their website and enter your ZIP code or city and state. Once finished, you will be guided towards local charities and nonprofits that provide rental assistance for single parents, as well as other services.

After you find your local contacts, you will then have to go through a screening or application process to determine your eligibility.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Local Housing Agencies That Offer Single Parent Rental Assistance</h3>
While charities and nonprofits may be the quickest at helping you pay the rent, some cities or states can help within a couple of weeks.

This form of temporary assistance is helpful if you’re homeless or near eviction. You’ll need to contact your local housing agency to get it.

The agency may ask you screening questions to quickly determine your eligibility. If you pass, you will then have to apply and supply information/documentation regarding your income, assets, monthly expenses, etc.

Temporary assistance often lasts for only a few months, so the application process may not be as tedious as the next, more long-term option.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Getting a Housing Choice Voucher to Help You Pay the Rent</h3>
The slowest way to find single parent rental assistance is via a Housing Choice Voucher. The process can take months or even years to complete, and it often has a very long waiting list.

You can speed up the process if you’re currently paying more than 50 percent of your income in rent, living in substandard housing, or are homeless.

If accepted, your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) will release funds to your landlord directly every month. You will be expected to pay the rest.","You may find it tough to pay your family’s rent on your own.

2622,"Need A Free Dental Clinic? Start Your Search Here","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Why do most people avoid getting their teeth cleaned and other forms of regular dental care? It’s not because they fear the dentist’s chair, although that could be the case for some. Instead, most skip dental care because of the cost.

If you’re uninsured and need dental care as soon as possible, don’t fret. The following list of resources could help you find what you need, including a free dental clinic, so you don’t have to pay a thing.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Free dental clinics</h3>
We start the list with what you seek the most: completely free dental care. You have a few different options here, but availability will vary on where you live and your current situation.

There are nonprofit dental clinics in some cities like Atlanta and Nashville that help people who cannot afford dental care, do not have insurance, or have low incomes.

In some cases, you won’t have to pay for anything. In others, your dental bill will be based on your ability to pay.

You could do an online search for safety net dental clinics or free dental clinics in your city. You could also dial 2-1-1 on your phone and ask the operator for help.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Please note that while these free dental clinics can help fix your teeth when times are tough, that availability is often on a first-come, first-served basis.
<h3>2. Charities</h3>
National and state charities sometimes offer free dental care too. Whether or not they’ll serve children, adults, or both, depends on the charity itself.

Here are two charities that lead the way when it comes to free or low-cost dental care:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://adcf.net/attend-volunteer/"">Mission of Mercy</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://dentallifeline.org/about-us/our-programs/"">Dental Lifeline</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Dentists</h3>
Do you have a dentist who’s been treating you and your family over the years? If your financial situation has taken a sudden turn for the worse, talk with them to see what they can do.

Some dentists will offer free dental care in particular situations. As long as you are completely honest about your circumstances, you may be able to get the help you need. If not, they could refer you to another dentist who will be willing to volunteer their services at no cost.
<h3>4. Dental schools</h3>
They may not be free, but dental schools can give your teeth the attention they deserve at a reduced cost.

Dental students need hands-on training to graduate. They can get it by operating on patients willing to volunteer themselves in exchange for lower-cost dental work.

Should you expect the treatment to be of a lower quality than usual? Not at all, since licensed supervisors observe each student. Your appointment may take longer than average, however, since it is a form of instruction that could be in a class-like setting.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>5. Public dental clinics</h3>
The federal government gives out grants to certain local or state health departments to offer affordable dental care through community clinics. You can get exams, X-rays, fillings, and more through these clinics at a price that will often be in line with your income.","Don’t let a lack of money lead you to neglect your teeth.

2625,"These Government Assistance Programs Can Give Single Parents A Big Boost","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you’ve been worried about how you’ll put food on the table or keep a roof over your head, the government may be able to help. As long as you’re eligible, you can receive a helping hand via several government assistance programs.

Here are some of the programs that may help single parents the most:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>1. Child’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</h3>
Your children’s health is probably at the top of your priority list. What can keep you from ensuring they’re as healthy as can be? A lack of money, which could lead to a lack of medical coverage.

Luckily, CHIP can help here as it supplies low-cost or even free medical and dental care to children who are under the age of 19 and uninsured.

CHIP offers a host of services for children, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Medical care</li>
 	<li>Hospital care</li>
 	<li>Tests</li>
 	<li>Medical supplies</li>
 	<li>Regular check-ups</li>
 	<li>Dental care</li>
 	<li>Eye exams</li>
</ul>
With so many services offered, you won’t have to worry about your child’s health as long as you have CHIP by your side.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>2. Medicaid</h3>
Millions of low-income residents depend on Medicaid for their healthcare needs. While it helps to give free or low-cost care to adults, seniors, and pregnant women, it also covers kids.

Medicare pays over half of the births in the United States, and over 40 percent of its recipients are children.
<h3>3. Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8)</h3>
Beyond health, keeping a roof over your child’s head is probably another major priority. Thanks to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Section 8 program, you can achieve this goal.

A Section 8 voucher for rent can help you move into a safe home in a more suitable neighborhood for your children. In some cases, you can even get a voucher to purchase a home.

To learn more about this government assistance program, go here to find your local Public Housing Agency.

<h3>4. Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</h3>
While having a home where your child can safely rest is essential, so is keeping the lights on.

It can be tough to achieve this task if your budget is particularly tight, which is why LIHEAP is a must to keep your electricity bills current.
https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap

Should you qualify, you can get help with your monthly utility bills and even receive assistance with making your home more energy-efficient.
<h3>5. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h3>
Last, but certainly not least, you need to keep your kids fed. SNAP is a government assistance program many single parents use to make this happen.

Millions of low-income households use SNAP to help put food on the table. Once you qualify, you’ll be given a card that can be used as a debit card to buy groceries at stores and farmers' markets.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>6. National School Lunch Program (NSLP)</h3>
You don’t want your child to feel hungry in the middle of a long school day. With NSLP, you can tackle that hunger via low-cost or free lunches.","Raising children by yourself is a tough task.

<h3>What is Section 8 Housing?</h3>
More commonly known as “Section 8” in the past, the United States government’s Housing Choice Voucher Program was started to help low-income families, including those with single parents, pay their rent.

Section 8 has helped millions transition out of a life of poverty by moving them into less poor and safer communities. In the process, the program not only benefits single parents and children by improving their well-being, but it also reduces the financial load placed on other public projects.

A local PHA, or public housing agency, will use many factors such as household income and family size to determine who receives a voucher. With a voucher secured, a parent can then look for housing that meets their needs. If it meets the program’s standards, the family can then begin the moving process.

<a name=""Eligibility""></a>

<h3>How PHAs Determine Housing Voucher Eligibility</h3>
The thought of being able to move to a safer neighborhood and more beautiful home may have you ready to apply for Section 8 right now. Before you make that move, however, it’s best to know about the eligibility requirements for Housing Choice Vouchers.

By knowing what a PHA looks for when awarding vouchers, you can have a better idea of if you’re a good fit for Section 8 or not.

There are four major areas PHAs look at when determining voucher eligibility. Here they are:
<h4>1. Family size.</h4>
Don’t let the word “family” fool you into thinking you need plenty of people living in your home to be eligible for Section 8. Plenty of single parents in two-person households can qualify, and there are various situations that, in the government’s eyes, equal a family:
<ul>
 	<li>Displaced family – Have you been removed from your home due to government action? Has a natural disaster caused so much damage and destruction, you can no longer live in your home? Either way, you fall into the displaced category.</li>
 	<li>With or without children – Your child may be living in foster care or simply does not live with you. If this is the case, you can still qualify as a family without children.</li>
 	<li>Elderly family – Defined as a situation where the single family member or head of household, is over 62 years old. If two or more family members are over 62 or one member is that age or older and has a live-in aide, they also fall under this category.</li>
 	<li>Disabled family – If the single family member or head of household has disabilities, two or more people in the home have them, or one person has them and has a live-in aide, they are considered a disabled family.</li>
 	<li>Remaining member of a tenant family – As long as one person of a family receiving voucher assistance remains in the home, they fall under this category.
Single person – Anyone who doesn’t belong to the categories above.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Income.</h4>
The federal government initiated the Housing Choice Voucher Program specifically to help families with low incomes. This is why income limits were implemented as part of Section 8’s eligibility requirements. Being a single parent alone will not suffice if your income is too high for the program, and your local PHA will pay close attention to this part of your application.

An applicant’s income limits depend on where they live and the number of people that make up their family. Once determined, the PHA will categorize a family as either extra low income, very low income, or low income.

As a general rule, your family will need to earn less than 50 percent of the median income for your area to be eligible for a voucher. As for where the three income tiers come into play, PHAs are required by law to award 75 percent of their housing vouchers to extremely low-income families. By simply being in that lowest income tier, your chances of getting a voucher increase. This is critical since vouchers are limited.

What puts a family into the extremely low-income category? Making less than 30 percent of the local median income or the poverty line, whichever is more.

If you feel that your income may be too high for a voucher, remember that more family members allow for a higher income. So, if you’re a single parent with a stable income but support several kids, you could still qualify for Section 8. There is a maximum number of family members you can have, however. That number is eight.

Income limits can change every year. To get an idea of how much you can make according to where you live and your family size, go here. As you can see from the PDF, the more family member, the higher the acceptable income for eligibility.
<h4>3. Citizenship status.</h4>
Here’s where Section 8 eligibility can get a bit tricky. The government intended the program to solely help citizens and permanent residents. However, family members who are neither can still live in the home, even if you’re helping to pay for it with a voucher.

Will you get a full voucher value if you have non-citizens as part of your household? No. Instead, you will get a prorated voucher based on the number of citizens or permanent residents in the home.

While the voucher value may be lower, it’s still good to know you can receive assistance despite differing citizenship statuses under one roof. In short, even the non-resident family members can benefit indirectly.
<h4>4. Eviction history.</h4>
Some single parents may have an eviction history due to problems paying the rent on time. As long as you weren’t evicted due to drug-related criminal activity, however, you should be good to go.

Evictions due to drugs can keep you from being eligible for Section 8 for three years. You will have to wait that long to apply for assistance before even being considered for a voucher.

Now that you have a clearer picture as to what the PHA will look at when considering your Section 8 eligibility, let’s look at what the actual application process entails. Before jumping into applying, however, let’s see which documents you’ll need to have to show proof of income, citizenship, and more.

<h3>Documents You’ll Need to Apply for Section 8</h3>
Don’t wait until the last minute to collect all the necessary documents and paperwork needed to apply for Section 8. The list can be lengthy even for a single parent, but when you consider you’ll need the info for each family member, it can take even longer to round up everything that’s required.

The essential documents you’ll need to show identification or citizenship status for each family member include:
<ul>
 	<li>State or government photo ID</li>
 	<li>Driver’s license</li>
 	<li>Birth certificate</li>
 	<li>Passport (for non-U.S. citizens)</li>
 	<li>Social Security card</li>
 	<li>Immigration documents (for aliens and registered immigrants)</li>
 	<li>Signed immigration status verification</li>
</ul>
Once those are ready, it’s time to gather proof that you fall within Section 8’s income limits. Such documentation can be taken from:
<ul>
 	<li>Bank statements</li>
 	<li>Tax returns, W2 forms, pay stubs, and other proofs of income</li>
 	<li>Information on any assets you own</li>
 	<li>Social Security benefit verification letter</li>
 	<li>Documents from any public assistance benefits you receive</li>
</ul>
As hard as some of these documents may be to find, you will need them to complete the application process. Without them, approval may be impossible, as your PHA will have to verify that your income makes you Section 8-eligible.

While these financial documents are a must for eligibility and approval, they will also be needed to determine your voucher amount if accepted into the program. That voucher amount will determine what type of housing you can select for you and your children.

The authenticity of your documents is a must, as are any answers you supply on the application form. The PHA will cross-check with your bank, employer, and other local agencies to ensure the information you provided is correct.

<h3>Applying for a Section 8 Voucher</h3>
Receiving a Housing Choice Voucher can make life as a single parent much more manageable. It can relieve a huge burden off your back by giving you help with paying the rent in a safe, affordable home, or even a better neighborhood. For these reasons, you want to apply for Section 8 assistance as soon as possible.

If there’s one negative aspect of housing vouchers, it’s there’s a massive demand for them. Funds are not unlimited, either, so you could find yourself on a long waiting list even if you qualify.

Here are the necessary steps to apply for the Housing Choice Voucher Program:
<h4>1. Find the PHA in your area.</h4>
You’ll need to find your local public housing agency once you’re ready to apply for Section 8 officially. You can do so by going to this part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) website.

Once there, click on your state on the map. Then scroll down until you see your local office.
<h4>2. Determine your eligibility.</h4>
You cannot apply for Section 8 if you’re ineligible to receive its benefits. That’s why your PHA will determine eligibility from the start to see if you can proceed with the application process.

Your family size and income will be two of the most significant factors used to see if you’re eligible for a voucher, followed by citizenship status and eviction history.

Your family cannot make more than 50 percent of the median income for your area to be eligible. The maximum family size is eight people. Those seeking voucher coverage will also need to be citizens or permanent residents. Eviction history for drug-related criminal activity can disqualify you for three years.

All of these things will be reviewed to see if you’re a possible candidate for Section 8.
<h4>3. Get a Section 8 application.</h4>
If your family is eligible for Section 8 after reviewing all the factors above, you can now begin the voucher application process.

You’ll need to get a Housing Choice Voucher Program application to do this, and your PHA can help point you in the right direction.

You can get the application in person, through the mail, or online. Your options will depend on where you live, so ask your housing counselor what’s available.
<h4>4. Fill out the application.</h4>
Don’t rush when completing your Section 8 application. Even though you want to have it submitted as quickly as possible to get on the waiting list, taking your time to complete the form thoroughly is critical.

Make sure all of the information you submit is truthful and correct. Don’t leave out any details, either, as your status as a single parent could give you an edge in getting approved. Keep this in mind as you complete the application, so you do not rush and turn in something incomplete.

As for what you’ll have to submit, expect to provide information on the following for all of your family members that will be living in the household:
<ul>
 	<li>Date of birth</li>
 	<li>Mailing address</li>
 	<li>Phone number</li>
 	<li>Gross income</li>
 	<li>Criminal history</li>
</ul>
Do not forget to add any family members or skip them if you’re missing any information. The size of your family will affect your eligibility and the size of your voucher, if accepted. This, once again, touches on the importance of having all of your documents and paperwork ready when applying.

If you’re unsure about anything when completing the application, don’t hesitate to ask your housing counselor for help. Use their assistance as much as you can, as they should know the ins and outs of the application process to help you get approved.
<h4>5. Be prompt in submitting the application.</h4>
After you double and triple-check the application to ensure it’s complete and all of the information is truthful and correct, it’s time to submit it. Due to the lengthy nature of voucher waiting lists, don’t let a completed application sit around the house. The more you wait to turn it in, the longer it will be until you get help paying the rent.

Some PHAs allow submissions within a specific window. If you miss that window, you may be left waiting a long time just to apply again. Pay close attention to the due date so you can accelerate the process as much as possible.
<h4>6. Wait patiently.</h4>
Some Section 8 applications may take months to process. As frustrating as this may be, don’t forget how much a voucher could help you make ends meet as a single parent. In short, the wait will be worth it once you get accepted.

Once the PHA makes its decision, and you’re not rejected, you will be put onto a waiting list so that you can hopefully get your voucher as quickly as possible.

<a name=""WaitingList""></a>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>The Section 8 Waiting List</h3>
It’s unfortunate, but being eligible for Section 8 doesn’t lead to an instant voucher. Instead, it just means you get to sit on the waiting list until that government assistance becomes available. What’s the silver lining here? That at least you made the first cut and were not rejected.

The demand for government housing assistance is enormous. It’s much larger than the voucher supply, which makes long waiting lists a reality of the Section 8 process. While it’s not impossible, the cases in which people get immediate vouchers are extremely rare, so expect to wait.

For some single parents, this waiting period can be very tough, especially if they need rental assistance now. Before you get discouraged, stress the fact that even making the waiting list is hard to do.

Some PHAs, as explained earlier, have limited windows for submissions. Others close their waiting lists entirely if they become inundated with requests. The fact that you could be sitting on a waiting list is a positive, not a negative, due to all of these factors going against you.

If your PHA has a very long waiting list or they closed it, you can apply to other public housing agencies. Your PHA should have a list of alternatives so you can increase your chances of approval and decrease the required waiting time.

Speaking of decreasing your time on the waiting list, here are four situations that will do just that:
<ul>
 	<li>You’re homeless.</li>
 	<li>You’re living in housing that’s substandard.</li>
 	<li>The government or a disaster has involuntarily displaced your family.</li>
 	<li>More than half of your income goes towards rent.</li>
</ul>
If any of those situations apply, be sure to mention them to your PHA, as they can move you up on the waiting list and closer to that voucher.

<a name=""VoucherValue""></a>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>The Value of Section 8 Vouchers</h3>
Before you make any plans to live in Section 8 housing, know this: A voucher will not pay for all of your rent. You will be expected to pay some of the lease, which is equal to 30 percent of your family’s income or at least $50 monthly towards utilities and rent, whichever is higher. Once you pay either of those amounts, you can then count on the Section 8 voucher to cover the rest.

Does this mean you can just pay 30 percent of your income and pick any house you want? No, as the program has a payment standard or cap that each PHA sets. This standard ensures that the home voucher recipients select is moderately priced for the area.

You can choose a more expensive home than the payment standard. You will be expected to pay any difference in the rent out of your pocket, however.

After the PHA determines your voucher value, they will pay it to your landlord directly every month. You will have to pay the rest of the rent promptly.

<a name=""Picking""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Picking the Right Section 8 Housing</h3>
Many believe that getting approved for a Section 8 voucher limits you to living in subsidized housing projects. As long as the housing you pick meets the program’s requirements, however, you can choose an apartment, townhome, or even a single-family home for you and your children.

If you don’t want to move so your kids can stay in their current schools and you don’t have to find a new job, you can use your voucher to pay rent at your current residence if it qualifies.

What does it take for housing to qualify under Section 8’s guidelines? A host of factors will be looked at, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Access</li>
 	<li>A kitchen that works</li>
 	<li>Cleanliness</li>
 	<li>Space and security</li>
 	<li>Bathrooms that are sanitary</li>
 	<li>Indoor air quality</li>
 	<li>Light and electricity</li>
 	<li>No existence of lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Temperature control</li>
 	<li>Water availability</li>
 	<li>Structure and materials</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Proper trash disposal</li>
 	<li>The neighborhood</li>
</ul>
Those factors make up what is known as Housing Quality Standards (HQS). Your housing counselor should give you tips on what to look for so you can satisfy those standards. So you don’t search for homes that are way out of Section 8’s reach, you’ll receive information on the appropriate housing unit size for your family.

If all of this information seems overwhelming, know that you will have a minimum of 60 days to put your voucher to use either on your new home or current home. To make the move official, here are three things that will need to happen:
<ul>
 	<li>Your landlord will have to agree to accept Housing Choice Vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA will have to confirm that the home you chose abides by HQS.</li>
 	<li>Your PHA will have to confirm that your home’s rent is a rate that’s reasonable when compared to other homes in the area.</li>
</ul>
Once your home is approved, you will have to sign a lease with the landlord that’s at least 12 months long. The landlord may ask for a security deposit. It cannot cost more than one month’s rent.

Once your first contract is complete, the landlord can create a new one or allow you to keep living in the home on a month-to-month agreement.

<a name=""Responsibilities""></a>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>The Responsibilities of Being a Section 8 Tenant</h3>
Once you move into your Section 8 housing, you will have specific responsibilities to keep to continue receiving vouchers. Here are some examples:

Abide by the lease agreement.
Pay your portion of the rent on time.
Keep the housing unit in good condition.
Follow the requirements of the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
Tell the PHA if you have any changes in income or your family composition.
Abstain from bribery, drug offenses, fraud, or any other criminal activity.

The landlord will be expected to hold up their end of the contract as well. This includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Ensuring that the housing unit meets HQS.</li>
 	<li>Offering the home at a reasonable rent.</li>
 	<li>Following the lease agreement.</li>
 	<li>Receiving payments from the PHA.</li>
</ul>
The PHA will agree to pay the landlord the voucher value each month. It can stop those payments if the lease agreement or payment contract is not being followed. The PHA will also review your family’s composition, income, and home each year to ensure they meet the program’s standards.

Last, but not least, the HUD will transfer federal funds to the PHA so it can make timely voucher payments. The HUD will also let the PHA apply for more vouchers and pay them a fee for administering the Section 8 program, while also checking to see that they are following its guidelines correctly.

<a name=""Benefits""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How to Maintain Section 8 Benefits When You Move</h3>
Single parents can sometimes be forced to move. If this is your case, don’t worry, as you can still keep your Section 8 benefits when changing locations. Before doing so, contact your PHA to know where you stand. If you don’t, you could see a lapse in your assistance that could cause problems with your landlord.

You will be responsible for terminating the existing lease with your landlord. You will also have to make sure that your new housing passes HQS and is suitable for Section 8.

Moving immediately after receiving Section 8 assistance for the first time can be a bit complicated. This is because you’re supposed to live in your PHAs original service area for at least one year after getting voucher approval. If you are moving before the one year mark hits, you’ll need to talk with your PHA to ensure you’ll still be eligible for benefits.

<a name=""Owning""></a>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#Top"">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>Owning a Home via Section 8</h3>
The Homeownership Voucher Program can help you own a home once you’ve received Section 8 assistance. It does this by allowing you to put your voucher towards a mortgage payment instead of rent.

To be eligible for this program, you will need to be a first-time homeowner. No primary member of your family can own residential property, even partially. No family member will be able to have owned or partly owned their own home for at least three years, either.

If you’re interested in this program versus simply renting via Section 8, contact your PHA.

Valentine’s Day isn’t restricted to just romantic love, as love, in general, should be celebrated. This means that even if you’re single, you have plenty to be joyful about when it comes to love from your friends, family, and above all, your kids.

Of course, the lack of romance may not be the only thing preventing you from celebrating February 14th, as a lack of money may be your main reason for sitting on the sidelines. There’s no need to do that, though, as these money-saving tips are incredibly easy to implement.
[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h3>Have Fun With Friends</h3>
Chances are, you’re not the only person single on Valentine’s Day. Ask around your friends, see who else is single, and plan a non-romantic date to share the love you have for one another.

Should you go out to a bar or restaurant to celebrate? You could, but if so, try to do it the day before or after Valentine’s Day. It’s one of the busiest days of the year to dine out, so places will be packed and overpriced.

Plan a get-together at home, and you can still enjoy your friends’ V-Day company while spending a lot less.

You can cook up a nice meal, have some cocktails that don’t carry a huge markup, play board games, or just chat about love and life in general to pass the time.

By celebrating V-Day at home, you’ll realize that spending money doesn’t equal fun. And you’ll realize that it’s your company that matters most, not the setting or activity.
[the_ad id='2453']<!-- R4M-->
<h3>Enjoy the Company of Your Kids</h3>
The love for your children is hard to match, making it worth celebrating on this special day, regardless of your relationship status.

How can you have V-Day fun with your kids? By doing any of the following activities:
<ul>
 	<li>Make Valentine’s Day sweet treats at home instead of buying them already made.</li>
 	<li>Look through photo albums with your children to show how much love you shared in the past.</li>
 	<li>Create affordable Valentine’s Day arts and crafts before the holiday hits. On February 14th, hand them out to friends, teachers, and others in your community who may not have a Valentine.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Treat Yourself</h3>
Being single on Valentine's Day doesn’t mean you can’t celebrate or treat yourself to something nice. Does this mean you should buy a new car or go on a shopping spree at the mall?

Not necessarily. It just means you can find affordable ways to show yourself appreciation, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Make yourself a bubble bath with candles and music in the background to replicate a more expensive spa day.</li>
 	<li>Compose a letter stating everything you love about yourself. It’s a handy tool you can look at in the future to remind yourself of how special you are if times get tough.</li>
 	<li>Go on a date by yourself. It could be a dinner date, but going out on February 13th or 15th is a smarter move since it’ll cost less, be less crowded, and you won’t have to look at couples.</li>
 	<li>Satisfy your sweet tooth by buying chocolates or candy once Valentine’s Day is over. It should be deeply discounted and taste just as good.</li>

2632,"4 Major Myths About Habitat For Humanity Housing","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Knowing the basics about Habitat for Humanity is a must before you dive deeper into this helpful housing program. To help you achieve that goal, let’s look at some of the major myths that are floating around:
<h3>1. Habitat for Humanity homes are free</h3>
We kick off this list with the biggest Habitat myth around, which is that the program basically gives away houses for free.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Not only must you pay for your Habitat home via an affordable mortgage, but you must also invest your time and effort into the property while it’s being built. Lastly, you’ll have to attend counseling sessions and classes on homeownership to ensure you meet all of your house-related responsibilities.

The fact that you’re expected to pay a monthly mortgage, invest “sweat equity” into the building process, and attend classes, makes owning a Habitat home anything but free.

While this may seem a lot of effort just to move into a new home, know that many Habitat owners express feelings of gratitude for the opportunity. Not only does participating in the building of your home help you appreciate it more, but the financial education classes give you a solid foundation for your future that you can pass on to your kids.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>2. Habitat for Humanity discriminates and only selects certain groups of people for its homes</h3>
The program follows Equal Opportunity Lending and Fair Housing Laws. In other words, they do not discriminate based on:
<ul>
 	<li>Gender</li>
 	<li>Race</li>
 	<li>Religion</li>
 	<li>Sexual orientation</li>
 	<li>Nation of origin</li>
 	<li>Family or marital status</li>
</ul>
Whether you’re married or divorced, with or without children, or even single, Habitat invites you to apply for their efficient and affordable housing.

While they do not discriminate based on the factors above, Habitat will consider the following when determining your eligibility for the program:
<ul>
 	<li>Ability to pay</li>
 	<li>Willingness to partner</li>
 	<li>Need for housing</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Habitat for Humanity is only for people using government assistance</h3>
Although the program may help many low-income families meet their housing needs, not all of them are on government assistance.

Take a look at Minnesota Habitat homeowners, for example. One study found that only 26 percent used government assistance before buying their Habitat home. Even better, only three percent remained on assistance after buying their home.

By providing affordable mortgage payments, Habitat actually helps people move towards sustaining themselves.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h3>4. Habitat for Humanity homes are of inferior quality</h3>
The fact that Habitat homes have affordable mortgages does not mean they carry subpar construction. On the contrary, they must meet or surpass the building code of the communities they’re built in. They must also match the quality and size of surrounding homes.

You could say that Habitat homes are even built better than their counterparts. Since some receive federal grants, they must undergo more stringent inspections at city or county levels.

Even though the housing is built with the help of community members and volunteers, they are trained by professionals. Electrical, plumbing, roofing, and similar work is all done by licensed professionals too.
<h3>Contact Your Local Habitat for Humanity</h3>

2634,"Tips For Boosting Your Tax Refund As A Single Parent","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Raising children can be anything but affordable. Raise them on your own, and you may find yourself pinching every penny you can just to make ends meet.

Tax season can provide some financial relief if you know how to file correctly. What does filing “correctly” entail? Making sure you take advantage of the various tax breaks for parents.

We’ll take a look at the tax breaks in the form of deductions and credits that can help you maximize your refund. But first, let’s discuss some essential filing tips.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>Using Head-Of-Household Status to Your Advantage</h3>
Your filing status can have a significant impact on the tax rate you’ll pay. By filing as head-of-household versus single, you can enjoy a lower tax rate.

If you meet these three eligibility requirements, make it your goal to file as head-of-household to score those tax savings:
<ul>
 	<li>Your dependent lives with you for at least six months out of the year.</li>
 	<li>You contribute over half of the household’s financial support.</li>
 	<li>You’re unmarried on December 31.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Claiming the Child on Your Return and Not the Other Parent’s</h3>
If you’re separated or divorced, figuring out who can claim a child on their tax return can be a major issue.

How does the IRS determine who gets claiming rights? Several factors go into that decision, but one of the biggest ones is where the child sleeps.

If they sleep at your house for more than half the year, you have a solid case for claiming them on your return.

To get a clearer picture of this issue, visit the official IRS page for divorced and separated parents.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Tax Returns for Teenagers</h3>
If any of your children are in their teenage years and have a job, let them file their own tax return.

It gives them a good start with learning about taxes, and they’ll probably get a nice return once all is said and done that can be put towards college or down payment on their first car.
<h3>Tax Credits and Deductions for Single Parents</h3>
You may be able to use these tax breaks to snag some tax savings and maximize your return:
<h4>Child Tax Credit</h4>
You may be able to take advantage of the Child Tax Credit if you have kids under 17. Their eligibility starts the moment they’re born, and you could get up to $2,000 per child if you meet the income requirements.

To see if you’re eligible for this tax credit, go here.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Earned Income Tax Credit</h4>
The EITC can reduce how much tax you owe. It may even give you a refund.

There are income limits for this tax credit, and your filing status and number of children will also be taken into consideration.

You can learn more about the EITC by going here.
<h4>Out of Pocket Pregnancy Expenses</h4>
If you had a baby last year, you could get reimbursed for any related medical expenses that you paid out of your own pocket.

As long as the expenses exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income, you can list them as a deduction on your tax return.

2636,"The Lowdown On Low-Income Housing Vouchers","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Are you finding it almost impossible to pay your landlord on time? Have mounting bills pushed you to the brink of eviction?

Instead of getting stuck on the street, you can get help from the government to keep a roof over your family’s head. And that help can come in the form of a Housing Choice Voucher.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

If you’ve heard of Section 8 before, that’s the old name for this current low-income housing program.

To give you a better idea of how Housing Choice Vouchers work, let’s look at some of the program’s basics so you can get the clarity you need to start the application process.
<h3>A Quick Intro to Housing Choice Vouchers</h3>
As with Section 8, this low-income housing vouchers program was put together to provide families in need with housing that’s affordable, and even more important, safe.

What qualifies as a “family in need”? That depends on where you live and other factors, but a family in need is basically one that makes less than half of the median income for their location.

While funds are distributed locally by Public Housing Agencies or PHAs, it’s the HUD, or the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, that holds all of the money from the start.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>The Housing Choice Voucher Application Process, From Start to Finish</h3>
As mentioned, Public Housing Agencies are the ones who disburse funds from the HUD to low-income families. For this reason, you will have to locate your PHA, as they will be the point of contact during the application process.

To find your PHA, go here and click on your state on the map. On the next page, scroll down until you see your city and the PHA's contact information.

With the information in hand, you’ll need to make an appointment by contacting the PHA. The purpose of the meeting is to help you discuss your current living situation.

If it seems like you’ll qualify for a voucher, you can then start completing the housing application.

Pay close attention to what your housing counselor instructs you to do when making the appointment. They will tell you which documents you must bring and any other info that’s necessary to begin.

Although filling out a low-income housing voucher application may not be difficult, it can be time-consuming. You will have to list all household members’ information on things such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Income</li>
 	<li>Monthly expenses</li>
 	<li>Assets</li>
 	<li>Criminal history</li>
 	<li>And more…</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

It’s crucial to be as thorough and honest as possible when completing the housing application. If not, you could be disqualified and run into other issues.

If your application is not accepted, you can appeal the denial by stating your case. This may be necessary if you have an eviction in your past.

If your application is approved, you will be placed on a waiting list that may last months or years due to demand. You can reduce the wait if you’re currently homeless, live in unsafe or substandard housing, or pay over half your income in rent.

After the wait is finished and your voucher is issued, you will have to find housing that meets the HUD’s standards.

The home will have to be inspected, and if everything is fine, you can move in after signing a 12-month lease.

Monthly voucher payments will be sent from the PHA to your landlord, while you’ll have to cover any excess rent out of your own pocket.","Has paying the rent become a monthly struggle?

2638,"5 Reasons Why Now’s The Time To Learn About Telemedicine","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Has the coronavirus outbreak made you stop to think more seriously about your health? It probably has, and if you don’t have health insurance coverage, your days may start to be filled with worry.

The high costs of health insurance keep many people uncovered. But even though healthcare may be expensive, that’s no excuse not to look for better alternatives.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Telemedicine, which is sometimes referred to as telehealth, is one such alternative that can keep you healthy without breaking the bank.

To get you more familiar with this innovative method of treatment, let’s look at how telemedicine can change the way you look at healthcare.
<h4>1. Telemedicine gives you various ways to connect with health professionals from a distance.</h4>
With telehealth, there’s no need for in-person visits that take up your time and barely fit into your busy schedule. Instead of having to sit in a waiting room with other ill patients who could make you even sicker, you can now connect with medical personnel in several specialties via:
<ul>
 	<li>Wireless applications</li>
 	<li>Nursing call centers</li>
 	<li>Video conferencing</li>
 	<li>Patient portals</li>
 	<li>And more…</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Patient portals keep your confidential medical information secure.</h4>
Have you ever communicated with doctors via email after an in-person appointment? If so, you may have felt a bit worried about the possibility of confidential information being hacked.

Telemedicine uses patient portals that offer a safer alternative to email. Through them, you can perform a wide variety of functions without having to leave your home, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Get prescriptions refilled.</li>
 	<li>Schedule new appointments and get reminders about existing ones.</li>
 	<li>Review test results and summaries of past virtual visits.</li>
 	<li>Talk with your doctor or a nurse about any health issues you’ve been having.</li>
</ul>
Depending on which type of patient portal you use, you may be able to get all of that functionality and more in one spot, which can help simplify things and save you a ton of time.
<h4>3. Virtual doctor appointments can replace in-person visits.</h4>
Your health issue may be so severe that visiting a doctor’s office may seem like an impossible or even dangerous task. Or you may live far away from specialists who can treat your rare condition.

Regardless of the case, a virtual doctor appointment can help you consult with a nurse or doctor over video conferencing. In doing so, it eliminates the need for inconvenient in-person visits.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Doctors can monitor your health remotely with telemedicine.</h4>
Several telehealth technologies make it easy for doctors to monitor your progress from a distance.

For instance, doctors can use devices that measure your blood pressure and blood glucose and transmit data wirelessly. They can also use home monitoring devices that detect falls in elderly patients with dementia.
<h4>5. Telemedicine health apps make storing your medical information simple.</h4>
Instead of using old school paper files like some doctors’ offices still do, health apps can keep all of your information in a single, secure place.

While these apps can help perform tasks like recording vital signs and measuring caloric intake, the fact that they keep such information organized and secure is even more valuable.","If you haven’t heard about telemedicine before, there’s no better time than now to know what it is and how it can help you.","2020-03-16 17:29:52",post,https://spaoa.org/5-reasons-why-nows-the-time-to-learn-about-telemedicine/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_736694506.jpg,shutterstock_736694506.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_736694506.jpg,2639,shutterstock_736694506,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_736694506.jpg,Resources,Education,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,5-reasons-why-nows-the-time-to-learn-about-telemedicine,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:03:33"
2640,"4 Reasons To Start Using Telemedicine For Your Healthcare Needs","Here’s why telemedicine may be a better healthcare option for you now and in the future.

[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What will most people do now as soon as they see a few flu-like symptoms? First, they’ll probably panic, which is perfectly acceptable considering the coronavirus scare. And second, they’ll probably do everything they can to get a doctor’s appointment or visit the emergency room.

Such moves can be harmful in more ways than one, as you could put others in danger or make your situation worse. You can also overwhelm healthcare facilities with false flags when they could be helping people with more severe conditions instead.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Although these issues will be worse now, they should make you consider alternatives to traditional healthcare.

For instance, if you contracted a nasty flu, wouldn’t you rather get the care you need without leaving your home? And wouldn’t you rather pay less for it in the process?

Of course, you would, which is why it’s time to take a stronger look at telemedicine (aka telehealth) for you and your family’s needs.
<h3>How Telehealth Works</h3>
Just like some people telecommute and work from home via the phone or Internet, telehealth uses the same technology to connect medical professionals and patients.

If you’re sick or need some type of care, you can find the medical professional you need and consult with them over the phone or video chat to find the proper cure.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Reasons to Consider Telemedicine</h3>
<h4>1. Telemedicine can be more affordable than traditional healthcare.</h4>
Some telehealth plans can cover your entire family for a very affordable monthly amount. Depending on the telemedicine provider you choose, you may get 24-hour access to physicians, deep discounts on medications, and much more.

For someone who is sick of paying a lot for traditional healthcare coverage, switching to telemedicine could be a substantial money-saving move. But you don’t just save money on the plans, you also save it by not having to leave your home, which we’ll discuss in this next point.
<h4>2. Telemedicine is more convenient than going in person.</h4>
If you work a regular job or have a hectic schedule, visiting the doctor’s office can be quite inconvenient.

You’ll have to waste time and money on transportation to get there. And you may also have to sit in a waiting room with other people who are sick, which doesn’t help either.

As an example, think of the issues that could come from going to the doctor with coronavirus floating around. Most medical professionals urge you to stay home if you feel ill, and sitting in an office could put others at risk while making you sicker.

Use telemedicine instead, and you can talk to a doctor over the phone or secure video chat, describe your symptoms, and even get a prescription while sitting in bed.
<h4>3. Telemedicine can give you more options.</h4>
When it comes to healthcare, you’re often limited by where you live. If you live in a small town, you’ll have fewer options when it comes to healthcare providers compared to someone in a big city.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Telehealth changes that by letting you connect via technology and eliminating the need for in-person visits that can leave you with limited options in your location.
<h4>4. Telemedicine helps you make more informed decisions about doctors.</h4>
Some telehealth services offer reviews for their members so they can see which doctors are the best in their field. You can use these reviews to pick a professional who gives you the most peace of mind, which is a must whenever a scary medical issue arises.","You can expect doctors’ offices and hospitals to get overloaded as coronavirus panic spreads.","2020-05-12 19:08:53",post,https://spaoa.org/4-reasons-to-start-using-telemedicine-for-your-healthcare-needs/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1253042272.jpg,shutterstock_1253042272.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1253042272.jpg,2641,shutterstock_1253042272,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1253042272.jpg,"Financial Help",_redirect|_welcomehome,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,4-reasons-to-start-using-telemedicine-for-your-healthcare-needs,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-18 13:38:53"

<h4>Your Utility Companies</h4>
Food and shelter are essential, but so are your utilities. And if you’ve lost your job or have seen a reduction in income, you may be wondering how to keep the lights on and your water running.

Some utility companies have vowed to avoid shutoffs during the coronavirus outbreak. If yours aren’t and are expecting on-time payments despite COVID-19, you’ll need to contact them as soon as possible to negotiate an arrangement.

Explain your hardship in detail. Describe any changes to your employment or income that currently make it impossible to pay your bill.

You may be able to negotiate postponed payments, which can keep your household functioning normally while you figure out ways to fix your finances.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Your Children’s Schools</h4>
Many parents got hit with an unexpected and unwelcome surprise when they found out their school districts were shutting down due to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While this announcement created a scramble for childcare, it also created a meal gap for children from low-income families.

Despite school shutdowns, many districts are still offering free meals for qualifying children. Contact your district to see if they provide this service, as it could provide a massive help while your budget’s currently constrained. Doing so could help you solve the issue of providing breakfast and lunch for your kids.
<h4>Modest Needs</h4>
Hourly workers are some of the hardest hit by the coronavirus’s adverse economic impact. Modest Needs is doing its best to combat this problem by starting a fund for hourly employees hardest hit by COVID-19 cutbacks.

Beyond that specific fund, Modest Needs has also helped low-income families pay their utilities, medical bills, and rent. To see if you qualify for any assistance, click here to visit their website, where they offer instructions on how to apply for a grant.

To see how 211 has responded to the coronavirus pandemic, visit this page, where they offer information on health insurance, unemployment benefits, the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and even reduced-cost Internet access.

The latter can help greatly since many kids are expected to continue their education at home until schools open once again.","Whether you need help finding food or paying your bills during the COVID-19 outbreak, this list can point you in the right direction.","2021-08-01 00:50:35",post,https://spaoa.org/go-here-to-get-food-and-financial-assistance-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1113586301.jpg,shutterstock_1113586301.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1113586301.jpg,2643,shutterstock_1113586301,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1113586301.jpg,"Benefits Assistance","_redirect|_welcomehome|Food Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,go-here-to-get-food-and-financial-assistance-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-10 14:05:09"

But there’s a silver lining that could lower your monthly costs, and it comes in the form of a letter you can write to your landlord.

With the entire world at a virtual standstill due to COVID-19, most people seem to be in the same boat when it comes to income. Jobs have been lost, pay has been reduced, and monthly budgets have been slashed.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

All of these negative effects of the coronavirus could work in your favor when dealing with your landlord, though. And if you play your cards right, you could lower your rent now and in the future by writing a simple letter.
<h4>A Letter to the Landlord to Lower Your Rent</h4>
As its name suggests, the purpose of this letter is to convince your landlord to reduce your rent. How will you convey your argument? By listing the reasons why your rent should be lower.

When’s the best time to write this letter? It usually comes a month or two before your lease is about to end, as this is when you’re often required to tell your landlord your intentions. Since they’ll probably want you to renew your lease, you can use the letter to lower rent to negotiate before signing anything.

While writing this letter is often done near the end of a lease, the coronavirus scare allows you to write it sooner due to factors like job loss and a loss of income. Since most sectors of the economy have been impacted, arguing for a more affordable rent could seem perfectly reasonable.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Tips to Bolster Your Rent-Reducing Argument</h4>
Before writing your letter to the landlord, do your research. Be sure to include every relevant detail of your situation as well.

Discussing issues with your income and job outlook may work in your favor. Using other factors, however, may help you even more.

For instance, ask your neighbors what they’re paying for rent. Look online to see comparable rents in your area. Are they lower? If so, you can use that to convince your landlord to reduce your monthly payment.

Vacancies are also relevant. If real estate isn’t moving in your area, your landlord may want to keep you in the property, even if it’s at a lower rate, versus putting it back on the market.

<h4>Use This Rent-Reducing Letter to Landlord Template</h4>
Plug in your information in the template below, proofread it, and send it off to your landlord. This simple act could give you more wiggle room in your budget.
<blockquote><em>[Your name]</em>
<em>[Your address]</em>
<em>[Your phone number]</em>
<em>[Your email address]</em>

<em>[Landlord or property management’s name]</em>
<em>[Address]</em>

<em>Re: Request to Lower Monthly Rent Payment</em>

<em>I am writing in reference to my lease at [Your address].</em>

<em>I moved into the property on [The date your lease started]. My lease ends on [The date your lease ends].</em>

<em>I noticed that [write about lower rents for comparable units in the area, vacancy rates, or cheaper deals offered by similar complexes].</em>

<em>For these reasons, I am asking that you reduce my rent from [what you currently pay per month] to [what you want to pay per month].</em>

<em>I enjoy living in the property, but for the reasons listed above and [describe any losses in income or job loss due to the recent coronavirus impact], I feel that it would be unreasonable or difficult for me to continue paying the current rate.</em>

<em>I have [list ways in which you’ve been a good tenant, such as paying rent on time, keeping the unit clean, etc.] I hope to continue living here should you accept my offer.</em>

To help you eliminate these expenses, I am willing to [sign a longer lease, pay a higher security deposit, etc.] if you agree to reduce my rent now.</em>

<em>If you have any suggestions on how we can come to an agreement, please let me know. I love my unit, enjoy dealing with you as my landlord, and would love to stay right where I am instead of moving somewhere more affordable.</em>

Here’s a collection of some of the information that’s currently available on this economy-boosting plan:
<h4>1. Payments seem to be set at $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.</h4>
Although the $1,200 amount can fluctuate if your income is too high.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. The income requirements allow for some leeway.</h4>
As an individual, you are eligible for the full $1,200 coronavirus stimulus payment if you make less than $75,000 per year. If you make up to $99,000 per year, you’re still eligible. Your payment will drop by $5 per $100 in income above $75,000, however.

Married couples qualify for the full $2,400 amount if their adjusted gross income is less than $150,000 per year. A couple can earn up to $198,000 per year and still qualify, but their payment will drop on a sliding scale.

A person who files as head of household, which is usually a single parent with children, is eligible for a $1,200 check as long as they make less than $112,500 per year. A check for less than $1,200 will be awarded to a head of household making up to $136,500 per year.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

In addition, they will receive a $500 check for each child under the age of 17.
<h4>3. You’ll have two options for receiving your coronavirus relief payment.</h4>
The government will disburse stimulus payments via check or direct deposit. Checks are expected to take longer to process.

You will get a direct deposit if you already filed a 2019 tax return. The IRS will use the deposit details you provided for payment. If you still haven’t filed for 2019, 2018 tax return data will be used to determine if you qualify for the stimulus, plus your method of payment.
<h4>4. The government is moving as fast as it can to process payments.</h4>
The week of April 6 is when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expects COVID-19 stimulus funds to go out. This timetable is extremely aggressive, however, and it could get delayed until the end of April instead.

<h4>5. Social Security does not disqualify you.</h4>
As long as your total income is below the limit, you can receive the COVID-19 relief payment. People on disability and retirees can be eligible.
<h4>6. There may be another round of payments later on.</h4>
If the economy is still struggling, there could be more coronavirus stimulus payments distributed in the summer. All will depend on the progress in fighting the outbreak and how quickly businesses can start to open up once again.
<h4>7. The payments are not taxable.</h4>
Your 2020 income is what really determines eligibility for a COVID-19 relief check. Since this year’s income is still undetermined, 2018 and 2019 are being used to qualify recipients.

If you end up making a lot more money in 2020 than the year that was used to determine your stimulus eligibility, you may have to pay back some of the awarded funds by April 15, 2021.

Not many people are expected to end up in such a situation, but it could happen.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>8. You may not be eligible for $1,200, even if you just lost your job.</h4>
There may be some help on the way for those who lost their jobs due to coronavirus layoffs. At this exact moment, though, you may be out of luck if your income was too high during 2018 or 2019, at least as far as the $1,200 checks are concerned.
<h4>9. Most people are expected to qualify.</h4>
The American Enterprise Institute predicts that 83 percent of tax filers (approximately 125 million people) will get relief payments. Groups who won’t get a check include very high earners, nonresident aliens, and dependents who are already claimed on the tax returns of others.
<h4>10. The IRS has created a page for updates on the COVID-19 stimulus.</h4>

2654,"Find Out Who’s Checking Your Credit Report","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Who could be peeking at your score? Find out the answer to that now.

Your credit report displays a history of your payment habits. It shows whether you made payments on time or not, as well as how many loans or credit cards you’ve taken out in the past.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

While this information can give you insight into your behaviors as a borrower, it can do the same for companies looking to do business with you. By seeing your history, lenders or creditors can decide whether or not you’re a worthy borrower and how much they should charge you for a loan.

Although it’s probably no surprise that a company would pull your credit before lending you money for a car, for example, other companies want to see your score too. Here they are:
<h4>Potential Lenders and Creditors</h4>
Have you ever tried to buy a car or home with a loan? If so, you know that those potential lenders checked your credit report.

After viewing your payment history and seeing how much outstanding debt you have, the lenders or creditors can come up with an appropriate loan amount and interest rate, if approved.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Current Lenders and Creditors</h4>
Merely getting a loan or credit card doesn’t mean that the lender or creditor stops looking at your history. In fact, many loan terms tell you that they’ll be checking your credit periodically to see if any changes should be made.

If a lender or creditor sees that your credit report has new negative information, they could use that to lower your credit limit, increase your interest rate, or close your account altogether.
<h4>Debt Collectors</h4>
When you run into trouble and can’t pay a debt, collectors may look at your credit report to see where you stand. They can then use that information to determine if you can pay them or not.

They may also use the information on your report, such as our address and employer info, to find out ways to contact you, so you pay.

<h4>Employers</h4>
Some job interviews involve more than just questions about your strengths and weaknesses. Depending on the position, your potential employer may check your credit report to see if you’re worth hiring.

A current employer may check your credit too. They’ll do it if they need extra information before giving you a promotion. Account delinquencies and bankruptcies are two red flags employers tend to look for.
<h4>Government Agencies</h4>
Before qualifying for public assistance, a government agency may check your credit to determine eligibility. Other agencies could check your report if you need to apply for a government license or must make child support payments.
<h4>Utility Companies</h4>
All companies, even those that provide necessities, want to ensure you can pay them on time. Some utility companies will check your credit for this reason. If they find that your score is less than ideal, they may require a security deposit.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Insurance Companies</h4>
You may be the perfect driver, but a less than ideal credit score could lead to you paying higher insurance rates.
<h4>How to See Who’s Checked Your Credit Report</h4>
To find out who’s been looking at your score, look no further than your credit report. You can get one per year for free, and it will show you who’s looked at it in the inquiries section.","Just because you haven’t checked your credit report in a while doesn’t mean nobody else is looking at it.","2020-04-09 16:37:50",post,https://spaoa.org/find-out-whos-checking-your-credit-report/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_495516409.png,shutterstock_495516409.png,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_495516409.png,2655,shutterstock_495516409,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_495516409.png,"Financial Help",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,find-out-whos-checking-your-credit-report,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-18 13:43:24"

If you are one of them, here are some resources that can help you stay on your feet via cash assistance, healthcare, utilities, and food.

<h4>Replace Your Income With Help From the Government’s CARES Act</h4>
Local governments forced many “non-essential” businesses to close for several weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. This has led to reduced income, fewer hours, or complete job loss for many.

Since we still don’t know when things will get back to normal, the government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to keep people afloat.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Why is this so crucial? Because if you qualify, you could receive two significant <a href=""https://spaoa.org/need-quick-cash-go-to-these-sites-for-gigs/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">boosts to your bank account</a>, with the first coming from a $1,200 stimulus check.

Single people and heads of households can qualify for a $1,200 check if their adjusted gross income is less than $75,000 and $112,500, respectively. Couples, meanwhile, can get a $2,400 check if their combined income does not surpass $198,000.

If you exceed those income amounts, you may still qualify for a lower payment than $1,200. The max income for individuals is $99,000, heads of households $136,500, and couples $198,000.

Who does not qualify for these stimulus checks, which will use 2018 or 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility?

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<ul>
 	<li>Dependents already claimed on tax returns</li>
 	<li>Anyone without a Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Nonresident aliens</li>
</ul>
Stimulus checks are just one way in which the CARES Act can boost your income, as unemployment benefits are another.

You can call on your state for unemployment assistance by using the CareerOneStop from the U.S. Department of Labor. And while, per the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average state benefits amount to $385 per week, you can receive even more through the CARES Act.

As long as you are an “unemployed person,” the CARES Act will give you $600 in benefits per week for up to 13 weeks. Best of all, that’s in addition to your state’s unemployment benefits.

In other words, if you receive the average unemployment assistance through your state of $385, when combined with the $600 from CARES, you could earn $985 per week.

What does it take to qualify as an unemployed person under the CARES Act? One of the following circumstances that occurred in response to the coronavirus outbreak must apply:
<ul>
 	<li>You were furloughed.</li>
 	<li>You were laid off.</li>
 	<li>You have proof of missed employment or income.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Healthcare Coverage If You’ve Lost Your Job</h4>
As mentioned, many people have been either furloughed or laid off due to COVID-19. This can result in issues with healthcare coverage, which can be fixed via one of the following avenues:
<ul>
 	<li>COBRA Continuation Coverage</li>
 	<li>Medicaid</li>
 	<li>Medicare</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Assistance With Paying Your Utility Bills</h4>
If you don’t have enough money to pay your utility bills, contact your company directly to work out a payment arrangement. Some companies have decided to delay billing in response to COVID-19, which would eliminate the need to contact them.

You can get utilities help from the government, too, if you qualify for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).
<h4>Ways to Get Food on a Reduced Income</h4>
Many local charities, churches, and food pantries have stepped up to the plate to help families get fed during the current outbreak. You can do an online search for such services in your city, or call 211 for additional assistance.

Also, the government has food programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and SNAP for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) that may be able to help on a more consistent basis.","The COVID-19 pandemic has left many people with no jobs and a tremendous loss of income.","2021-05-26 05:45:31",post,https://spaoa.org/use-these-resources-to-stay-afloat-in-these-tough-times/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1657935334-1-1.jpg|https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_69434938.png,shutterstock_1657935334-1-1.jpg|shutterstock_69434938.png,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1657935334-1-1.jpg|/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_69434938.png,2657|2658,"help staying afloat|shutterstock_69434938",|,|,|,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1657935334-1-1.jpg,"Work From Home",,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,use-these-resources-to-stay-afloat-in-these-tough-times,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-08-18 14:26:58"
2659,"A Closer Look At CVS’ And Walgreens’ Drugstore Rewards Programs","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Does it seem like the prices of goods and medications keep going up while your income stays the same? It probably does, but luckily, some well-known pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens have instituted drugstore rewards programs to help you keep those costs down.

Today, we’ll look at what both stores’ programs have to offer so you can see which fits your needs better.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>How Does a Drugstore Rewards Program Work?</h4>
These programs basically work by rewarding loyalty. Since competition is so stiff, stores need to do everything in their power to keep their customers back, which is what rewards programs do by providing incentives.

While each store’s rewards program has its unique differences, most work similarly.

You begin by signing up for free. You then rack up points by performing specific tasks like getting vaccinated or having your prescriptions filled, making purchases, or even doing things to improve your health, such as logging your blood pressure, quitting smoking, or exercising.

The more points you accumulate, the more discounts or reward dollars you can enjoy, which can be used to make other purchases through the store.

Before we jump into the features of each drugstore rewards program, note that they may not be available in every state, so check with your nearest store for details. Also, there may be exclusions as to how rewards accumulate and what they can be used for, as the following are usually off-limits:

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<ul>
 	<li>Alcohol</li>
 	<li>Tobacco</li>
 	<li>Lottery tickets</li>
 	<li>Money orders</li>
</ul>
Lastly, points/rewards may differ from those listed and are subject to change. As always, read the fine print before you proceed.
<h4>CVS ExtraCare Pharmacy &amp; Health Rewards</h4>
As soon as you sign up for this drugstore rewards program, you’ll be able to earn ExtraBucks Rewards that can be used to purchase items either in-store or online. Every 10 credits earned translate to $5 in ExtraBucks Rewards that expire at the end of the year.

Here are some of the specifics on the program:
<ul>
 	<li>A 90-day prescription earns three credits.</li>
 	<li>Filling or refilling a prescription earns one credit.</li>
 	<li>Vaccines like flu shots earn one credit.</li>
 	<li>Signing up for prescription text alerts or reminder emails for refills earns one credit.</li>
 	<li>You can earn $5 in ExtraBucks by filling 10 prescriptions (doing so at a CVS Pharmacy in Target will earn you a $5 Target coupon).</li>
 	<li>If you add prescription management to your CVS online account, you’ll earn three credits.</li>
</ul>
As you can see, rewards can start to stack up. There is a maximum of $50 ExtraBucks Rewards you can earn in a year, however.

<h4>Walgreens Balance Rewards</h4>
Walgreens takes a bit of a different approach with its rewards program. While it does give you 10 points per dollar spent in-store and online, it adds some health-related incentives as well through its healthy choices program.

Here are the highlights:
<ul>
 	<li>Points can be used for discounts on qualifying items at Walgreens and Duane Reade.</li>
 	<li>1,000 points = $1 that you can use on new purchases.</li>
 	<li>30-day prescriptions and immunizations earn 100 points.</li>
 	<li>90-day prescriptions earn 300 points.</li>
 	<li>Syncing your healthy choices account with an activity app/tracker earns 250 points.</li>
 	<li>You can earn 250 points by pledging to stop smoking, plus 20 points daily to track your progress.</li>
 	<li>Quitting smoking earns 250 points.</li>
 	<li>Each mile that you run, walk, or bike earns 20 points.</li>
 	<li>You can earn 20 points per day by logging your weight, blood glucose, blood pressure, or sleep activity.</li>
 	<li>The number of points that can be earned per activity is limited.</li>
 	<li>Linking your AARP membership earns 50 points per dollar spent on Walgreens-brand products.</li>
 	<li>Points expire after 12 months or for account inactivity after six months.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Discounts on Gift Cards From CVS and Walgreens</h4>
While their drugstore rewards programs are popular, shoppers also love to purchase gift cards from CVS and Walgreens. They make a quick, convenient gift, as you don’t have to shop for presents in person. Simply give that special someone a gift card, and they can use it to buy what they desire at either drugstore.

You can also buy gift cards right from the comfort of your couch, with savings that can help you keep more money in your pocket.","Want to stretch every dollar you spend at the drugstore as much as possible?

2661,"5 Tips To Turn This Time At Home Into Income","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>1. Sell stuff sitting around your house.</h4>
As you’re sitting at home, you may have noticed that you have a lot of things you don’t use. Instead of throwing them away while you declutter your house, you can sell them online for some extra cash.

Electronics like video games, computers, and cameras tend to sell well on eBay. Clothes, meanwhile, can be sold with ease via Poshmark.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Do you have an old tablet or cellphone that is collecting dust? Head over to Gazelle and sell it there. You can even sell an old wedding dress for a decent chunk of change on StillWhite, which shows you that there’s a market for almost anything.
<h4>2. See if you have unclaimed property.</h4>
You may have money out there just waiting for you to claim it. Visit Unclaimed.org, and you can see if there are any checking or savings accounts, stocks, refunds, trust distributions, and more in your name.

Be sure to check the site for every state you’ve lived in. Even if you’ve moved around a lot, the process only takes a few minutes to complete, and it could result in a nice payday.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Provide childcare or similar services.</h4>
COVID-19 caused schools to close, leaving many parents wondering how they would take care of their kids. While most non-essential businesses have shut down, “essential” workers still have to head out, leaving a childcare gap that you can help to fill.

If you know anyone who is still working and has kids, offer to take care of them for a fee. And if you don’t know anyone in need of such a service, a site like Care.com can connect you with people willing to pay for any of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Babysitting</li>
 	<li>Senior care</li>
 	<li>Pet care</li>
 	<li>Tutoring</li>
 	<li>Housekeeping</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Teach online.</h4>
Do you have a particular skill or experience that others would pay for? For instance, are you a fantastic cook that can teach others how to make mouthwatering meals at home? Or do you know incredible fitness routines to help people get in the best shape of their lives? Regardless of the skill or topic, you can leverage it into income via Symposium.

Think of the app as a hybrid of Facebook Live and YouTube that lets you give one-on-one or group presentations where you can charge a fee.
Hold a one-hour cooking class for 20 people at $5 each, for example, and you can easily make $100 per hour.
<h4>5. Work part-time for companies that need workers.</h4>
As mentioned, there are still businesses open that are deemed essential. Many deal with online delivery or food, and since consumers need both right now, there’s a high demand for workers who can fill part-time positions.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Here are just some companies you can work for until everything gets back to normal:
<ul>
 	<li>DoorDash</li>
 	<li>Uber Eats</li>

 	<li>Amazon</li>

It can be tough to work a regular job when you’re a single parent and have kids to care for. The costs of childcare are so high that going to work may not make financial sense.

If you’re forced to stay at home, your options may be limited when it comes to income. Luckily, there are several ways to earn money online.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Filling out surveys may not be the most lucrative online gig, but they can help you win gift cards and cash if you’re stuck at home. To keep your survey experience scam-free, we’ve come up with a list of four trustworthy sites you can sign up to today:
<h4>1. Survey Junkie</h4>
Do you love giving your opinion? When you sign up with Survey Junkie, you can turn your opinion into cash and gift cards. As a bonus, your idea will be used by brands so that they can do a better job of delivering services and products to the public.

While most jobs can be tedious, you can think of Survey Junkie as a side gig that helps you influence big brands while bringing in extra cash and gift cards for you and your kids.

Complete enough surveys, and you could get gift cards from retailers like Target or Amazon. Will they make you rich? No, but those gift cards (and PayPal cashouts) can come in handy on birthdays, when you need to buy school supplies, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. MyPoints</h4>
What stops most people from signing up for survey sites? The fear of scams.

With MyPoints, fear not, as the 20-plus-year-old survey site has an excellent rating with the Better Business Bureau. In other words, sign up to bring in some extra perks for your family, and you won’t have to worry about your info being stolen.

Gift cards are the name of the game with MyPoints, and you can earn them to shop at such places as Old Navy, Amazon, and Starbucks, among others.

Perhaps the best part about MyPoints is the variety in which it lets you earn points. In fact, you could even allow your kids to participate since the site enables you to watch videos, play games, and more in your quest for online goodies.

<h4>3. CashKarma</h4>
Cashkarma is another survey site that can bring your kids in on the online money-earning fun. And even when you don’t qualify for surveys, CashKarma will still give you rewards that can stack up over time.

As you watch movies, complete surveys, and more, CashKarma will give you rewards that can be converted into gift cards from Amazon.com. Or, as its name suggests, you can turn your rewards into PayPal cash.
<h4>4. InboxDollars</h4>
If you’re still skeptical of online survey sites, give InboxDollars a try. Its excellent rating with the BBB should keep you feeling safe, and the site’s fun factor should keep you and your kids entertained.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Out of all of the sites listed, InboxDollars may be the most diverse. Use it to read emails, watch videos, shop online to redeem rewards, or play games.

The Internet has made it much simpler to make money when you’re in a pinch. No longer do you need to personally know someone to get side work, as you can simply visit sites where strangers will pay you to complete tasks.

Can you make a full-time living doing online gigs? Look hard enough, and you could. But for this article, we’ll just assume you need cash fast, and here’s where you can find it:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Craigslist</h4>
Despite its bad reputation, you can find gigs galore on Craigslist. Remember the mantra that “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” and you should be good to go.

Craigslist gigs cover every skill under the sun, so if you don’t have a specialty, don’t fret. Here are the main categories of gigs you can apply for:
<ul>
 	<li>Computer</li>
 	<li>Creative</li>
 	<li>Crew</li>
 	<li>Domestic</li>
 	<li>Event</li>
 	<li>Labor</li>
 	<li>Talent</li>
 	<li>Writing</li>
</ul>
If you’re truly strapped for cash, you may want to visit Craigslist several times per day to be first in line for gigs as they come in. Depending on where you live, you may not have much time to contact a client before a gig goes dead.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Competition can be fierce, as you’re not the only one seeking quick Craigslist cash.
<h4>EasyShift</h4>
This app provides gigs that are more on the fun side, especially if you like shopping. There’s no experience necessary, either. Just download the EasyShift app, and get started.

What type of gigs can you find on EasyShift? Things like going into local stores to check prices on certain products. Or you may be asked to take photos of products or promotions.

While EasyShift gigs are easy, its most significant benefit may be the app’s fast payment. You can get paid via PayPal in as little as 48 hours, which is a lot better than your typical job that pays every two weeks.

<h4>Gigwalk</h4>
If you have kids that keep you from having a regular job due to the high cost of childcare, Gigwalk makes it simple to create your own schedule.

Once you sign up on the app, you can find local gigs that can pay anywhere from $3 to over $100. And since they vary in length between five minutes to a few hours, you truly have the power to customize a money-making schedule around your needs.

All you need to start making money is your smartphone and yourself. Once you’re finished with each gig, payment is made via PayPal.
<h4>TaskRabbit</h4>
This gig site comes last in the list for the simple fact that you must pay $25 to register. While that investment may make you wary, there’s a flip side: You could make more money via the app since it’s more selective.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

The list of available tasks on TaskRabbit are endless and include:
<ul>
 	<li>Waiting in line</li>
 	<li>Yardwork</li>
 	<li>Closet organization</li>
 	<li>Delivery service</li>
 	<li>Cleaning</li>
 	<li>Hanging pictures</li>
 	<li>Packing for a move</li>
 	<li>Data entry</li>
 	<li>Shopping</li>
 	<li>Returning items</li>
 	<li>And more</li>
</ul>
With so many tasks available, you’re more likely to start stacking cash. So even if the 25 bucks bums you out, give TaskRabbit a closer look.","Getting a second job can be too time-consuming when all you need is some extra income.

The explosion of the Internet has made it extremely simple to order things from the comfort of your couch. And this has created a demand for drivers to deliver it all.

While pizza may have paved the way in the delivery scene, you can now take everything under the sun to its rightful owner and get paid for it.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Which places offer the best perks when it comes to delivery? We’ll list several of them now so you can sign up and start stacking cash soon.

Some of the Best Delivery Services to Work For
<h4>Postmates</h4>
As with most of the services in this list, the biggest benefit of working with Postmates is that you get to set your schedule. This makes it ideal for:
<ul>
 	<li>College students who can’t sacrifice study time.</li>
 	<li>Single parents seeking side income when the kids are at school.</li>
 	<li>Anyone needing extra income, but without the time for a steady second job.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

What will you be doing as you deliver for Postmates? Taking groceries, food, retail items, and more to people who buy them.

You can get instant deposits and cash out when you want. Plus, you get to keep 100 percent of any tips you make.
<h4>Amazon Flex</h4>
Depending on where you live, you could make between $18 and $25 per hour delivering for Amazon Flex.

You can pick blocks of time when you want to work or schedule ahead for added structure. And since Amazon is so huge when it comes to online purchases, you’re bound to have plenty of work so you can save or have extra cash to pay the bills.
<h4>Uber Eats</h4>
Driving rowdy strangers around in your car as an Uber driver may not be appealing, but delivering food may not seem so bad. Work with Uber Eats, and you can do just that.

If you don’t have a ton of time to dedicate towards delivery, Uber Eats will let you work for as little as one hour per week.

Do you need a car to be eligible? No, because depending on where you live, you could deliver using your bike, scooter, or even on foot.

<h4>Roadie</h4>
Out of all of the apps on this list, Roadie stands alone in terms of its uniqueness. This clever app helps people receive items by using delivery drivers who are already headed that way.

Deliver for Roadie, and you could earn up to $60 for local deliveries. Do longer hauls, and that number can jump up to $650, which could put a nice dent in your monthly rent.
<h4>Shipt</h4>
Do you love shopping? Do it with other people’s money via Shipt, and you can earn up to $22 per hour to buy your own stuff later on.

Whether it’s full-time or part-time work as a Shipt shopper, you’ll get paid every week.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

To be eligible, here’s what you’ll need:
<ul>

<h4>Move Around More</h4>
With all the gyms closing, working out can be harder to accomplish. You can overcome this obstacle, though, by going to YouTube, where you’ll find plenty of free workouts you can do at home, even if you lack equipment. Many gyms have also come up with their own online classes to keep you in shape during coronavirus quarantine.

Even if you’ve never worked out before, now’s a good time to start moving around more to combat the stress and boredom that comes with having to stay inside.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Taking a walk around your neighborhood and getting some much-needed vitamin D from the sunlight can help you feel better. And if you kick things up a notch with a homemade workout, you can trigger the production of endorphins that can temporarily make you forget that COVID-19 even exists.
<h4>Tackle Tasks on Your To-Do List</h4>
One of your biggest enemies during a coronavirus quarantine is boredom. You can avoid it by doing tasks that you’ve meant to finish for a while, but never got around to due to your busy schedule.

For instance, you can go through your closet and gather up clothes you don’t use to sell online for extra cash. You can clean up your garage and pick out items to sell at a garage sale to supplement your lost income. And so on.

Have a look around your home. Does it seem very cluttered? By organizing it and getting rid of things you don’t need, you can feel calmer and gain the mental clarity that comes with a decluttered house.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Sleep More</h4>
Did you always feel tired before COVID-19 came onto the scene? Use this time to catch up on your sleep and establish better sleeping patterns.

Getting less than the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep per night can lead to fatigue and stress when you’re awake. It can also affect your hunger hormones and cause you to crave unhealthy foods that pack on the pounds and sap your monthly budget.

If you’re having trouble falling asleep, do things that can lead to more calm during the day, such as exercising and writing down your thoughts and feelings in a journal.
<h4>Stay Connected to Others</h4>
Social distancing urges us to stay at least six feet apart from others to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. This has led many of us to go into isolation in our homes.

While self-isolating is a good deed for the rest of the community as we try to tame COVID-19’s reach, it can lead to depression and loneliness.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

You can combat this by keeping in touch with others via technology. Even though in-person visits may be on hold, you can still talk to your loved ones via video chat for free through Facebook, Skype, and other avenues.

If you think loneliness is no big deal, think again. Studies have shown that it can lead to health issues that are linked to a higher coronavirus risk, such as inflammation of internal organs and suppressed immunity.","COVID-19 has created an environment of fear and uncertainty all over the world.

Even though schools may be closed due to COVID-19, there are several ways to keep kids’ minds sharp and their imaginations entertained without having to pay a thing.

The announcement of school closings came as a shock to parents all across the country. Not only did it put a stop to many parents’ work schedules due to the high cost of childcare, but it also put a stop to their kids’ education.

If so, you’ll be glad to know that the Section 202 program may be able to fill that need.
<h4>What Is the Section 202 Program?</h4>
Also called the Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, Section 202 provides rental assistance for seniors. It’s run by the HUD and is considered to be the organization’s best option for seniors seeking housing to fit their specific needs.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

While the fact that Section 202 has developed over 400,000 individual units for seniors since 1959 is impressive, it’s the features of these units that stand out.

Many seniors need special features in their homes to make life easier, and Section 202 has taken this into consideration with their construction plans. Some units are fully accessible for those who use wheelchairs, while others come equipped with ramps, grab rails, and more.
<h4>Why Is Section 202 Housing Best for Seniors?</h4>
As mentioned, the accessible features of Section 202 housing are ideal for the elderly. They go far beyond ramps and grab rails, however, as some units also offer perks like:
<ul>
 	<li>Communal spaces where seniors can eat, mingle, and hold events.</li>
 	<li>On-site care coordinators to assist residents.</li>
 	<li>Assistance with bathing, meals, and medications.</li>
 	<li>Transportation services.</li>
 	<li>Daily activities.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How Affordable Is Section 202 Housing?</h4>
Since a qualifying senior will only be expected to pay 30 percent of their income towards the rent, Section 202 housing is very affordable and an excellent option for someone on limited, fixed income.
<h4>Section 202 Eligibility Requirements</h4>
To qualify for Section 202 housing, there must be at least one or more seniors in the household. A senior is classified as someone 62 years of age or older. Also, the household income cannot be higher than 50 percent of the median income for the area.

You can see median income limits by going here. There are no asset limits set by the HUD.

Income can include such things as retirement funds, checking and savings accounts, and whole life insurance, however. To see how the HUD counts assets as income, go here.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How to Apply for Section 202 Housing</h4>
There are a couple of options for kickstarting the process to get senior rental assistance via Section 202. The first is to contact a Section 202 housing project directly by going in person. The second is to contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA) and ask them to point you in the right direction.

If the senior meets the income limits for the Supportive Housing for the Elderly program, they technically qualify for rental assistance. Unfortunately, many seniors require such housing assistance, which means demand exceeds supply.

In other words, the senior will probably have to sit on a waitlist. In some cases, these lists may have a wait time of two years or longer. For this reason, it's best to kickstart the process now by using one of those two options listed above.","Are you a senior in need of housing or rent assistance, or do you know somebody who does?","2021-06-26 23:50:08",post,https://spaoa.org/how-the-section-202-program-provides-seniors-with-housing-assistance/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1055845238.jpg,shutterstock_1055845238.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1055845238.jpg,2676,shutterstock_1055845238,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1055845238.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,how-the-section-202-program-provides-seniors-with-housing-assistance,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:54:03"

Everything from the immigration status and criminal history of everyone in the household, to the desired housing location is taken into consideration for the final decision.

There aren’t many trustworthy online resources in order to help with the application process. A slight oversight can derail the chances of success on your application. We’ll try to cover the main issues in this article.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Application Process</h4>
Unfortunately, there’s a large demand for government subsidized housing, especially now in the environment that we live in today. The first step involves enlisting yourself in a waiting list. There are a few things you’ll need for this:
<ul>
 	<li>A valid email address</li>
 	<li>A reliable mailing address</li>
 	<li>Patience and flexibility</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Keep in mind that there’s no need to pay any money up-front to apply, be wary of third party services that promise an expedited application process for a stiff fee.

A doctor’s note proving a disability or health issue of one of the members in the household may help expedite the wait time as well. Make sure to set up alerts that will notify you as soon as a placement opens up on the list.
<h4>Helpful Advice</h4>
You don’t have to sit idle while on the waitlist. Many housing authority experts and attorneys recommend people to properly document all communication with the housing authority and archive any email correspondence as well.

Make sure to be prompt when responding to any notices from the housing authority as well either through the phone, email, or mail. Keep the authority updates on any changes incurring in the household including marriage, divorce, or adoption.

<h4>The Approval Process</h4>
Even after your application has been approved, it’s no time to let up and ease on the proceedings. If you have any questions or concerns regarding documentation be sure to bring it up with the housing authority. There are walk-in days which you can take advantage of for a face-to-face consultation.

Be punctual with any paperwork you need to turn in, this could cause serious delays otherwise. Be sure to attend the housing authority briefing which is a necessary step before receiving the housing voucher.

Once you ultimately receive the housing voucher, check with the housing authority beforehand on the limit of bedrooms and rent amount for the apartment in question. Keep in mind that the security deposit and the utility bills will have to be paid by the tenant.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>How Landlords Get Paid</h4>
A recent statistics shows that over 5 million Americans across the country rely on the Housing Assistance Voucher program to help pay for rising rent prices.

Depending on the total income of the household, the average household on section 8 vouchers ends up spending around 30-40% of their total income on rent. The remaining portion is paid directly to the landlord from the program’s funds.","There are a few factors that could negatively affect your section 8 application.","2020-05-28 19:11:09",post,https://spaoa.org/what-could-ruin-your-section-8-housing-voucher-application/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_657530335.jpg,shutterstock_657530335.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_657530335.jpg,2678,shutterstock_657530335,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_657530335.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,what-could-ruin-your-section-8-housing-voucher-application,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-05-18 14:10:56"
2679,"Tips For Getting Into Section 8’s Affordable Housing","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Well, look no further as we’ll offer some tips and info on how to begin your Section 8 journey today.
<h4>Section 8 Background</h4>
While many still refer to the government’s affordable housing program as Section 8, it’s more formally referred to as the Housing Choice Voucher program nowadays.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and it makes safe, affordable housing a reality for many low-income families.
<h4>The Main Benefit of Section 8 Vouchers</h4>
Besides food, the need for shelter is number one for most of us. Unfortunately, this need may not be met due to the high costs of rent. With a Housing Choice Voucher, however, rent becomes much more affordable as a portion of it is paid thanks to funding from the HUD.

A Section 8 tenant will usually pay 30 percent of their monthly income towards their housing costs, while the voucher will take care of the rest via direct payments to the landlord.

In providing such aid, Section 8 offers families and their children much-needed stability to obtain and maintain employment, remain in school, and develop relationships in their community.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Section 8 Eligibility</h4>
Even though the HUD provides the funding, your local Public Housing Agency determines voucher eligibility, the application process, and more. You can contact your local PHA by going here.

To give you a general idea of who qualifies, here are some standard requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>You must be a citizen of the U.S. or a non-citizen who has eligible immigration status.</li>
 	<li>You must meet the Section 8 definition of a family, which can be just one person and doesn’t necessarily include having children.</li>
 	<li>Your household must make less than half of the area median income (AMI).</li>
</ul>
Again, your PHA can offer more specifics of eligibility, so contact them as soon as possible to know for sure.

<h4>Applying for Section 8</h4>
Each PHA has its specific rules for applying for Housing Choice Vouchers. Some may have strict open application periods you will have to pay attention to in order to kickstart the process officially.

Since PHAs vary in terms of the areas they cover and demand, your mileage may vary when it comes to the opening of application periods. Your PHA will let you know any relevant deadlines.
<h4>The Section 8 Wait</h4>
Receiving a Housing Choice Voucher can make a huge difference in your monthly budget as it will pay a significant portion of your rent. And while that’s a life-changing positive, here’s the main negative point when it comes to Section 8: wait times.

If your Section 8 application is approved, you will be moved to a waiting list. Depending on the demand for affordable housing in your area, you may be on this waiting list for a year or longer.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

For this reason, the best advice for anyone interested in Section 8 housing is to contact your PHA now, get acquainted with the program, and apply as soon as possible.

The sooner you apply, the sooner you can make the waiting list. Once you have your voucher, you can find various forms of affordable housing.

Should they meet the HUD’s requirements, you can move into the safe and affordable housing your family needs to both survive and thrive.","You may have heard of Section 8 affordable housing and wanted to reap its money-saving rewards, but didn’t know where to start.","2021-06-27 04:50:58",post,https://spaoa.org/tips-for-getting-into-section-8s-affordable-housing/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1457837645.jpg,shutterstock_1457837645.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1457837645.jpg,2680,shutterstock_1457837645,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1457837645.jpg,Housing,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,tips-for-getting-into-section-8s-affordable-housing,,default,0,0,0,open,open,"2021-07-26 13:52:43"

<h4>Virtual Assistant</h4>
There are two main reasons why starting your online work journey as a virtual assistant is a smart move. First, doing remote work as a VA can lead to an actual career. And if you’re particularly good at it, a client could hire you on a full-time basis.

Second, virtual assistants offer a wide variety of services. This means that you can get plenty of experience in several skills to make yourself more marketable down the line.

As an aside, both Upwork and Fiverr are great places to get your feet wet with work-at-home jobs. You can offer services amongst a host of skills and quickly find clients willing to pay for your efforts.

<h4>Sales Rep</h4>
If you have a talent for talking on the phone or are great and convincing people, you could earn a pretty penny doing remote work as a sales rep.

Although sales is a position that isn't for everybody, you can get remote work in this arena without any experience.

Companies that often look for work-at-home sales reps include Salesforce, American Express, and Working Solutions.
<h4>Online Moderation</h4>
As long as you’re familiar with chat rooms, online forums, and social media, you could get a work-from-home gig as a moderator for a website. Some may give you the gig without any experience, so it’s an excellent place to start if you’re looking to dive deeper into online work later on.

ModSquad and The Social Element are two companies where you can begin looking for online moderation work.

Telecommuting is quite common, as a 2016 Gallup study found that 43 percent of employed people spent at least part of their schedule working from home. Now, especially after COVID-19 shutdowns, that number is probably even higher, and it could continue to grow in the future.

While remote work can come in handy during a pandemic where health and safety is a priority, it offers several benefits for you, the employee, no matter what’s going on in the world.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Working from home can give you a greater feeling of satisfaction with your job. It can lead to more flexibility with your schedule, which is especially important if you have kids. It can also create an improved work-life balance. And lastly, remote work can result in more money in your pocket due to reduced transportation costs.

How can you enjoy these benefits if you currently work in an office? By asking your boss to let you work from home, which is what these steps will help you do.
<h4>1. Do your research to produce a compelling argument.</h4>
Remember that you’re trying to convince your boss as to how transitioning to remote setup benefits them, not you. Keeping this in mind, you need to find data that shows the following benefits for your boss:
<ul>
 	<li>Increased employee productivity when working from home.</li>
 	<li>How much departments can save by moving to a remote work environment.</li>
 	<li>How remote work helps businesses.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

So that your employer can make this move with the least work involved, also research remote work policies that other companies have instituted. Find ones that you like and that fit your vision, and your boss may accept them and apply them to your situation.

For professionalism and to show you’re truly serious, it’s best to present this info in a PowerPoint presentation or something similar that’s easy to digest.
<h4>2. Prove your worth.</h4>
The first step shows your boss the benefits of remote work. This second step should show them why you deserve such a setup.

Have you always showed up on time? Do you barely take sick days? Is your performance better than your peers? Any positives in your favor should be showcased to show your value and trustworthiness as an employee.

The more valuable you appear to be and the more your boss can trust you, the better your chance of getting to work from home.

<h4>3. Explain your desire to work from home.</h4>
Now comes the sales pitch of your presentation. You have to come up with convincing reasons as to why you want to work from home instead of at the office.

Explain how you’ll be more productive. Describe how you’ll have more energy and focus on work once a long commute isn’t involved. Whatever the reasons, stress how they’ll add to the company’s bottom line and make your employer’s job easier.
<h4>4. Make a sample schedule.</h4>
Will you only be available at certain hours? Will specific slots be set aside for calls and video chat? What will a typical day look like at your home office?

The more you can help your boss visualize the move, the more likely they’ll see it as a smooth transition and a solid decision.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Ask for a trial run.</h4>
You can’t expect your employer to simply say yes to such a significant change without trying it out first. Ask if you can do a three-month trial run to see how the new setup works out for both parties.

Who knows? You may prefer being in the office once that trial run is over.","Many workplaces have shifted to a remote setup.

2685,"Where To Find Free Or Low-Cost Dental Care","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Even though you use them every day to survive as you eat and drink, you may neglect your teeth. What can this lead to? Problems that are quite expensive to fix. And depending on their severity, problems that you cannot afford to ignore.

While preventative maintenance like brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash can keep you out of the dentist’s chair, it helps to know where to find free or low-cost dental care.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Here’s a list you should start exploring before it’s too late:
<h3>Sources of Free or Low-Cost Dental Care</h3>
<h4>Dental Schools</h4>
The American Dental Association has schools that help dentists perfect their craft. To get the best experience, these soon-to-be professionals can work on patients like yourself.

Such a setup offers a benefit to both sides. The dental trainees get real-world experience before starting their own practice. The patients, meanwhile, get dental care at a reduced cost.

Since licensed dentists oversee the entire process, there’s no need to feel nervous about using a dental school for affordable work.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

The American Dental Hygienist’s Association also has schools where you can get preventative care at a low cost. This is an option worth exploring if you want to get your teeth cleaned regularly without breaking the bank.
<h4>The Federal Government</h4>
There are three main programs funded by the federal government that can give you free or low-cost dental care, provided you are eligible.

If you have children under the age of 19 who do not have medical insurance, look towards the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for help. Depending on where you live, your child could qualify for dental coverage.

If you are 65 or older or disabled, Medicare could give you limited dental coverage. Although it won’t cover things like dentures or even routine dental care, every bit of help can make a difference.

Last but not least, Medicaid could give your family dental coverage in some cases.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>State and Local Health Departments</h4>
If help from the federal government is out of the question, grab your phone book and look up your local or state health department. Some offer financial assistance that includes dental coverage.

You may be able to find your nearest department by going <a href=""https://healthfinder.gov/findservices/searchcontext.aspx?show=1&amp;topic=820"">here</a> as well.
<h4>Charities</h4>
Some charities like the United Way can offer a helping hand to get your family the dental care they require. Religious organizations and other nonprofits may also do the same.

If you don’t know how to contact charities in your area, call 2-1-1 and speak to a local operator. Tell them you’re seeking free or low-cost dental care. They may be able to point you in the right direction.
<h4>Clinical Trials</h4>
Although it may sound a bit intimidating, participating in a clinical trial could get you the free dental work you need.

To find clinical trials near you, visit the <a href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"">U.S. National Library of Medicine’s site</a>, and do a search.","Finding free or low-cost dental care is a must if you’re on a tight budget.

2687,"Is It Hard To Get Food Assistance Through WIC?","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Finding work to replace lost income due to COVID-19 looks to be more complicated than ever. With more shutdowns on the way and additional waves of the outbreak, many are wondering how they will be able to feed their families once their bank accounts run dry.

One form of food assistance can come via SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Another can come via WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

While SNAP (aka food stamps) seems a bit more widespread in its use, WIC is on the more selective side. Does this mean it’s harder to qualify for? Not necessarily, if you fall into certain categories for eligibility, which we’ll discuss now.
<h3>WIC’s Eligibility Requirements</h3>
WIC breaks its eligibility into four sections. To qualify for WIC food benefits, you’ll have to meet all four.

Before you think there’s no way you’ll be eligible with such stringent requirements, you’ll see that they aren’t that bad. Even better, you can find out if you qualify so you can begin applying by using this <a href=""https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WIC Prescreening tool</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h4>1. Categorical</h4>
You can guess which groups of people qualify for WIC just by looking at its name containing women, infants, and children.

For a woman to qualify for WIC, one of the following must apply:

She must be pregnant – To receive benefits during the pregnancy and six weeks after it ends or the baby is born.
She must be in the postpartum stage – To receive benefits up to six months after the pregnancy is over or the baby is born.
She must be breastfeeding – To receive benefits until the infant is one year old.

An infant is eligible for WIC until they are one year old, as are children until they reach five years old.

<h4>2. Residential</h4>
WIC’s residential requirement is rather straightforward. You don’t have to live in the state or area you are applying in for a certain period to become eligible. You just have to live in the state you are applying to so you can receive benefits there.

In the case that you live where an Indian Tribal Organization is in charge of administering WIC, their own residency requirements will have to be met.
<h4>3. Nutrition Risk</h4>
WIC breaks down nutrition risks into two main categories:

Medical-based (underweight, anemia)
Dietary-based (poor diet)

To qualify, you will have to suffer from at least one. To meet this requirement, WIC offers no-cost nutrition screenings, or you can use information from your physician. A screening typically involves a blood test for anemia, plus height and weight measurements.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>4. Income</h4>
Last but not least, is WIC’s income requirement which can be met in one of two ways:

An income standard set by your state (often between 100 to 185 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines).
Automatic eligibility (by receiving or being eligible for other assistance programs like SNAP, TANF, or Medicaid).

You can view a chart of the income eligibility guidelines <a href=""https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/WPM-2020-4-WIC_IEG_2020-2021-Memo_corrected_508.pdf"">here</a>.","COVID-19 may have left you scrambling to pay your bills.

2924,"Medicare Open Enrollment: 2 Ways To Get Free Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If so, see how you can get free help during this period to get the healthcare coverage you deserve.
<h4>The Importance of Medicare Open Enrollment</h4>
What was the central theme of 2020? Besides the election, the obvious answer is the COVID-19 pandemic. What did it teach many of us? That our health should be our top priority, which is why not letting Medicare Open Enrollment go to waste is essential.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The OEP was put into place to help you and other Medicare users make the most out of your coverage. Since your healthcare needs may have changed over the year, and you may now require new prescriptions or providers, switching your plan may be a must. And since many plans can change as well, you’ll need to double-check to make sure you have the coverage you need once 2021 kicks into gear.
<h4>How Open Enrollment Works</h4>
Although it may sound or seem very complicated, the basics of Medicare Open Enrollment are relatively simple.

First, you review the coverage you have right now. Second, you explore other coverage options. Third, you make any necessary changes. And lastly, you notify your providers of those new plans, so everything goes smoothly next year.

As for how you can begin the process with free assistance, we’ll reveal that in a minute. But if you’d like to try on your own, start by looking at your Annual Notice of Change (ANOC) you received in the mail. It gives you insight on any changes you can expect in 2021 in terms of drug coverage, costs of prescriptions and services, out-of-pocket costs, in-network providers and pharmacies, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

If a review of your ANOC looks good and you’re satisfied with any changes set for 2021, you don’t have to make any adjustments. But if you find that additional costs or network changes do not suit your needs, you’ll want to shop around for better coverage.

What can shopping around and changing some of your plans do? Studies show that, on average, switching Medicare Part D coverage may save $300 per year. You can also improve your plan's quality by moving from, let’s say, a 3-star plan to one of the 5-star variety. Changing prescription coverage can also help you reduce out-of-pocket costs while ensuring you get the drugs you need. Those are just some examples, but you get the gist of it.

2927,"See How You Can Get Cheaper Rent Through Public Housing","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

We’ll give you the goods on how such assistance operates so you can take advantage of it soon.

What percentage of your monthly income goes towards paying the rent? If you’re like many, the simple answer is “too much.”

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

It certainly seems as if rent keeps going up while income stays the same, but unless you get another job or start doing side gigs, you’ll need to find other ways to reduce this necessary expense. What’s one of the best ways that may be overlooked? Assistance from the government, or specifically, public housing.

If you’ve heard of it before, you may think that public housing involves living in some massive, rundown government building that looks like something out of a post-apocalyptic world.

Luckily, that’s not the case, as public housing is safe and suitable for raising a family. Best of all, it’s very affordable, which is why you should apply if you’re looking to cut your rent costs.

Before you apply, let’s take a closer look at the basics of public housing, so you know what you’re in for.
<h4>Public Housing Background</h4>
The HUD or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is in charge of public housing. Unlike other living situations where you have a landlord who owns the private property, the government will be in charge here as housing is state-owned. Who will you deal with to get housing and maintain it while you’re a tenant? The local Public Housing Agency or PHA.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

If those three letters seem familiar, it’s because the PHA also administers the popular Section 8 program. And while Section 8 and public housing fall under the HUD and even have similar eligibility requirements, here’s where they differ most: How you pick your housing.

With Section 8, you pick where you’re going to live. Once you get approved for a housing voucher, the PHA pays the landlord each month, and you pay the remainder. You don’t pick where you live with public housing, as the PHA will do that for you.

Does this mean you’re limited to living in a specific type of property? No, because as with Section 8, public housing offers these options for those who qualify: Apartment, townhome, or single-family home.
<h4>Eligibility for Public Housing</h4>
When you apply for public housing through your PHA, which you can find here, they’ll use various factors to determine your eligibility.

To start, you’ll need to qualify as a low-income family, senior citizen, or someone with a disability. You’ll need to have proper citizenship too. Most importantly, you’ll need to qualify based on income. In other words, you won’t be able to make more than a certain amount and qualify for public housing, as it’s meant to help those with a financial need.
<h4>Applying for Public Housing</h4>
If you feel like you need public housing due to low income or other factors, you can begin the application process by contacting your PHA. They will require certain information and documents to process your application, and they will also interview you to determine if you are a suitable tenant.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Receiving Public Housing</h4>
If you qualify for public housing, your next step will be to sit on a waiting list until your spot comes up. The wait for public housing is usually long, but it could be accelerated if you live where demand is low or you have special circumstances like currently living in substandard housing.","If you want cheaper rent, the government may be able to help through its public housing program.

In the past, many jobs and gigs offered on the Internet were seen as scams, but that’s no longer the case. In fact, you could argue that the Internet is the best place to find money-making opportunities since it can connect you to others almost instantly without having to get off of your couch.

If you’re currently out of work and looking for some income, or you have a job that’s barely paying your bills, odd jobs or gigs found on the Internet could save the day. Before you start looking for them on your own, we’ll give you a glimpse as to what’s out there and how much money you could make.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
 
<h4>Where To Find Online Gigs and Odd Jobs</h4>
You can find online gags quite quickly using your favorite Internet search engine. For this article, however, we’ll take a look at one of the most popular ones that goes by the name of TaskRabbit.

A quick look at TaskRabbit can open your eyes to some of the ways to make money by completing odd jobs. Here are just some of the categories at your disposal:
<ul>
 	<li>Research</li>
 	<li>Senior care</li>
 	<li>Sewing</li>
 	<li>Shopping</li>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Could you complete tasks in some of those categories listed above? You probably could, and you probably have experience in multiple categories, which makes you qualified to start earning extra income soon.
<h4>How Much You Can Make With Side Gigs</h4>
You’re probably wondering if most of the tasks you’ll find online pay a minimum wage, and you’ll be glad to know that usually, the answer is no. How much do they pay? Surprisingly, the rates are quite high, although your mileage may vary depending on where you live.

To give you some examples, let’s look at the typical rates in the South Florida area. If you become a personal shopper and pick up groceries or other items for someone, you could get paid up to $21 per hour for your time. That may be much higher than what you make at your regular job, which is great news if you badly need an income boost.

If you help someone pack or unpack, that pays an average of $19 per hour, as does data entry if you’d like to avoid in-person contact during these uncertain times. Want to wash the occasional car? That brings an average of $15 per hour while running errands bumps up the pay to $21 per hour.

These average rates are for tasks that don’t involve much experience. If you have expertise in an area, you can look forward to even higher earnings. Plumbing help, for example, can earn an average of $39 per hour.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

What’s the best part about all of this? That these examples come from just one website, and there are many more like it.

2937,"How To Make Shopping For Children’s Clothes More Affordable","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Your monthly expenses exceed your income. What do you do? Look at your budget to see if there’s room for any cuts.

While you can easily cut costs associated with eating out and entertainment, here’s something you cannot cut if you have kids: Their clothes.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What makes it even worse? The fact that kids can grow so fast, they may barely wear those expensive clothes you buy them before they no longer fit.

Yes, kids’ clothes can be expensive, and keeping up with buying new ones constantly can be frustrating. There are ways to make kids’ clothes shopping more affordable, though, so let’s look at how you can cut those costs with a few simple moves:
<h4>Buy Used Kids’ Clothes</h4>
Do kids want to show up to school in used clothes? Probably not. But if that’s all you can afford with your budget, they’ll have to accept that used clothes are better than no clothes at all.

The obvious advantage of buying used clothes is that you can get them at a deep discount. Where can you find such clothes? If you’re taking the in-person route, local thrift stores are a good place to start. Many often have used clothes in good condition at affordable prices.

Beyond thrift stores, you can also look for local garage sales in your community. They can offer even bigger discounts than thrift stores, although the selection may be smaller.

The Internet is a great place to find used kids’ clothes as well. In fact, you’ll probably have a much easier time what you’re looking for there, as sites like Thredup, Kidizen, Poshmark, etc., are usually loaded with children’s attire.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

When shopping for used clothes online, try to buy from online sellers with solid ratings. Also, make sure the listings have several pictures so you can ensure the clothes are in good condition before you buy.
<h4>Use Discount Retailers To Find the Best Prices</h4>
What’s one of the worst places to take your kids? The mall. Why? Because it usually has designer clothes that are quite expensive, and your kids will likely want those high-priced threads to be the talk of their classmates.

Instead of buying expensive brand names for your kids, opt for cheaper clothes at discount retailers like:
<ul>
 	<li>Target</li>
 	<li>Walmart</li>
 	<li>T.J. Maxx</li>
 	<li>Ross</li>
 	<li>Marshalls</li>
 	<li>Big Lots</li>
</ul>
When shopping in these stores, remember these three money-saving tips:
<ol>
 	<li>Look for the clearance rack, which is usually in the back of the store.</li>
 	<li>Buy pieces you can mix and match, instead of expensive outfits.</li>
 	<li>Look for sales on out of season clothes, but remember to buy a bigger size if your children are still growing.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Get Kids’ Clothes for Free</h4>
You may want to exhaust this option before buying any clothes if your budget is very tight. Where can you find free clothes for children? The Facebook Marketplace and the Craigslist free section are great places to start.

Some people want to clean out their homes without worrying about selling their used clothes. They can achieve that goal through those two popular websites.","There’s no need to break the bank when shopping for clothes your kids will soon outgrow.

Have you found it impossible to pay the rent on time every much because it takes up the majority of your income? If so, a Section 8 housing voucher could fix that problem by only making you pay a small percentage of your income towards the rent.

Does a Section 8 voucher let you live wherever you want? Does it let you pick apartments that are usually out of your price range? We’ll answer those questions, and more so you can get a better understanding of how Section 8 works.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Where can you use a Section 8 voucher?</h4>
Whether you want to stick where you are or move across the country, here’s some good news: You can use a Section 8 voucher wherever there’s a Public Housing Authority (PHA) to administer it. In short, your voucher is portable.
<h4>Do you have to live in public housing with your voucher?</h4>
No, as public housing is a bit different from Section 8. In public housing, you live on a property that’s owned by the state. With Section 8, you can pick a participating property, such as a single-family home, apartment, or townhome, that’s owned by a landlord.

This flexibility of getting to pick between different living options is one of the reasons why Section 8 is so popular compared to other housing assistance programs.
<h4>Can you pick any property you want?</h4>
Whether it’s a single-family home, apartment, or townhome, the property you pick will have to meet Section 8 standards. To ensure that it meets this requirement, the property will be inspected. It will also have to accept Section 8 vouchers if you want to live there.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>What is a voucher worth?</h4>
A voucher’s value depends on your income. On average, you’ll be paying 30 percent of your adjusted monthly income towards the rent. The voucher will take care of the rest, but the property has to be in line with the Fair Market Rent for the area. In other words, don’t expect the voucher to pay for a luxury apartment.

If you choose a more expensive apartment, you will have to pay any of the excess beyond the Fair Market Rent out of your own pocket.
<h4>Can a voucher be used towards a mortgage?</h4>
If you would like to own a home versus renting it, you may be able to use your voucher to help pay the mortgage. To qualify for this program, you will need to be a first-time homebuyer. Unless you are elderly or disabled, you will have to be employed continuously for one year. You will also need a minimum household income of $10,300.
<h4>How can you get a housing voucher?</h4>
You will need to apply through your local PHA. Remember that you will have to meet certain income requirements, such as making less than 50 percent of the area median income, to qualify for Section 8.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

You can begin the application process or learn more about Section 8 by finding your PHA <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.","A Section 8 housing voucher can simplify the rent-paying process.

What happens if you don’t pay your rent on time? At first, you get complaints from your landlord. But if it happens too many times or excessive time passes before you pay, you could get evicted and find yourself living on the streets.

What are your options if you have issues paying your rent? You could look for a higher-paying job, work a second job, or start doing some side gigs for extra cash. You could also turn to friends and family to see if you can stay with them until you get your finances in order.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Those are options many people tend to turn to, but they often forget this one: Getting help from the government. Let’s discuss one way Uncle Sam can help you in this regard via the public housing program.
<h4>An Intro to Public Housing</h4>
The name “public housing” almost makes it seem like a punishment - as if you’d be living in some downtrodden place because you have no other options. And while some may have that opinion of public housing without knowing any better, here’s the truth: Public housing can save you money while putting you into a safe single-family home, apartment, or townhome.

Those three types of properties offered under the public housing umbrella are all owned by the state. In other words, the government will be your landlord should you be accepted into the program. As such, you will not only apply through a local Public Housing Agency (PHA), but you will also have to pass their interview so they can see that you’re a solid fit as a tenant.

What’s the main benefit of public housing? The fact that it can greatly reduce the amount of rent you have to pay each month. But before you can enjoy this benefit, you’ll have to apply and show that you’re eligible for the program.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>How To Become Eligible for Public Housing</h4>
As you may expect, public housing was instituted to help those in need. It serves many low-income families, as well as people with disabilities and senior citizens.

As part of the screening process, the PHA will look at your citizenship, whether you’re a low-income family, senior, or have a disability, and if your income does not exceed the program’s limits. Depending on where you live and the PHA’s requirements, you may also have some other factors that will be considered.

How can you find that your income makes the cut and that you meet other public housing requirements? You guessed it, by contacting your PHA and telling them you’d like to apply.

Your PHA will have all the info you need to start the application process. They will tell you which documents are necessary for verification and what’s necessary to get the ball rolling.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Since waiting lists for public housing tend to be long, your best bet is to contact your PHA now without delay. The sooner you do, the quicker you’ll have those keys to your new, affordable home.","Your monthly rent worries could be solved within the next five minutes? How?

COVID-19 not only brought concerns for our health, but it also resulted in the closing of many businesses deemed not essential. Once they shut their doors, massive job loss followed.

What happens when you lose your job? You lose income and have trouble paying the bills. And one bill many couldn’t keep up with was the rent or mortgage.

2958,"See Why You Should Start The Year By Calling Your Car Insurance Company","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

A great place to start is by calling your car insurance company to get a better rate.

What was your biggest takeaway from 2020? Besides the fact that you wish COVID-19 would disappear forever, it was probably this: You need to <a href=""https://spaoa.org/simple-ways-to-save-money-online/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">hold on to more of your cash</a>. Why? To build an emergency fund in case you lose your job, see a drop in your income, or some other unfortunate event happens.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Of course, holding onto your cash can be easier said than done. You’ll have to look at your monthly expenses and see where you can save. And while you could stop eating out and cut your Netflix and other entertainment subscriptions, this might be an even easier move: Reducing your car insurance payment.

It’s something we don’t think about too often. But a lower car insurance payment means more money in your pocket. And, if you do the following, it’s something that’s surprisingly easy to do.

How do you kickstart the process of paying less for insurance? By giving your agent a call.
<h4>What To Ask Your Car Insurance Agent</h4>
Since they signed you up in the first place, there’s no better place to start than with your agent. Grab a copy of your policy and give them a call.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

You can get right to the point and tell them you’re calling because you want to minimize your premium. They should have a list of recommendations that can trim your costs, such as:
<ol>
 	<li>Increasing your deductible – You’ll pay more out of pocket if an accident happens, but it can reduce your monthly payment.</li>
 	<li>Getting rid of what you don’t need – Your policy may be packed with bells and whistles you never use. Trim the fat by getting rid of things like rental car coverage and roadside assistance, and you could enjoy quick savings.</li>
 	<li>Reducing coverage – Depending on your car, some coverage could be dropped without leaving you exposed. Collision and comprehensive coverage, for example, aren’t always needed with older cars that are paid off and have little value.</li>
</ol>
After your agent lists moves you can make to minimize your payment, ask them about discounts. You could qualify for a discount due to military service or membership in a group or organization. You can also ask if you can do anything to your car to lower your payment.

For instance, you could install a security system to prevent theft. Many insurance companies offer discounts for such a feature.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Have your driving habits changed since the coronavirus hit the scene? If you started working from home, they probably have. By driving fewer miles, you could get a discount.

There are also usage-based policies that may appeal to your needs. They’ll require you to limit your mileage and may track when and where you drive. If that’s not a problem, you could significantly reduce what you pay for car insurance in 2021.","With all of the holidays and celebrations in the rearview, it’s time to think about how you’ll cut costs in 2021.

2964,"Looking Into Food Stamps? Read This First","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As you think of ways to keep your family fed, it may seem like every solution is just another obstacle. For instance, you could get a second job, but since you have kids to care for, hiring a babysitter could be more trouble than it’s worth. You could also cut back on food costs to save money, but that could mean that starvation enters the picture, which isn’t ideal for any family.

What’s another option besides working more or saving money? Getting food assistance from the government. And while there are several ways to do so, SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is the best of the bunch.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Let’s take a quick look at how this program works, so you can see if it would be a good fit for your nutritional needs.
<h4>Applying for SNAP</h4>
As with most government programs, you’ll need to apply for SNAP to receive benefits. During that application process, you will have to meet specific requirements to become eligible.

Since SNAP is meant to help feed low-income families, it comes as no surprise that your income and resources are looked at before receiving any food stamps.

Gross and net income are part of this eligibility equation. In other words, your local SNAP office will first look at what income you bring in from work, pensions, etc. You can then use deductions for childcare, utilities, and more to come up with a net income.

Meeting gross and net income requirements are just part of the puzzle. Your resources, including bank accounts, extra cars, etc. will also be looked at to make sure they don’t exceed a certain level. You can also not have felony drug convictions, be an undocumented immigrant, or a college student (in most cases) to be eligible for SNAP.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

All of these eligibility specifics can be found by contacting your local SNAP office, where you can also kickstart the application process.
<h4>Using SNAP Benefits</h4>
If you apply for SNAP and qualify for food stamps, you will most likely receive benefits loaded onto a card. This EBT card works just like a debit card, so any worries about whipping out actual food stamps like people used to do are erased.

Can SNAP benefits be used for everything under the sun? No, as they’re mostly meant for food and nutritional necessities.

You won’t be able to buy lotto tickets, liquor, or tobacco products with SNAP. However, you can fill up your fridge and pantry with essentials like meat, milk, eggs, bread, fruits, vegetables, snacks, and more.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Using SNAP is much easier than ever, as the program is now accepted in many stores. You can bank on your big grocery chains receiving food stamps. However, if you want to be sure where you can use your SNAP benefits so you there’s no trial and error involved, use <a href=""https://usda-fns.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e1f3028b217344d78b324193b10375e4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this handy SNAP Retailer Locator</a>.

2973,"Food Insecurity: Biden Makes Several Announcements To Fight It","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

See how President Biden is spending his first days fighting food insecurity so your family won’t have to worry about nutrition.

Think of all the worries that the COVID-19 has brought with it. First, you have to worry about social distancing. Second, you have to wear a mask (or two). Third, you need to wash your hands constantly. Fourth, you have to worry about shutdowns that could negatively impact your livelihood. And fifth, you have to think about how you’ll pay the bills regardless of your troubles, as well as keeping your family fed, so they don’t starve.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

If reading that triggered anxiety and not-so-good feelings, don’t fret, as you’re certainly not alone. And we recently got some good news on the food front, as President Biden made several significant moves to make it easier to feed your family, regardless of your financial troubles.

Whether your fridge is empty due to the pandemic or other issues, here are ways that President Biden is aiming to make food insecurity a thing of the past:
<h4>More Accessibility and More Money for Food Stamps</h4>
Food stamps or SNAP is a benefit that keeps many families afloat. It does so by giving them funds every month that they can use at the grocery store to buy necessary foods, such as meat, milk, eggs, and so on. There are two issues with food stamps, though: 1. Not everyone can get them. 2. Sometimes, they’re not enough.

To address these two issues, President Biden signed an order to increase food stamp funding by 15 percent, giving states more power to feed their citizens during these tough times.
Also, he announced that the Thrifty Food Plan, which regulates SNAP eligibility, should be revamped. By changing the outdated plan, Biden and others in the White House believe that food stamps will correctly address the need for nutrition in America while making benefits more accessible to those who need them.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

As if the news of a 15 percent increase in food stamp benefits and better accessibility wasn’t enough, Biden also said he’d like to extend that increase into the future.
<h4>Increased WIC Funding</h4>
While SNAP may be the most well-known food assistance program around, WIC, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, is also widely used.
Biden announced he would like a $3 billion increase in WIC funding to help mothers and their babies get the nutrition they need.
<h4>Higher Pandemic-EBT Benefits</h4>
As schools closed due to COVID-19, many low-income students saw their nutrition suffer. The Pandemic-EBT program gave these students funds to replace lost free or reduced-price meals, and Biden ordered a 15 percent increase for it.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Additional Food Assistance for U.S. Territories</h4>
Biden plans on boosting food assistance to these areas by $1 billion.
<h4>Restaurant Assistance</h4>
Restaurants have been devastated due to COVID-19. Biden said he’d like to get them more involved in the food supply chain so they can stay afloat and keep their workers employed.","Food assistance has always been a hot topic, but it’s even hotter now due to the coronavirus pandemic.

2978,"No Cash? 5 Ways To Pay Your Landlord With A Credit Card","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Your rent is late. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time it’s happened, so you’re landlord has just about had it. What are your options before you get that eviction letter and end up on the streets?

You could call up friends or family and ask for a loan, but that may be a bit embarrassing. You could get a personal loan, but that may end up being more of a hassle than it’s worth. You could sell some of your stuff, but that can take a while and leave you short-handed. Or you could whip out your credit card and use that to pay your landlord instead.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Yes, paying the rent with your credit card is a thing. And even though you may not want to do it every single month, using your card can come in handy when times are tough.

If you’ve never done it before, we’ll show you how to use your card to pay the rent, plus the benefits and risks that come with it.
<h3>Ways To Pay With Your Credit Card</h3>
Your landlord may be willing to take a credit card payment if you have no other means at the moment. Ask them first. If they say yes to the card, here are some potential options to process your payment if the landlord doesn’t have one set up already:
<h4>1. RentMoola</h4>
Transaction fees: 2.99% credit, $3.99 debit
Landlord receives a direct deposit.
<h4>2. RadPad</h4>
Transaction fees: 2.99% credit, $4.95 debit
Landlord receives a check.

<h4>4. Plastiq</h4>
Transaction fees: 2.5% credit, 1% debit
Landlord receives a check, wire transfer, or ACH transfer.
<h4>5. Venmo</h4>
Transaction fees: 3% credit, free debit
Landlord receives payment directly via Venmo.
<h3>The Good and Bad of Paying Rent With Credit</h3>
As you can see, there are various ways to process credit card payments, so your landlord gets paid. But how does making this move affect you? Here are the good and bad aspects of using credit for your rent payment:

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

 	<li>You can earn rewards points for travel discounts or convert them into cash or gift cards.</li>
 	<li>You can keep on track by setting up automatic payments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>You may have a processing error if you exceed your credit limit, the card is expired, etc. This can delay your payment.</li>
 	<li>Credit card payments may take a while to process, which could anger your landlord even more.</li>
 	<li>Interest can make your rent more expensive if you don’t pay your CC balance each month.</li>

2992,"8 Hacks To Cut Gas Consumption When Driving","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>1. Cruise and coast.</h4>
Giving your foot a rest can lead to significant fuel savings. Instead of constant acceleration and breaking that increases gas consumption and wear and tear on your car, learn to cruise and coast.

For long trips, use cruise control to maintain a steady speed and avoid speeding tickets that’ll hurt your wallet. As long as you’re not in a hilly area, the cruise control should give you better gas mileage than your foot can.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

As for coasting, it involves letting the car glide after you accelerate and anticipating turns and stops. Look ahead for red lights and take your foot off the gas to let the car glide before a stop. Do that instead of hard braking, and experts estimate you can get 40 percent better gas mileage.
<h4>2. Avoid putting the pedal to the medal.</h4>
Auto industry experts say that around half of your car’s energy is used when accelerating. If you floor it to take off every time you’re at a light or stop, you’ll waste a ton of gas that you paid a lot for at the pump.
<h4>3. Avoid low-gear driving.</h4>
If you want to waste a lot of gas, drive in a low gear. To avoid excess gas consumption, use low gears when approaching corners or driving on hills. Otherwise, try getting into top gear as soon as possible. In doing so, you’ll save gas and get better performance.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>4. Stick to the speed limit.</h4>
Here’s an eye-popping statistic for all of you speeders out there: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, every 5 miles per hour over 50 adds 18 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas. Instead of driving 65 miles per hour, drop it to 55, and you’ll get 15 percent better gas mileage.
<h4>5. Close your windows at high speeds.</h4>
Some people swear by opening their windows to keep cool versus using the A.C. While this can help improve gas mileage at low speeds, it won’t help you at high ones due to drag. The same holds true for opening your sunroof, so keep it closed when cruising on a high-speed highway.
<h4>6. Turn your car off when parked.</h4>
It can be relaxing to park in a secluded area and sit there with your car running. But it won’t be relaxing to your budget, as idling can waste as much as half a gallon of gas per hour.

If you idle a lot in your car, don’t feel bad, as you’re certainly not alone. The U.S. Department of Energy states that this driving habit wastes three billion gallons of gas per year.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>7. Lighten the load.</h4>
If you can, don’t use your car as a storage shed. The heavier it is, the more gas you’ll consume.
<h4>8. Keep those tires inflated.</h4>
Check your car’s manual to see what the correct tire pressure is. Then, aim to keep your tires inflated to that point to optimize fuel economy.

If your tires are overinflated, you can ruin their treads quicker, forcing you to buy new ones before you should. And if your tires are underinflated, you can increase gas consumption.","You may not have the power to impact the rising price of gas, but you can use the following hacks to improve your fuel economy and cut costs.

2998,"See What Can Stand In Your Way Of Section 8 Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Ask most people what would greatly help them balance their budget, and many would say paying less for rent. How can you pay less for rent? You could downgrade your apartment or home, get a roommate, work a second job, and so on. Or you could get housing assistance from the government via a voucher, which is likely the ideal option.

While you’ll need to be within certain income limits and have citizenship to qualify for Section 8, we’ll discuss other obstacles that can keep you from getting a voucher. Beyond that, we’ll also discuss how you can lose your voucher, which will increase your rent cost once again.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Obstacles That Can Prevent You From Getting a Housing Voucher</h4>
Being approved for a Section 8 voucher is just part of the process. Once approved, you’ll need to find a property where you can use your voucher. Unlike other housing assistance programs, this will be private property owned by a landlord. You’ll need to pass their requirements to move in.

What will a landlord look at when screening you as a potential tenant? Here are some factors that can be seen as red flags:
<ul>
 	<li>Not enough references from past landlords.</li>
 	<li>Lacking income to pay your portion of the rent, even though your voucher will help.</li>
 	<li>Poor credit history.</li>
 	<li>Felony convictions.</li>
 	<li>Prior evictions.</li>
</ul>
All of those are deemed reasonable standards landlords can use to approve or reject you as a tenant. If you believe a landlord rejected you for some other reason, you may be the victim of housing discrimination, which is illegal. If that’s the case, contact your Public Housing Agency (PHA) and let them know.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Even if the landlord approves you, something else will need approval: The property. Section 8 has standards for safety and affordability. The property will be inspected to ensure it’s safe and up to code, but it must also be affordable compared to similar real estate in the area. If the inspection fails or the property is too expensive, that could keep you from using your voucher.

Although Section 8 will pay a portion of your rent with a voucher, it won’t cover any application fees charged by a landlord. It also won’t cover a security deposit, so if you lack savings for those costs, you may have trouble moving into a Section 8 property.
<h4>Violations That Can Lead You To Lose Your Voucher</h4>
If you succeed in getting a voucher and moving into an approved property, you’ll need to obey rules from your landlord and Section 8 to maintain your housing assistance.
Violations that can cause you to forfeit your voucher include:
<ul>
 	<li>Not paying your portion of the rent.</li>
 	<li>Causing disturbances.</li>
 	<li>Damaging the unit.</li>
 	<li>Violent or drug-related criminal activity.</li>
 	<li>Not reporting changes in your household size in writing.</li>
 	<li>Hiding income earned by adults in the household.</li>
 	<li>Not abiding by the terms of the lease.</li>
 	<li>Eviction.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Your PHA can terminate your voucher for any of the above. If that happens, you’ll get an official letter of termination in the mail. You can respond by requesting an informal hearing regarding the decision, but it’s best not to commit the violations in the first place since Section 8 can be a major boost to your budget.","A Section 8 housing voucher can be hard to come by since the demand is so high.

A Section 8 voucher can pay a big portion of your rent, which can help you save cash versus spending it. To participate in this housing assistance program, you’ll have to follow some rules and procedures. If you don’t, you could lose your voucher and the affordable rent that comes with it.
<h4>The Frequency of Inspections</h4>
Inspections are one of the most important procedures in the Section 8 process. As a tenant, you’ll most likely deal with them on two occasions:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Before moving into a property you picked.</li>
 	<li>Each year while living in the property.</li>
</ul>
The first occasion requires an inspection so that the Public Housing Agency (PHA) can determine the property meets the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards. This is to ensure that the place is safe for you to live in.

The second occasion, which occurs annually, is used to ensure that the home is still safe, and that you’re properly maintaining it as part of the Section 8 agreement.

Can there be other inspections? Yes, as you or your landlord can request inspections if there’s a concern about a health or safety condition.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>What Inspectors Look For</h4>
As for what an inspector specifically looks for, they tend to focus on these performance requirements that make up the HUD’s Housing Quality Standards:
<ul>
 	<li>Access</li>
 	<li>Food preparation and refuse disposal</li>
 	<li>Illumination and electricity</li>
 	<li>Interior air quality</li>
 	<li>Lead-based paint</li>
 	<li>Sanitary conditions</li>
 	<li>Sanitary facilities</li>
 	<li>Site and neighborhood</li>
 	<li>Smoke detectors</li>
 	<li>Space and security</li>
 	<li>Structure and materials</li>
 	<li>Thermal environment</li>
 	<li>Water supply</li>
</ul>
The inspector will look for any hazards or health issues in those areas, and they will mark each as pass, fail, or inconclusive. Just one fail will equal a failed inspection, and you or the landlord will be allowed to fix the issue by a certain date. The inspector will come back on that date to see that the problem is fixed. If it isn’t, you could lose your Section 8 voucher. And if the problem is your landlord’s fault, you could be allowed to move.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Preparing for Inspection</h4>
While it’s the landlord’s responsibility to prepare for a Section 8 inspection before you move in, it’ll be up to you to do so during the annual check-up. Here are some things you can do ahead of time to increase your chances of passing the inspection so you can keep receiving assistance:
<ul>
 	<li>Have your landlord perform any repairs before the inspection.</li>
 	<li>Remove all garbage and junked appliances, furniture, and automobiles from the property.</li>
 	<li>Clean your walls to remove graffiti or grease.</li>
 	<li>Clean your floors.</li>
 	<li>Make sure your sinks, tubs, and toilets are clean.</li>
 	<li>Clean your kitchen appliances.</li>
 	<li>Have any broken light fixtures, bathroom fixtures, doors, etc. fixed.</li>
 	<li>Patch holes in your ceiling or roof.</li>
 	<li>Keep any pets away from the inspector.</li>
 	<li>Make sure your smoke alarms are working properly.</li>

In short, try to make your home as tidy as possible, both inside and out. While you can’t be expected to maintain a perfect home, showing that you’ve cared for it should be enough to give you a passing grade.","Inspections play a huge role in the Section 8 process for both the tenant and the landlord.

3004,"How To Get On A Section 8 Waitlist","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Do you consider yourself a patient person? If you’re applying for a Section 8 housing voucher, hopefully, the answer is yes. Why? Because contrary to popular belief, Section 8 isn’t emergency rental assistance that you can get right away. Instead, you may be waiting a year or longer to get your voucher, and such a wait requires a ton of patience.

Why is the wait for Section 8 so long? First, it’s worth noting that the wait will depend on your location, so your mileage may vary. But as for why it’s so long, you can blame it on the combination of limited funds and high demand.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The government simply doesn’t have enough in its budget to give vouchers to every single family that needs them. This limited supply combined with a massive demand means that even though you may get approved for Section 8, it could be a while before you get to reap its money-saving and stability-providing rewards.

Of course, before you can begin your wait, you’ll have to get on a list. And that’s what the following can help you do:
<h4>Contact your nearest Public Housing Agency (PHA).</h4>
Your PHA will be your primary contact throughout the Section 8 application process and beyond. You should contact the PHA located near where you plan on living, which may differ from your current location. To kickstart the Section 8 application process, go <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a> to find your nearest PHA.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Make sure you have an email account.</h4>
It may seem like a silly suggestion or reminder, but without an email account, you won’t be able to apply for Section 8. Create your via Gmail or another service for free, if needed.
<h4>Make sure you have a mailing address.</h4>
Beyond email, you’ll also need a dependable mailing address to receive correspondence from the PHA. If you’re always on the move, use a friend or family member’s address. Missing an important notice from the PHA could lengthen your wait time or make you lose your spot altogether.
<h4>Don’t pay to apply.</h4>
Applying for Section 8 is free. Don’t pay anyone to apply for your Housing Choice Voucher. And when you get on a waitlist, don’t pay to move up on it, as that’s a no-no and a telltale sign of a scam.
<h4>Apply to several waitlists.</h4>
Pick multiple locations where you could see yourself living. By applying to more than one waitlist, you may be able to get your voucher quicker. After one year of living in your first Section 8 rental, you can move and bring your voucher along for the ride.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Get housing alerts.</h4>
Waitlists tend to open and close due to demand. Ask your PHA if they have a notification or alert system that can tell you when a waitlist opens so you can apply quickly and get a good spot in line.
<h4>Ask your doctor for help.</h4>
If someone in your household has health issues or a disability, a note from your doctor could lead the PHA to reduce your wait time once you get on their list.","Getting on a Section 8 waitlist means you’re one step closer to more affordable rent.

3007,"You Made The Section 8 Waiting List. Now What?","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

When you hear the term “waitlist,” what do you think it means? If you’re like most, you probably think it signifies that you’re about to receive something, and all you have to do is wait to get it. When it comes to the Section 8 waitlist, however, you can’t be inactive. You’ll need to take action and keep pushing to get your voucher, which includes taking these steps:
<h4>1. Apply to more waitlists.</h4>
Sitting on just one Section 8 waitlist puts you at the mercy of one Public Housing Agency (PHA). And depending on the location and the supply/demand for vouchers, that PHA could leave you waiting a very long time.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

How can you overcome this? Apply to as many waitlists as possible. In doing so, you’ll open up the door to more opportunities, instead of putting all of your eggs in one basket.

What should you do if you finally get a voucher, but it’s not from your “ideal” waitlist? Take the voucher and live in that location. Once the year is up, you can transfer it somewhere else that suits you better.
<h4>2. Get in touch with other Section 8 applicants.</h4>
Navigating and understanding the Section 8 process may seem complicated and overwhelming. You can find help on the topic online via Facebook Groups and message boards. Share your thoughts and concerns with others, and you may learn some tips along the way to accelerate the time it takes to get your voucher. You may also gain peace of mind so you can reduce the stress that comes with the long Section 8 wait.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Keep in touch with your PHA.</h4>
It’s crucial to keep an open line of communication with your PHA. If you don’t, you could face delays, errors with your application, or lose your chance at a voucher altogether.

Your PHA will send you correspondence throughout the process. Check your mail, email, and phone regularly to ensure you can respond to any messages as quickly as possible.

Beyond checking for correspondence, you’ll need to be proactive in providing updates to your PHA. For instance, if you get married or divorced, have children, or someone moves out of your home, notify the PHA of your change in household composition. If you move, let them know. And if your household income increases or decreases, give them that update too. Any such changes can impact the value of your voucher.
<h4>4. Document everything.</h4>
Keep all correspondence in a file, so you don’t lose it. Take pictures of letters you receive. Save emails, and so on. Some PHAs experience high turnover, so you don’t want your voucher application getting lost in the mix. Errors are common, too. By keeping records, you can supply information as needed to avoid any delays with your voucher that weren’t due to your negligence.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>5. Be prepared to wait.</h4>
It’s not uncommon for a Section 8 voucher to take years to finally get into your hands. In fact, it’s estimated that only 25 percent of Section 8 applicants get the assistance they need due to this long wait.

Don’t depend solely on your voucher to fix your rent situation. Until it’s 100 percent processed, do your best to reduce expenses, save money, and pay your landlord on time. You could also move somewhere cheaper, get roommates to share the rent, or move in with friends and family until you get situated.","Getting placed on a Section 8 waiting list is an accomplishment.

3010,"The Easiest Way To Get A Section 8 Voucher Faster","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Life would be a lot easier if your rent were cheaper. Not only could you get your landlord off your back, but you could also start paying down debt, handling other bills, or stashing cash for a rainy day.

What can make your rent cheaper? Besides moving somewhere remote or getting a roommate, a Section 8 voucher can cut those rent costs so you can keep more money in your pocket.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Get a Section 8 voucher, and you’ll only be paying about 30 percent of your income to your landlord. But since a voucher makes rent so affordable, many people want to get one. And this high demand has led to long wait times that could last years.

Will your wait for a voucher last several years? That depends on several factors like voucher availability, where you want to live, and so on. You can reduce the delay by applying to several waiting lists, which increases your chances of getting a voucher quicker. You could also look for places where people may not want to live, as their voucher demand could be lower.

What’s another way to speed up the Section 8 process? Using preferences that give you priority over other voucher applicants.
<h4>How Preferences Reduce Section 8 Wait Times</h4>
The government created the Section 8 program to provide housing assistance to those who need it most. As such, Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) have come up with preferences to determine who has the greatest need.

The more preferences apply to your household, the better your chances of getting your voucher sooner. So, if any of the following apply, tell your PHA as quickly as possible. If you don’t, you could find yourself waiting a long time to get rental assistance:

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<ul>
 	<li>Homelessness (not living with friends or family)</li>
 	<li>Living in a shelter</li>
 	<li>Veteran (must be honorably discharged)</li>
 	<li>Elderly (age 62 or older)</li>
 	<li>In the extremely low-income bracket (earn 30 percent of your area’s median income)</li>
 	<li>Have a disability (especially if where you’re living is making the disability worse)</li>
</ul>
You’ll have to provide documentation to prove those preferences, but it’s well worth putting in the time to report them, as they can move you up the Section 8 waitlist a lot faster than you thought.
<h4>Checking Your Voucher Status</h4>
Once you’re on the Section 8 waitlist, there are a couple of ways to check the status of your voucher. The first is to use the Waitlistcheck website. It’s a safe and secure site from the HUD that lets you see how you’re progressing on the waitlist. The second way to check your status is to call the PHA every couple of months. Ask them if you’re still on the list and if you’ve moved up at all.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Be sure to document any calls with the PHA, especially concerning your voucher status. Errors are not uncommon, so having documentation could save you a lot of hassle if you find you’ve been kicked off the waitlist by mistake.","Section 8 may not be the quick fix you need to pay the rent.

The Emergency Broadband Benefit is the FCC’s newest program. They recently announced it as a way to give households a helping hand during the pandemic when it comes to Internet service. Since many businesses either closed or changed how they operated, getting online has become more critical than ever.

With this new benefit, the FCC hopes it can help households in need look for jobs, work at home, get virtual healthcare, and participate in online learning with very few out-of-pocket costs.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h3>What Is the Emergency Broadband Benefit?</h3>
As you can tell by its name, the Emergency Broadband Benefit is the FCC’s response to the need for Internet during the coronavirus outbreak, which is one of the most significant emergencies in quite some time. To make the monthly Internet bill more affordable, this benefit will offer $50 to eligible households that they can use to pay for broadband Internet. For families on Tribal lands, the benefit increases to $75 per month.

While that monthly stipend takes care of the Internet bill, households may need a device to get online as well. That’s why the Emergency Broadband Benefit will also provide a one-time $100 discount that can be used to purchase a desktop computer, laptop, or tablet. To use the discount, the device must be purchased from a participating provider. The household must also use $10-50 of its own money to make the purchase. Benefit recipients will get one monthly discount and one device discount per household.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>How to Qualify for the Emergency Broadband Benefit</h3>
Since this program intends to help those who need it most, you’ll need to show some form of financial need to qualify. There are several ways to do this, beginning with already being eligible for the FCC’s Lifeline program.

If you won a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year, that’s another way to qualify. So is having a child who received free or reduced lunches or school breakfasts during the 2019-2020 school year or the current year.

Did you suffer a significant loss of income since February 29, 2020? That combined with a household income below $99,000 for single filers could make you eligible. Joint filers will need income below $198,000.

Lastly, you can qualify for the Emergency Broadband Benefit if you’re eligible for a low-income or COVID-19 program from a participating provider.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h3>Other Affordable Internet Programs</h3>
Since the Emergency Broadband Benefit is not yet live, you may need another way to get affordable Internet. Comcast Internet Essentials offers service for only $9.95 per month, including two free months for new customers.

Mediacom Connect 2 Compete has 25Mbps Internet speeds for $9.95 per month as well. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T’s Access program can get you online for less than $10 per month with no overage fees, as they waived them during the pandemic.","The Internet is now a necessity due to the coronavirus pandemic.

3021,"Still Looking For Your Coronavirus Stimulus Payments?","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Not receiving your coronavirus stimulus checks can be stressful, especially in tough times like these, where every penny counts.

Many breathed a sigh of relief when the government announced it was providing stimulus payments in response to the pandemic. With so many people losing their jobs and income, the announcement was a small silver lining during some very dark times.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Unfortunately, everyone hasn’t received their stimulus checks yet. If you’re one of them, we’ll reveal the number one thing you can do to get your Economic Impact Payments, and how much money you can expect.
<h3>Coronavirus Stimulus Checks Background</h3>
If you haven’t been paying too much attention to the news because you want to keep things positive, here’s a bit of a background on the stimulus checks or Economic Impact Payments.

They were first approved in March of last year. The government created the checks to inject some much-needed movement into the stagnant economy. More importantly, it made them to give families funds to buy food and take care of some of their bills. The second round of checks, meanwhile, was announced during December 2020.
<h3>COVID-19 Stimulus Payment Amounts</h3>
If you received your first round of Economic Impact Payments, you probably know that they provided each eligible adult with $1,200. Dependent children received $500.

Depending on your household size, those amounts could have added up to a decent-sized check. But with the second round of payments, the payouts dropped.

Instead of giving each eligible adult $1,200, the second stimulus offered just $600. Dependent children saw their payouts increase to $600.

As for how the funds were disbursed, you have a few options. The government mailed out prepaid debit cards and checks. Some people, however, received their stimulus payments by direct deposit to a bank account. This bank account is whatever you used to receive Social Security and other federal benefits or your tax refund.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h3>Missing Payments</h3>
Although news of stimulus payments was great, not receiving those payouts has been a disappointment for some. If you’re still waiting on coronavirus stimulus checks, make sure you’ve filed your 2020 tax return. Even if you never file returns, you’ll have to do so this time around if you want to receive that stimulus money. For help with filing your return, visit the MyFreeTaxes website.

If you filed a return and are wondering about your stimulus payment status, a quick call to the 211 Economic Impact Payment Helpline at 844-322-3639 may give you some clarity. IRS-certified volunteers can help point you in the right direction as well.
<h3>Qualifying for COVID-19 Stimulus Payments</h3>
One big reason why you may still be waiting on stimulus checks is that you don’t qualify. To be eligible for Economic Impact Payments, you’ll need the following:
<ul>
 	<li>A Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Status as a U.S citizen or resident alien</li>
 	<li>Not be listed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return</li>
 	<li>Adjusted gross income under $75,000 as an individual, $112,500 as a head of household, or $150,000 as a married couple filing jointly.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

If you received stimulus payments lower than those amounts listed at the beginning of this article, it could be because your income exceeds the standard limits. You can receive smaller stimulus payments if your individual, head of household, or married income is below $99,000, $136,500, or $198,000, respectively.","We’ll fill you in on what’s needed to receive your checks, plus more.","2021-04-02 02:55:39",post,https://spaoa.org/still-looking-for-your-coronavirus-stimulus-payments/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1248016774.jpg,shutterstock_1248016774.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1248016774.jpg,3022,shutterstock_1248016774,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1248016774.jpg,"Covid Relief","Covid Relief",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,still-looking-for-your-coronavirus-stimulus-payments,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-06 16:01:28"
3024,"How To Lower Your Bills While COVID-19 Is Still Here","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

See how to lower your Internet, phone, and utility bills so you can keep them all connected without emptying your pockets.

Did you lose income during the pandemic? You probably did. In fact, you may have even lost your job, making it nearly impossible to keep up with your bills.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Instead of letting those bills pile to the sky, we’ll show you what you can do to get financial assistance or start paying less per month. At the very least, you can buy some time and keep your services turned on by following these simple tips:
<h4>1. Don’t ignore your bills.</h4>
The stress from the pandemic can make you want to pile all of your bills in a corner and never open them. But if you do that, you’ll find yourself living with the lights off, no Internet, no phone, etc.

To keep your bills from getting out of control, contact each company. This means getting on the phone with your power, water, gas, phone, and Internet companies and telling them you’re having trouble with payments. This is so common due to the pandemic that many companies will be willing to work with you, so you don’t lose service and don’t go bankrupt.

A quick call could result in a lower monthly payment. It could get you a significant one-time discount. You could be put on a manageable payment plan. Or, you could have your bill postponed, so you get a bit of breathing room. All of those options are much better than doing nothing at all.
<h4>2. Get instant help from 211.</h4>
Dial 211 into your phone. Speak to a local operator. Tell them you need help with paying your bills. That’s all it takes to get instant “inside information” on how to find financial assistance for utility bills, housing, healthcare, food, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Lower your Internet bill to just $10 per month.</h4>
You can’t cut the Internet from your monthly budget, especially during a pandemic. COVID-19 has forced us to spend more time inside, which has led to more hours spent browsing online.

But chances are, you use the Internet to do much more than browse now, as you may be working from home or your kids could be taking online classes.

To drop your Internet costs bigtime, try one of these low-cost programs that could set you back as little as 10 bucks per month:
<ul>
 	<li>Access from AT&amp;T</li>
 	<li>Comcast Internet Essentials</li>
 	<li>Mediacom Connect 2 Compete</li>
 	<li>Verizon Lifeline</li>
 	<li>EveryoneOn</li>
</ul>
If you don’t feel like switching Internet service, do as mentioned above and call up your current provider. They can probably offer a discount or make your bill more manageable until the coronavirus goes away.

Since that can be tough during the coronavirus pandemic, here are some resources you can use to ensure your family stays fed.
<h3>Get Emergency Food Assistance</h3>
Are there programs out there that can give you money each month to fill your refrigerator? Sure, and we’ll discuss some of them in a minute. But here’s the truth about such programs: It takes time to receive their benefits, making them long-term solutions and not ideal for emergencies. With that being said, here’s what you should do if you need food right this second: Give 211 a call.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What is 211? It’s a number you can call whenever you need help with things like food, housing, healthcare, paying bills, and more. Think of it as a one-stop-shop for financial assistance, as 211’s operators are well-versed in local programs and organizations that can give you the help your family needs.
<h3>See What Food Help Your State Offers</h3>
Although 211 should be the first call you make when the coronavirus has cleared out your kitchen, your state agency should be number two on your list. Why? Because they know of every food assistance program available to residents in your state, and they can tell you what’s needed to start receiving benefits soon.

The USDA has an easy-to-use tool that can help you <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">find your state agency here</a>.
<h3>Long-Term Food Assistance Solutions</h3>
Right now, many families are suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic, as it’s created income loss that makes it hard to buy food and pay the bills. While using 211 can get you connected to emergency food assistance in the form of food banks and free meal deliveries, you may want something to provide stability down the line. If so, try these food programs that can offer assistance even once the coronavirus is gone for good:

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Food Stamps</h4>
How different would your life be if you received funds every month to buy food? It would probably be less stressful, as you wouldn’t have to worry so much about your family’s nutrition. With food stamps (aka SNAP), you can get those funds loaded onto an EBT card. Use it at the grocery store like a credit card, and you can buy food without putting a dent in your bank account.

In response to the coronavirus, the government has made it easier to get SNAP while also increasing the benefits. In short, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">there’s no better time to apply than now.</a>
<h4>WIC</h4>
While food stamps are great, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">WIC is ideal for pregnant women, infants, and children</a>. With WIC, you can purchase necessities like infant food, baby formula, milk, fruits, veggies, and more.
<h4>School Food Programs</h4>
Are you worried about your children’s nutrition a lot more since the pandemic appeared? If your kitchen is cleaned out due to a lack of funds, the answer is probably yes.

To fix this issue, see if your children qualify for the <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">School Breakfast Program</a> and the <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">National School Lunch Program</a>. Both can help alleviate your worries for at least two meals per day.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Food Assistance for Seniors</h4>
If one segment of the population has it particularly tough during the pandemic, it’s seniors. Not only are they at a higher risk for severe complications with COVID-19, but they also have to live on a fixed income.

If you know of a senior needing food assistance, look into the <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/csfp/commodity-supplemental-food-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Commodity Supplemental Food Program</a> and the <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfmnp/senior-farmers-market-nutrition-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program</a>.

Trying to fix your homeless situation can be tricky, especially if you were just evicted and you can’t rely on friends and family for temporary housing. And if you’ve never been homeless before, fixing your situation can be even more challenging as you ponder what it’s like to live in a shelter.

Many would like to avoid homeless shelters at all costs due to sanitary and safety concerns. This makes homeless hotel/motel vouchers a popular alternative, even though they’re hard to find and only offer a few nights of housing. Still, getting a few nights to stay in a hotel or motel may be all you need to clear your head and think of ways to find employment and a place of your own. To help you achieve that goal, here are some tips for finding that ever-elusive hotel voucher.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
<h4>Where to Search For Your Hotel Voucher First</h4>
If you haven’t contacted the following homeless resources, do so as soon as possible. They are common sources of hotel/motel vouchers for the homeless, and are an excellent place to begin your search:
<ul>
 	<li>211 – Just dial 211 on your phone and speak to the operator</li>
 	<li>Catholic Charities</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army</li>
 	<li>Your local homeless shelter – Even if you don’t want to stay there, ask one of the workers if they know where to find hotel vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Homeless assistance programs in your city, county, or state – You can find these by searching online or visiting this link.</li>
</ul>
Go down that list and contact each of those resources. If that doesn’t yield any luck, move on to the following options.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->
<h4>Other Possible Contacts for Homeless Hotel Vouchers</h4>
While these resources may not specialize in motel or hotel vouchers for the homeless, they probably know of places that can help you find what you’re looking for. And when contacting them, you can also ask about other homeless services, such as food assistance, healthcare, and more.
<ul>
 	<li>Continuum of Care (CoC)</li>
 	<li>National Healthcare for the Homeless Council</li>
 	<li>National Coalition for Homeless Veterans</li>
 	<li>National Coalition for the Homeless</li>
</ul>
You can also try to contact a HUD housing counselor to find a hotel/motel voucher. The Just Shelter website may be of help too. Lastly, this site from the HUD can connect you with homeless resources in your state.

Whenever you speak to someone about a hotel voucher, be sure to let them know your entire situation. Depending on your circumstances, you could get priority for a homeless motel voucher since they are so limited. In some locations, these circumstances can land you priority status for a hotel voucher:
<ul>
 	<li>Domestic violence victim</li>
 	<li>Victim of a disaster, such as a flood, fire, or hurricane.</li>
 	<li>Senior</li>
 	<li>Disabled</li>
 	<li>Single parent</li>
 	<li>Single male</li>
</ul>
[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->
<h4>How to Maintain Your Homeless Hotel Voucher</h4>
Even though a voucher may only give you three nights in a hotel or motel, you don’t want to lose it. Keeping this in mind, be sure to follow the voucher agency's rules, so you do not lose that privilege. Here are some standard hotel voucher rules that homeless recipients must follow:
<ul>
 	<li>Check-in with the agency.</li>
 	<li>Show proof of employment or that you are looking for a job.</li>
 	<li>Meet with a counselor to create a plan to escape homelessness.</li>
</ul>","Getting your hands on a homeless hotel voucher can be challenging. If you’re struggling in your motel voucher search, these resources may lead to success.","2021-06-27 05:00:31",post,https://spaoa.org/cant-find-a-homeless-hotel-voucher-try-these-resources/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1074560354.jpg,shutterstock_1074560354.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1074560354.jpg,3042,"Young,Migrant,Or,Victim,Of,Terrorism,With,Glass,Of,Water",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1074560354.jpg,Resources,"Rental Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,cant-find-a-homeless-hotel-voucher-try-these-resources,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-18 21:36:14"
3056,"The 6 Best Retailers And Grocery Stores For Your Free Flu Shot","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Want to kill two birds with one stone so you can save gas on extra trips? Get your flu shot at the grocery store or while shopping at your favorite retailer. Now’s the time to do so, as the flu will probably stick around until April or May.

While some people feel like the flu shot isn’t worth it, you can get it for free if you have health insurance. And if you do get it, you can help prevent the flu or lessen your symptoms if you get sick. Both of those benefits make the vaccination worth your time, as you could miss work if the flu hits, which could result in a loss of income, a need to visit the doctor, having to buy medicine, etc.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Getting Your Flu Shot at a Retailer or Grocery Store</h4>
When you think of getting a vaccine, you probably have a trip to the doctor’s office in mind.
However, with the flu shot, that’s not necessary, as there are options all around you that can strengthen your defenses.

As mentioned, flu shots are often free as long as you have health insurance. But if you don’t, you can still get vaccinated without having to spend a pretty penny in some of the following locations. If you’re low on cash, call them first to see what they charge for those without insurance:
<ol>
 	<li>Target – Accepts both walk-ins and appointments for flu shots.</li>
 	<li>Walmart – Use the Walmart mobile app to schedule your appointment.</li>
 	<li>Publix – Both walk-ins and appointments (via their website) are okay.</li>
 	<li>Costco – No insurance? Get your flu shot here for as little as $19.99.</li>
 	<li>Safeway – You can get a 10 percent discount on your next shopping trip with a flu shot from Safeway.</li>
 	<li>Kroger – Their pharmacy offers the flu vaccine via appointment.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Other Flu Shot Options</h4>
The VaccineFinder website is an excellent tool for finding vaccination spots near you. Here are other places besides retailers and grocery stores that offer free or low-cost flu shots:
<h4>Pharmacies</h4>
As expected, large pharmacy chains offer flu vaccines. If you don’t have insurance, Rite Aid can get you vaccinated against the flu for $39.99. Walgreens offers flu shots by appointment or walk-in. And CVS is vaccinating through their standard locations and Minute Clinics.
<h4>Community Health Centers</h4>
If you want to get your flu shot but don’t have insurance and are low on cash, use this site to find your nearest community health center. They may offer complimentary flu vaccines regardless of insurance.
<h4>Doctors and Urgent Care Clinics</h4>
Both tend to offer flu shots that are free or affordable. Call beforehand to see what they charge for the visit, however.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Work and College Campuses</h4>
You may find on-site vaccinations at your workplace or on your college campus if you’re a student.
<h4>For Veterans</h4>
If you’re in the VA healthcare system, you can use your veteran status to get free flu vaccinations at urgent care clinics, in-network pharmacies, or VA healthcare facilities.","You don’t have to go far to get a free flu shot, as many of your favorite retailers and grocery stores can get you vaccinated.","2021-05-04 16:15:19",post,https://spaoa.org/the-6-best-retailers-and-grocery-stores-for-your-free-flu-shot/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_329102750.png,shutterstock_329102750.png,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_329102750.png,3057,shutterstock_329102750,,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_329102750.png,Resources,,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,the-6-best-retailers-and-grocery-stores-for-your-free-flu-shot,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 14:03:04"
3072,"See How The American Families Plan Could Improve Your Child’s Nutrition","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The American Families Plan is making the news, as the President unveiled what it would entail. While the plan tackles several issues in the U.S., it offers a significant investment in boosting children's nutrition across the country, and with good reason.

The issue of food insecurity has been around for years. With the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it’s become even worse, especially for low-income households. While they may have been struggling to put food on the table before, job and income loss caused by the coronavirus made it nearly impossible for these households to meet their nutritional needs. And since schools shut down as well, many children in those households ran the risk of going hungry due to no more reduced-price breakfasts or lunches.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

President Biden believes that all children should receive the nutrition they need. If they don’t, they can be physically and mentally impacted to the point that they cannot learn and grow. And if their success is stunted at an early age, that could carry on into adulthood, making it impossible for them to exit the cycle of poverty they currently find themselves in.

A diet lacking in healthy foods has been proven to increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and other diseases in children. And since 20 percent of children suffer from obesity, their futures can look bleak if they continue to carry extra weight as they age, as those risks will only get higher.

Obese adults put a massive burden on this country’s healthcare system. They also decrease work productivity due to sick days. Studies have shown that even the military can be hampered by health problems linked to obesity, putting our nation’s security at risk.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

All of these issues can be reduced or avoided by tackling food insecurity when children are young. With a $45 billion nutrition investment, that’s what Biden’s American Families Plan aims to do.
<h3>Children’s Nutrition Improvements That the American Families Plan Could Provide</h3>
There are three main ways in which the American Families Plan looks to tackle food insecurity amongst our youth:
<h4>1. $1 Billion to Incentivize Healthy Foods</h4>
The more healthy foods schools include in their meals, the better for our kids. To ensure schools do everything they can to improve the nutritional value of their meals, the American Families plan will invest $1 billion. This money will go to schools that exceed nutritional standards with their menus via increased meal reimbursement rates.
<h4>2. $17 Billion to Increase School Meals Participation</h4>
The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) covers meals for all students at high-poverty schools.
Through a $17 billion investment, the President aims to make the CEP more accessible by easing eligibility requirements. If successful, this would feed 9.3 million more children with school meals.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>3. $25 Billion to Make Summer Pandemic-EBT Permanent</h4>
When schools closed during the pandemic, many families wondered how they’d replace their children’s free or reduced-price meals. Summer Pandemic-EBT filled this void by giving families funds to buy food, and Biden hopes to make it permanent with a $25 billion investment that would feed 29 million children.","If President Biden’s newly announced American Families plan gets approved, it could mean improved benefits when it comes to your children’s nutrition.  ","2021-05-13 16:18:24",post,https://spaoa.org/see-how-the-american-families-plan-could-improve-your-childs-nutrition/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_136390613.jpg,shutterstock_136390613.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_136390613.jpg,3073,"Healthy,Child,Showing,His,Arm,Muscles,And,Sitting,On,A",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_136390613.jpg,Resources,"Food Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,see-how-the-american-families-plan-could-improve-your-childs-nutrition,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-07-08 15:39:06"

Think of some of the problems you currently have that could go away if things became more affordable. You may have issues paying for your children’s child care. You or your child may want to get a college degree, but you have no idea how to pay for it.

You may have problems putting food on the table. Or, you may be unemployed and need some money coming in to keep up with expenses since you can’t work.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

All of those are common problems that many families face, which is why President Biden put together his American Families Plan. While the plan has many moving parts, we’ll discuss the ones that could affect your everyday life the most should the plan get approved.
<h4>Unemployment</h4>
The coronavirus pandemic caused many businesses to shutter. As those businesses closed, employees lost their livelihoods. Unemployment benefits helped people out of work stay afloat, but President Biden believes this area could use a lot of improvement.

Through the American Families Plan, unemployment insurance would be overhauled to prevent fraud and become more accessible. What does this mean for you? That should you ever need it, unemployment would hit your bank account quickly so you could keep up with your expenses.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Education</h4>
The cost of college keeps going up, which is probably why enrollment keeps going down. Many may want to go to college to get a degree or certification, but can’t due to all of the expenses involved. The American Families Plan would tackle this issue head-on by making community college free.

If all goes according to plan, you could get your community college degree and take four years to do so. Why is this important? Because many who go to school have kids to take care of or work multiple jobs. By having more time to get your degree, you’ll be able to cover your other responsibilities without having to pay a penny for college.

5.5 million students could benefit from free community college thanks to the American Families Plan. And students could also benefit from a proposed increase to the maximum Pell Grant benefit, which would grow by $1,400.

While free college and increased grant amounts are outstanding, you could also take advantage of retention and completion services through the American Families Plan. This means added child care benefits, mental health services, emergency grants, and more that could help you push past any bumps in the road during your college career.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Child Care</h4>
Kids aged three to four would get free preschool through the American Families Plan. Child care would also become more affordable, as families who need it most wouldn’t have to pay a thing. Others would pay according to income on a sliding scale.
<h4>Food</h4>
Do you worry about your kids’ nutrition during the summer months when there’s no school? Since Summer Pandemic-EBT would become permanent under the American Families plan, you wouldn’t have to worry anymore. Why? Because you’d get money to pay for food during the summer.","You may have heard about the American Families Plan in the news lately. But do you know what’s in it?

3093,"Can You Buy Anything You Want With Your SNAP EBT Card?","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

We’ll fill you in, so you don’t make any grocery shopping mistakes.

Has putting food on your family’s table become a challenge? If so, you’re certainly not alone. But that probably doesn’t make you feel any better about your situation.

What could help you feel better is getting approved for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Better known as food stamps, SNAP can give you funds each month to buy food, so your family’s nutrition doesn’t lack.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>The Primary Purpose of SNAP</h4>
As you can tell by its name, SNAP is meant to supplement nutrition. In other words, it’s not a complete replacement for your family’s monthly grocery shopping needs. Could you receive enough benefits for that to happen? Sure. But you shouldn’t count on SNAP solely to feed your family, as you’ll probably need other funds as well.

It’s worth noting that SNAP is also based on need. Households who need nutrition assistance the most should apply for SNAP, as you will have to show financial need to be approved for the program.
<h4>Receiving SNAP Funds</h4>
Have you ever seen what the old food stamps looked like? They were food coupons you could use at the store to help pay for your grocery bill. However, those are gone, and SNAP now issues EBT cards that function like credit or debit cards.

Just swipe your EBT card at the store, and it will pay for SNAP-eligible items so you can keep more money in your pocket.
<h4>Where to Use SNAP Cards</h4>
Many stores that accept EBT cards say so at the entrance. In general, you can use your EBT card at places like:
<ul>
 	<li>Grocery stores</li>
 	<li>Gas stations</li>
 	<li>Convenience stores</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

Some farmers' markets accept SNAP cards, which is excellent news if you’re looking to take your health to another level. Other stores that may accept SNAP include:
<ul>
 	<li>Walgreens</li>
 	<li>CVS</li>
 	<li>Target</li>
 	<li>Walmart</li>
</ul>
Buying groceries online has exploded lately, especially with the coronavirus pandemic and the need for social distancing. Keeping this in mind, your state may allow for online purchases of food using your SNAP EBT card. To confirm, contact your nearest SNAP office and ask if online purchases are okay.
<h4>What You Can and Cannot Buy With Your EBT Card</h4>
Food stamps are meant for nutritional necessities. In short, you won’t be able to buy whatever you want with your EBT card. The following items are acceptable:
<ul>
 	<li>Bread</li>
 	<li>Cereal</li>
 	<li>Condiments</li>
 	<li>Dairy</li>
 	<li>Fats</li>
 	<li>Fish</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Meat</li>
 	<li>Non-alcoholic drinks</li>
 	<li>Oils</li>
 	<li>Pasta</li>
 	<li>Poultry</li>
 	<li>Rice</li>
 	<li>Seeds/plants for growing your own produce</li>
 	<li>Snacks and desserts</li>
 	<li>Spices/flavor extracts</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

These items, meanwhile, are not eligible for purchase with your SNAP EBT card:
<ul>
 	<li>Alcohol</li>
 	<li>Cleaning supplies</li>
 	<li>Health and beauty products</li>
 	<li>Household supplies</li>
 	<li>Live animals</li>
 	<li>Medication</li>
 	<li>Prepared foods</li>
 	<li>Supplements</li>
 	<li>Tobacco products</li>
 	<li>Vitamins</li>
</ul>
So, even though you can’t buy everything with your SNAP card, you can see how much it can help with your monthly groceries. And since SNAP can provide such help, be sure to contact your local office if your EBT card gets lost or stolen, as you will have to wait about a week to get a replacement.","If you’re thinking about applying for SNAP or food stamps, you’re probably wondering what you can buy with those benefits.

What did people fear most once COVID-19 appeared out of nowhere? Getting infected probably topped the list. But close to that was a financial fear of what would happen after losing your job, which happened for many once businesses were forced to shut down due to restrictions.

You can’t pay your rent if you’re not working and don’t have significant savings. And even if you did have a decent emergency fund, the coronavirus is still kicking one year later.

Thanks to the Centers for Disease Control, eviction from your home may not have to be a worry.
And this is true even if you haven’t been able to pay the rent in several months. But does an eviction moratorium mean you can live rent-free? And is everyone eligible for this program? Let’s discuss that now.
<h4>What the CDC Eviction Moratorium Really Means</h4>
Many are making the mistake of thinking that due to the eviction moratorium, rent is forgiven. In other words, they think they can live rent-free and not have to pay the landlord a dime.

This isn’t true, as the CDC Eviction Moratorium only keeps you from being evicted for not paying the rent. Once the moratorium ends, however, you will have to pay any months you missed, plus all of the fees and interest.

As you can imagine, this back rent can add up to quite a hefty sum, which is why anyone eligible for the eviction moratorium must also work out a payment plan with the landlord.
Keep this in mind if you’ve been splurging on spending but not paying the rent. It will be due one day.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>CDC Eviction Moratorium Extension</h4>
The eviction moratorium was recently extended to June 30, 2021. If eligible, you will receive eviction protection until that date.
<h4>You Can Still Be Evicted</h4>
A landlord cannot evict you during the moratorium for nonpayment of rent. They can evict you if you are violating the terms of your lease, so it’s best to be on good terms with your landlord while the moratorium is in play.
<h4>All Buildings Are Covered</h4>
Whether the property is some type of federal housing or is privately owned, it’s covered under the CDC Eviction Moratorium. Homes, apartments, mobile homes, and land leased as a residence all fall under the moratorium’s umbrella. Guesthouses, hotels, and motels do not, as they are temporary residences.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>You’ll Need to Apply</h4>
A declaration form will determine whether you’re eligible for the CDC Eviction Moratorium. You can find the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/evictiondeclare_d508.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">form here</a>.

You and any other adults who signed the rental lease agreement will need to complete the form and submit it to the landlord, property owner, or property manager. Be sure to get proof that they received it for your records.

The form is straightforward and will tell you whether or not you qualify for the eviction moratorium. Make sure all of your answers are truthful to avoid legal issues.","The CDC Eviction Moratorium can give your family housing stability while the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

3180,"A Single Parent’s Guide To Getting Rent Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

When you’re raising children on your own, you have to play both mother and father roles. This not only requires a considerable time investment, but a monetary one as well.

What’s one of the biggest budget busters for single parents? Paying the rent, and with housing prices that seem to be growing higher, this can be a significant concern for many single-parent households.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->
How can you keep a roof over your family’s head with evergrowing expenses? One of the most straightforward solutions would be to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://spaoa.org/can-you-make-good-money-doing-odd-jobs-off-the-internet/"" rel=""noopener"">get a second job</a> or work extra hours. However, with kids, this isn’t so simple, as you’ll need to pay someone to take care of them while you work.

What’s another option for making rent more affordable? Rental assistance from the government, charities, churches, and the like. Here are some of your best bets.
<h3>Where to Get Help Paying Your Rent</h3>
There are many options for single parent rental assistance. If none in this list suits your needs, keep looking, and you’ll surely find the right fit.
<h4>FEMA</h4>
Sometimes, you may run into rent issues due to no fault of your own. Disasters strike all across the country, either natural or humanmade. If you can’t pay the rent specifically due to a disaster, don’t fret, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may help through its Individuals and Households Program (IHP).

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Section 8</h4>
A disaster can make it impossible to pay the rent temporarily. If, however, you find it hard to pay the rent every month due to your duties as a single parent, Section 8 can make long-term housing much more affordable.

The federal government’s Housing Choice Voucher Program helps low-income households live in safe, sanitary, and decent homes or apartments. If you qualify, the government can take a huge financial load off of your shoulders every month, as you will only have to pay a portion of your income towards the rent. Your housing voucher will pay the rest, allowing you to save money for childcare, an emergency fund, etc.
<h4>Public Housing</h4>
Another form of long-term rental assistance for single parents is public housing. While Section 8 helps pay a portion of your rent in suitable housing you choose, public housing is a bit different.

You can learn more about public housing <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a> if you find that paying the rent for your own place isn’t manageable anymore.
<h4>Housing Counseling Assistance Program</h4>
Here’s a resource that works well if you want hands-on help with figuring out your best housing options as a single parent. A housing counselor can give you advice on making rent more affordable, as well as programs that offer such assistance.
<h4>Socialserve</h4>
This nonprofit organization can make your rent more affordable by helping you find lower-cost housing. By cutting your monthly payment, you won’t have to worry as much about paying the rent on your own while raising your children.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Emergency Rental Assistance for Single Parents</h4>
If your rent is due immediately and you fear that you and your children are on the cusp of eviction, here are the three best places to contact for emergency rent assistance:
<ul>
 	<li>Catholic Charities</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army</li>
 	<li>211</li>

You’ve probably heard or seen the term “HUD” before, but if you never knew what it meant, here’s its full name: The Department of Housing and Urban Development.

What does this agency do? It administers <a href=""https://spaoa.org/tips-for-getting-into-section-8s-affordable-housing/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">programs that make housing more accessible</a> and affordable for low-income families. And while you may know that the HUD’s Section 8 program makes it a lot cheaper to pay the rent, you’ll be happy to know that HUD homes make it a lot cheaper to buy a house.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Affordable HUD Homes</h4>
FHA loans come from the Federal Housing Administration. Unlike standard loans, these forms of financing make it easier to get approved since they don’t carry these typical requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>A high credit score.</li>
 	<li>A large down payment.</li>
 	<li>Expensive closing costs.</li>
</ul>
Instead, you may get an FHA loan if your credit score is low. Your down payment can be as low as 3.5 percent of the home’s purchase price, which is lower than what you’d usually need. And you may get help with closing costs for even more savings.

What happens if an FHA loan borrower can’t make their payments and ends up defaulting? The HUD steps in. They pay the lender whatever amount is remaining on the loan. Once that’s complete, the HUD owns the home. What’s that home called? You guessed it – a HUD home.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

Instead of holding on to the home, the HUD tries to sell it as quickly as possible. They do this by listing the home at a lower price than the market, so people are enticed to buy it.
<h4>Buying a HUD Home</h4>
If you plan on living on the property for at least a year, you pass the first requirement for owning a HUD home. In other words, if you want to buy it as an investor, you’ll have to wait until people who want to reside in the home get a shot at purchasing it first.

To find a HUD home, visit the HUDHomeStore. It’s the best place to search for HUD homes, as you won’t find them listed publicly as other properties are.

If you find a HUD home you like, you’ll need to hire a HUD-approved real estate agent. Only they will be able to view and bid on the home for you, as these properties are sold separately at auctions.

If you win the auction, you’ll have one to two months to close on the home. You can finance a HUD home with typical loans used to buy any other houses. Conventional loans from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are often used, as are VA loans. And if you think your credit score is low or you don’t have a ton of cash available, the aforementioned FHA loan could be your best option.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Here are some additional points worth mentioning about HUD homes:
<ul>
 	<li>Their lower prices may be the perfect fit if you’re worried about the rising costs of real estate.</li>
 	<li>You could enjoy an extremely low down payment if you qualify for the HUD $100 Down Program.</li>
 	<li>The HUD may pay five percent of the home’s purchase price in closing costs.</li>
 	<li>HUD homes are sold as-is, so you may need to spend money on repairs. Inspections are crucial before moving in, as they can tell you any possible additional investment that could be required.</li>
</ul>","If you don’t know what a HUD home is, now’s the time to learn, as it could allow you to own a house without having to spend a ton of money in the process.

3186,"Do This Before Participating In Medicare Open Enrollment","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The fall season brings with it changing leaves, as well as Medicare Open Enrollment. From October 15 to December 7, this period gives people a chance to <a href=""https://spaoa.org/4-reasons-to-start-using-telemedicine-for-your-healthcare-needs/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">switch their healthcare options</a> for the upcoming year.

During open enrollment, you can join, switch, or drop the following plans:
<ul>
 	<li>Medicare Advantage</li>
 	<li>Medicare Part D</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Open enrollment does not apply to supplemental or Medigap plans.

If you’re looking to take advantage of this period to tinker with Advantage or Part D plans, here’s what you should do before taking action.
<h4>1. Take a closer look at your Annual Notice of Change</h4>
Before open enrollment kicked off, you should have received the ANOC or Annual Notice of Change in the mail. This document details any changes to the coverage or cost of your plan for the coming year. If you haven’t yet looked at your ANOC, open it up now and consider a couple of things.

First, have a look at the costs of any drugs you take or the services you use. Also, look at the service’s locations, as you want them to be close and convenient. If your plan’s pharmacies or network of providers are too far away, they may need some changing so that the policy better fits your needs.

Second, take a minute and think about how your healthcare needs changed in the last year. If they remained the same, your plan might suffice as-is. However, if they changed, and you now require different services or need to see new specialists, some adjustments may be in order.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>2. Determine your coverage needs.</h4>
Now that you know what your ANOC contains and what to expect, plus you know how your healthcare needs have changed, it’s time to think about coverage. Do you want to add coverage or switch your Advantage or Part D plans? Before making any changes, you’ll need to keep some things in mind.

When looking at plans and coverage options, analyze the providers and services. Be sure to include any treatments, specialists, doctors, and supplemental benefits while making this observation. As you compare plans, pay attention to the limits on each benefit.

You also want to consider drug coverage. Does the plan cover the prescriptions you’ll need next year? Will they require approval? Are there any quantity limits or other restrictions on the drugs?

Lastly, you want to think about out-of-pocket costs for hospital stays, doctor visits, prescriptions, etc.. Many plans have an annual maximum for out-of-pocket expenses that do not include prescription costs.
<h4>3. Get help.</h4>
As you review coverage options, it’s not uncommon to get confused, especially since there are so many things to consider. Luckily, you can get help with choosing a Medicare plan during open enrollment from various sources.

If you want to make shopping for plans easier, call 1-800-MEDICARE or use the <a href=""https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/?lang=en&amp;year=2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Medicare Plan Finder</a>.

If cutting costs and understanding your options is your goal, get in contact with SHIP or your State Health Insurance Program by visiting shiptacenter.org or calling 877-839-2675.

Finally, the <a href=""https://www.mymedicarematters.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">My Medicare Matters tool</a> from the National Council on Aging can help educate you on coverage options, so you make the right choice.","Medicare Open Enrollment is now in full swing.

3209,"Biden’s American Families Plan Looks To Tackle Food Insecurity For Kids","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h3>The Importance of Tackling Food Insecurity</h3>
Food insecurity was already an issue before the coronavirus pandemic hit. But once COVID-19 appeared, it made the nutrition situation for low-income families even worse.

Providing nutritious food for children is a worry that no family should have. A diet lacking in nutrient-rich, healthy foods can negatively impact a child’s ability to learn. This can make it impossible for them to succeed in school, holding them back from progressing through life and making it out of the poverty cycle.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Beyond those negative consequences, poor nutrition has also been proven to hurt overall health. Children with lacking diets are at a higher risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and other serious ailments. Nearly one out of five children in the U.S. are obese, which increases the likelihood of obesity continuing into adulthood.

What happens when children carry obesity into adulthood? It can put a considerable burden on the healthcare system. Beyond that, prevalent obesity can hamper work productivity, increase sick days, and even hurt the military's readiness, which can threaten our national security.

While many argue that it’s a parent’s responsibility to feed their children at home, studies show that kids get the most nutrition from their school meals. This shows the critical role the federal government can play in optimizing children’s health, which is why President Biden’s American Families Plan aims to spread a $45 billion investment among various nutrition programs.
<h3>Nutrition Highlights of the American Families Plan</h3>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Increase Summer EBT Benefits</h4>
Low-income families have relied on Summer EBT to buy food when school is out. It serves as a replacement for reduced-price and free meals kids enjoy during the school year.

Studies have shown that Summer EBT successfully tackled food insecurity and improved children’s nutrition. Under the American Families Plan, Summer Pandemic-EBT would become permanent via a $25 billion investment. With it, 29 million children could continue to receive funds for summer meals.
<h4>Make School Meals More Accessible</h4>
High-poverty schools can offer free meals to their entire student bodies through the Community Eligibility Provision. Entire school districts can qualify for this free meal program as long as 40 percent of the students come from families receiving SNAP benefits. Thanks to the program, kids from families who may not understand the application process are covered. More important, kids can avoid the negative stigma that may come with receiving free meals.

At this time, only 70 percent of schools have enrolled in CEP. Biden hopes to increase that number by improving reimbursement to schools and lowering the eligibility threshold for the program. He plans to do this through a $17 billion investment. The result would give an extra 9.3 million children free meals, with many being in elementary schools.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Encourage Healthy Food Usage</h4>
The American Families Plan also aims to invest $1 billion to give schools an incentive to offer healthy foods on their menus. For instance, if a school exceeds healthy offering standards with its meals, it could receive a higher reimbursement rate.","See how the American Families Plan could increase school food benefits to help improve your children’s nutrition and overall health.","2021-05-16 15:38:48",post,https://spaoa.org/bidens-american-families-plan-looks-to-tackle-food-insecurity-for-kids/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_139406255.jpg,shutterstock_139406255.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_139406255.jpg,3210,"Elementary,Pupils,Enjoying,Healthy,Lunch,In,Cafeteria",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_139406255.jpg,Resources,"Emergency Assistance|Food Assistance",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,bidens-american-families-plan-looks-to-tackle-food-insecurity-for-kids,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-26 20:03:40"

<h4>Federal Pell Grants Explained</h4>
Undergraduate students can get Federal Pell Grants worth as much as $6,495 annually. Unlike student loans that must be repaid along with interest, these grants are essentially free money since no repayment is necessary.

To qualify for a Pell Grant, you will need to attend a particular type of institution in your quest to get a degree, and you will also have to show a specific level of need.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Pell Grant Uses</h4>
While the fact that Pell Grants can give you up to $6,495 towards your yearly education is excellent, their flexibility might be even better. Since every situation is different, you may have costs that other students don’t. With a Pell Grant, you can cover a wide range of costs such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Books</li>
 	<li>Tuition</li>
 	<li>Housing</li>
 	<li>Child care</li>
 	<li>Dependent care</li>
</ul>
Another way in which Pell Grants are flexible is the types of schooling they can be used for. Since virtual learning has exploded in popularity, you’ll be glad to know that you can use a Pell Grant to go to an online school to get your degree without having to step into an official classroom. As long as the online school is accredited, your Pell Grant funds can pay for associated costs.

Speaking of flexibility and virtual learning, an online degree may be your best bet if you have a full-time job, children to take care of, or other responsibilities that make it tough to take classes on campus. And if you don’t want to wait until a new semester or term to start studying, some online degree programs let you begin when you are ready so that you can complete your studies quicker.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Pell Grant Myths</h4>
You would think that students would be lining up for $6,495 Pell Grants, but that’s not the case. Even though such money could be helpful for any student, many shy away from Pell Grants due to myths or misconceptions, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Thinking Pell Grants are just another student loan that must be repaid.</li>
 	<li>Thinking that qualifying for a Pell Grant is too difficult.</li>
 	<li>Not even knowing Pell Grants exist.</li>
</ul>
As mentioned, Pell Grants are not loans and do not have to be repaid.
They most certainly do exist, and as we’re about to show, qualifying for them is not too difficult.
<h4>Pell Grant Qualifications</h4>
Unlike other forms of financial aid like scholarships, loans, and some grants, Federal Pell Grants do not consider the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Credit score</li>
 	<li>Grades</li>
 	<li>Age</li>
 	<li>Other student aid you qualify for</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Instead, the following will be analyzed when you apply for a $6,495 Pell Grant:
<ul>
 	<li>Your student status (either full or part-time)</li>
 	<li>Any degrees you have</li>
 	<li>Whether or not you’ll study for a full academic year</li>
 	<li>Your institution’s status as a participating school (as judged by the Department of Education)</li>
 	<li>Your school’s attendance costs</li>
 	<li>Your financial need</li>
</ul>
<h4>Applying For a Pell Grant</h4>
To get a Pell Grant up to $6,495 per year, you will need to submit a FAFSA application. Once complete, that will not only determine how much of a Pell Grant you can receive, but it will also open up the doors for financial aid from any schools where you’d like to attend.","A yearly $6,495 grant would make your dream of getting a college degree a much more likely reality.

Can you find financial aid by going online and simply searching for “college scholarships”?

Sure, but that’s not necessarily the best way to look for free money. Scholarships and other forms of financial aid are often created by organizations to stimulate interest in specific fields. Or they’re created to help underrepresented people break into fields where there were too many barriers in the past.

For example, you can search for scholarships for women looking to study science. Why? Because women tend to be underrepresented in the science fields. To counteract this, many organizations have come up with scholarships to level the playing field.

So, if you think that scholarships are for “other people” and don’t exist for someone like you, think again. As you’ll see in this list, there are women's scholarships in varying amounts for different purposes. When you’re finished, don’t be discouraged if you don't see something that fits your needs.

Instead, start searching for financial aid in your city, county, state, field of study, race, etc. In doing so, you should be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to find free money for school.
<h3>Scholarships for Women</h3>
<h4>Women in Skilled Trades Scholarship</h4>

<h4>NASCAR / Brienne Davis Memorial Tuition Scholarship</h4>

<h4>1. Utilities</h4>
It would be nice if you could get rid of your utility bills altogether. But using water, light, gas, etc., is necessary for survival and comfort.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What’s one way to reduce your utility bills? Being more conscious of your usage and doing things to conserve utilities, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Taking quick showers.</li>
 	<li>Turning lights off when you’re not using them.</li>
 	<li>Unplugging devices.</li>
 	<li>Using a programmable thermostat.</li>
 	<li>And so on.</li>
</ul>
Can those moves lead to significant savings? Possibly, but they take a lot of work and discipline. What’s a better money-saving move? Seeing what utility assistance you can get. With the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), for example, you could get help paying your utility bills without having to make any changes to your usage.
<h4>2. Cell Phone</h4>
We use cell phones so much these days that they could be seen as necessary as utilities. Luckily, you don’t have to give up your cell phone to save in this department, as merely switching providers can keep a lot more cash in your pocket.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

The most popular cell phone providers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon can charge you a lot more for service than smaller companies can. Switch from one of the big three to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), and you could reduce your cell phone charges by 50 percent.

Don’t be fooled by the fancy MVNO name, as it just stands for companies (Google Fi, Consumer Cellular, Ting) that buy their minutes and data at wholesale prices from larger providers. Thanks to those wholesale purchases, they can pass on considerable savings to customers while still offering dependable service.
<h4>3. Car Insurance</h4>
Those pandemic discounts for driving less and staying at home seem to be drying up. If your car insurance has risen lately and you’re still driving less than 10,000 miles, opt for a “pay-per-mile” rate. Offered by companies like Nationwide, Allstate, and Metromile, it can cut your car insurance bill by 33 percent by charging you based on how much you drive.

How much can a pay-per-mile rate save you? Since average savings are around 33 percent, which equals over $400 per year, the answer is a lot.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>4. Cable</h4>
Many households are cutting the cord and ditching cable altogether. You could take that sometimes complicated route, or you could call your cable company and ask if they have budget tiers with fewer channels.

A Nielsen study discovered that the average household watches just 17 of the 200 channels available. By switching to a budget tier with fewer channels, you can pay less by getting rid of content you don’t watch.","Are you throwing away money each month on bills when you could be paying a lot less?

You may be short on money, which can make it tough to pay your bills. But if you’re short on time, that can be even worse, as it doesn’t leave you much room in your busy schedule to apply for additional employment.

What should you do in such a situation? You could ask for help from friends and family, but they may have their own issues to take care of. You could also get a personal loan, but that will put you in debt with interest that’s likely high. And while applying for government assistance is another option, you may be waiting a while for it to kick in if you even qualify.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What’s your best bet, then? Completing short tasks online, as they don’t take a ton of time, you can usually complete them from the comfort of your couch, and you can earn that additional money you need.

If you’ve never heard of a short task before, it’s just as it sounds: A task that can be completed in very little time. And while that offers tons of flexibility, the fact that you can earn money without needing experience may be even better.

As an aside, short tasks are also referred to as mini tasks, micro jobs, and pay-per-task jobs. Keep that in mind when looking for sites to sign up for on your own.
<h4>Short Task Websites</h4>
The list of short task websites is massive. That alone can be overwhelming, however, so we’ve narrowed down the list to share some of the best sites you can work for. As you gain experience and get comfortable completing short tasks for cash, you can add more to your own list and grow your income.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Mechanical Turk from Amazon</h4>
When you think of Amazon, you probably see it as a company that likes to take your money when you buy products off its website. And while that may be Amazon’s claim to fame, the online giant also offers ways for people to make money.

Amazon Mechanical Turk features a ton of short tasks that you can tackle head-on. Once you complete enough of them, you can earn your choice of an Amazon gift card or cash.

Don’t let the “Mechanical Turk” name fool you, either. Although it may sound technical, there are plenty of simple tasks on the site that almost anyone can complete. For example, you could make sure that search results are accurate. You could be tasked with finding fields in large documents. Does a business have up-to-date contact information? That’s another task that may be available. And you could also do something as simple as picking out the perfect picture for a product.
<h4>i-Say</h4>
Here’s an example of a very simple short task website you may want to use to get your feet wet. If you can give your opinion to complete surveys, you can earn compensation on i-Say.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

<h4>Shopkick</h4>
If you love shopping, Shopkick may be more up your alley. Its list of micro jobs and mini tasks includes visiting online stores, walking into brick and mortar stores, looking at online products, and more. Complete enough of those tasks, and you can get gift cards to Target, Walmart, etc., which are just as good as cash since you probably shop there already.","Have you ever heard of short tasks?

What did you do the last time you needed a loan? Maybe it was for a car repair. Or maybe you needed to pay your landlord or light bill. Regardless of the case, you may have taken the payday loan route if friends and family couldn’t help. And if it was a traditional payday loan, you probably regret it. Why? Because payday loans can carry interest rates of up to 400 percent, making that loan a lot more costly than it should be.

If you paid dearly for a payday loan in the past, don’t fret. It’s estimated that over 12 million people have done the same, and this is why: First, they needed cash in a pinch. And second, they had bad credit.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

When you need cash fast, you can’t always be choosy. And when your credit is poor, and no lender wants to work with you, a payday loan may be as good as it gets.

Here’s the good news, though: You don’t need to rely on payday loans anymore, as there’s another option from Possible Finance that can save the day. Let’s take a look at this option in further detail now.
<h4>$500 Installment Loans From Possible Finance</h4>
Your landlord is ringing your phone off the hook, saying you better pay at least a portion of your rent by the end of the week. If not, they threaten to put you on the street. Friends and family can’t help, as they have financial issues of their own. Payday loans aren’t an option either, as there’s no way you’re paying 400 percent interest just to get your landlord off your back for a bit. Enter the installment loan from Possible Finance.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

By visiting that link above, you can enter your phone number to get a link. That link will let you download the Possible Finance app, which will let you apply for a $500 loan from your phone.

What can such an installment loan do for you?:
<ol>
 	<li>Give you up to $500 in a matter of minutes for whatever emergency you need to take care of.</li>
 	<li>Eliminate the need for good credit, as even applicants with bad credit or no credit, can get approved.</li>
 	<li>Give you more time to pay the loan back, as you can get two months to do so versus having to pay back the loan with your next paycheck.</li>
 	<li>Build your credit as long as you make payments on time.</li>
</ol>
As you can see, a Possible Finance installment loan can help you overcome the obstacle of having bad or no credit. But even better, it can help you build your credit, so you don’t run into similar issues in the future.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Before you take the next step and visit Possible Finance to apply for the $500 loan, remember this: It is a loan. Just like with any other loan, there are fees and interest involved.

Read the fine print before making anything final, so you know exactly what you’re getting into. For peace of mind, contact the Possible Finance team and ask them any questions you may have so you can make the most informed decision possible.","Here’s how to use your phone to get it within minutes, even if you have bad credit.","2021-10-01 00:09:52",post,https://spaoa.org/need-a-500-loan-get-it-through-your-phone/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1919085140.jpg,shutterstock_1919085140.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1919085140.jpg,3238,"The,Girl,With,The,Phone,Rejoices,At,Her,Profit.,Asian",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1919085140.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,need-a-500-loan-get-it-through-your-phone,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:17:02"

Now you can get quick cash regardless of your credit, and you can even build your credit to fix your finances with one simple solution.

What are payday loans famous for? Besides being a last-ditch option for quick cash when you’re in a pinch, they’re known as being a form of predatory lending. Why? Because they can hit you with 400 percent interest rates that can put you in an even worse financial bind than before, making them less than ideal options when you need a loan.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

What would possess someone to get a loan when it’s famous for being incredibly expensive and not worth the trouble? Having a poor credit history since most lenders run credit checks before approving a loan.

Does this mean that if you have no credit or bad credit that you’re doomed to use payday loans in the future? No, as there’s another type of loan that can fit your needs, and we’ll take a closer look at it now.
<h4>The Advantages of an Installment Loan Over a Payday Loan</h4>
If you’ve never heard of an installment loan before, now’s the time to get acquainted with it, as it could get you the cash you need minus the 400 percent interest rates from its payday counterpart.

For this article, we’ll discuss the features of an installment loan from Possible Finance.
This online lender has an app that you can download to your phone and use to apply for an installment loan. If all goes well, you could end up with a $500 loan to pay some bills, buy food, get your car repaired, etc.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

While bad credit is usually an obstacle that can limit you to a pricy payday loan, it’s not an issue with a Possible Finance installment loan, as they won’t check your credit. What will they check? Your driver’s license, Social Security number, and checking account to ensure you have some sort of income to repay the loan.

How is an installment loan better than a payday loan? First, the application process is simple, and you could get approved in minutes and have the cash you need to take care of an emergency. Second, repaying an installment loan from Possible Finance is easier and less stressful. Instead of having to repay the entire loan with your next paycheck, as a payday loan would require, you can pay everything back within two months. Even better, you have two weeks to make your first loan payment, but you can extend that to a month if you need extra time.

Third, a Possible Finance installment loan can build your credit. Since the loan repayment is spread out over two months and your payments are reported to the credit bureaus, you get the opportunity to increase your credit score. If successful, your higher credit score can lead to better loans and credit cards in the future to increase your spending power and decrease your interest expenses.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Does an installment loan have any drawbacks? Compared to more traditional loans, it can have higher interest rates. For this reason, use an installment loan from Possible Finance only for an actual emergency. And as always, before signing on the dotted line, make sure you’re clear about any fees, interest, and rules pertaining to your installment loan.","The days of applying for a pricy payday loan are over.

3243,"3 Simple Tips To Spend Less Each Month","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You have two primary choices when it comes to making your money last longer: First, you can find ways to make more income. And second, you can cut back on your spending.

We won’t focus on ways to increase income in this article. But we will show you how easy it is to cut back on spending without making any real sacrifices.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Don’t pay bills over the phone.</h4>
Here’s a common scenario that can cost you a few bucks: Your cable bill slipped through the cracks in your car or was sitting under a stack of magazines in your home. You find it one day before it’s due. To avoid late fees, you call the number on the bill and speak to a customer service agent. And to pay the bill on time, you give them your card info.

If Spectrum Cable was your company, that move could have cost you $5, as that’s what they charge to customers who pay one of their agents over the phone. Similarly, Verizon Wireless charges $7 to take your payment by phone, which is why you should pay online, in person, via automated phone service, or by sending in a check.
<h4>2. Turn off autopay.</h4>
While paying bills to a person over the phone can increase your costs, so can autopay, although in a different way. Studies show that people who use autopay tend to pay up to six percent more on their bills. Why? Because when your money is withdrawn automatically to pay a bill, it can keep you from looking at the bill itself.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

Let’s look at how this can lead to an issue with your utility bill. If it’s on autopay and you don’t look at your monthly usage, you may not see that you’re using way too much water or electricity each month. Without that knowledge, you won’t be able to cut back on usage, and you’ll continue paying more than you should.
Also, companies sometimes overcharge or charge you for services you don’t receive. Without looking at the bill, you won’t notice these errors, which is why autopay is best turned off.
<h4>3. Use your phone to order takeout.</h4>
Do you use an app or a restaurant’s website to order food for takeout or delivery? While those methods may be convenient, they can lead to more expensive bills.

Just think of the last time you ordered food online. You were probably hit with pop-ups on your way to checkout asking if you want to add dessert or take advantage of a deal. If you’re like most, you made those impulse purchases, which made your bill grow. That’s why you’re better off calling the restaurant and placing your order over the phone, as you can skip such temptation.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

One survey found that by placing your order by phone, you can save up to $10. If you order takeout or delivery frequently, that $10 savings each time can add up to a significant sum at the end of the year.","Here are some money-saving methods that you may be missing.","2021-10-01 00:01:33",post,https://spaoa.org/3-simple-tips-to-spend-less-each-month/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1898459227.jpg,shutterstock_1898459227.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1898459227.jpg,3244,"Stressed,,Problem,Business,Person,Man,,Male,Holding,And,Open,An",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_1898459227.jpg,Resources,"Savings And Loans",publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,3-simple-tips-to-spend-less-each-month,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:19:02"

If so, we’ll do our best to show you some of the different paths you can take to earning that work-at-home income.

Many people found themselves working from home recently because their offices closed. Others, meanwhile, want to start doing it to save time and money on transportation, earn unlimited income, spend more time with their kids, and so on.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

Even if you’ve never worked from home, there’s excellent news: You can break into this exciting world without any experience. And as we’re about to show you, there are many different ways to earn cash without having to sit in an office all day long.
<h3>Work-From-Home Ideas for Beginners</h3>
<h4>Become a Driver</h4>
If you have a car that’s in decent shape and you want to start making money now, becoming a driver may be your best bet. Luckily, there are several avenues you can take here. Demand appears to be high, too, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic changed many people’s lifestyles.

For starters, you can drive for Lyft or Uber. If the thought of having strangers in your car isn’t tempting, you can deliver food by working for Uber Eats or DoorDash.

If you don’t want to stink up your car with freshly cooked food from restaurants, you can shop for it at grocery stores by working for Instacart. And if you want to avoid food altogether, working for Postmates may be up your alley.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>Work as a Virtual Assistant</h4>
If the thought of working from your couch handling other people’s daily tasks sounds appealing, become a virtual assistant.

The pay is pretty decent, as it averages around $9 to $15 per hour. As for what a typical day as a virtual assistant could look like, picture yourself scheduling appointments, taking calls, answering emails, etc.
<h4>Sell Your Own Crafts</h4>
If you have a knack for making beautiful arts and crafts, you can convert that creativity into income. A site like Etsy.com is the perfect platform for putting your work on display, and it gets tons of traffic that could lead to a plethora of buyers willing to pay you a pretty penny for custom items.
<h4>Become a Freelancer</h4>
Do you have a particular skill? Do you want the ability to turn that special skill into unlimited income? If so, becoming a freelancer may be your ideal work-at-home job, and there are so many ways to do so.

If you see that there’s demand for something you do well, such as writing, translating, proofreading, etc., make a profile to attract paying clients. The growth potential here is fantastic, and you could easily make more freelancing than you ever have at a regular job.

If so, keep reading, as we’ll show you just how easy it can be to finance your education without paying out of pocket.

It’s easy to get motivated about going to school to get your degree and improve your financial future. But as you start to research the costs, you may wonder how you’ll ever pay for it all.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

The good news is that you may not have to pay a thing, as there are many forms of financial aid that can help. What does it take to get that much-needed aid so you can study without constantly worrying about money? We’ll jump into that now.
<h4>1. Know that money is out there.</h4>
How much money is there for school? So much that it’s estimated that students leave $2 billion in unclaimed federal grants on the table.
<h4>2. Know that you can qualify.</h4>
$2 billion is a ton of free money to leave unclaimed, so why does it happen? While there are several reasons why so much unclaimed federal grant money exists, this probably tops the list: Many students think they won’t qualify.

Pell Grants are one example of federal student aid based on financial need. However, they aren’t the only form of aid, which is why you shouldn’t assume that your income will leave you out in the cold.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!-- Resources -->

<h4>3. Make your FAFSA a priority.</h4>
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can be your gateway to all the money you’ll need for college. Not only does it determine financial need for funding like Pell Grants, but it can also help you get cash for college from merit-based scholarships and other opportunities from federal, state, and institutional resources.

In short, filling out your FAFSA can kill several birds with one stone, which is why it should be at the top of your college to-do list.
<h4>4. Prep for the FAFSA.</h4>
The longer it takes to submit your FAFSA, the more chances you’ll miss out on aid that’s first-come, first-served, such as Pell Grants. The FAFSA is free and relatively simple to complete, so don’t procrastinate when tackling this task. And if you feel overwhelmed, ask your school’s financial aid office for help with not just the FAFSA, but other ways to find college cash as well.

As for what it takes to complete the FAFSA, you’ll need to have the following ready:
<ul>
 	<li>Driver’s license number</li>
 	<li>Social Security number</li>
 	<li>Tax info to show your income</li>
 	<li>Alien registration card if you’re an eligible non-citizen</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

First, you’ll need to create a Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID). That will give you the ability to electronically sign your FAFSA and make it official. Once you have that ID, you can then proceed to complete the FAFSA.
<h4>5. Renew your FAFSA annually.</h4>
To ensure you get the most financial aid possible, you’ll need to complete a new FAFSA each year. While it may take a bit of work, it’s well worth it, especially if your income drops, as that can result in more financial aid for the new year.","Are you overcomplicating things when it comes to finding grants and scholarships for school?","2021-09-09 22:24:58",post,https://spaoa.org/these-basics-make-it-easy-to-find-money-for-school/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_149471900.jpg,shutterstock_149471900.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_149471900.jpg,3265,"Graduation,Cap,And,Money,On,A,Diploma",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_149471900.jpg,Resources,Education,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,these-basics-make-it-easy-to-find-money-for-school,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-09-09 22:24:58"

As if the pandemic wasn’t bad enough, it looks like extra unemployment benefits could be coming to an end.

Did you lose your job as a result of the coronavirus pandemic? If so, you’re certainly not alone, as many people not only lost their jobs, but remain unemployed.

The American Rescue Plan helped extend unemployment benefits with an extra $300 per week. Unfortunately, some states put an end to that prematurely, and September 6 is when the benefits are supposed to cease officially.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AdSense -->

This can obviously cause worry if you’ve been using that extra cash to survive. There are things you can do to stay afloat, though, such as these:
<h4>Look For Ways to Make Quick Income</h4>
The bad news is that those extra unemployment benefits are disappearing, unless they get extended once again. The good news is that there is plenty of work out there, and much of it pays more than it ever did before.

You have two main options when it comes to bringing in quick income. First, you can get a bridge job in an industry that hires quickly. As you can imagine, a bridge job is something you take in between that may not fit all of your requirements, but it does bring in much-needed cash.

For example, you could get a job waiting tables, even though that’s not what you usually do. There are tons of restaurants hiring, and many are now paying higher wages than ever. Some even offer sign-up bonuses, which could make such a job worth your while. Best of all, you can probably start immediately.

The second income-earning option is to start some side hustles. They don’t require the commitment of a job, but can bring in fast income to buy food and pay the bills. While the list of side hustles is never-ending, some examples include driving for Uber, babysitting or pet sitting, or delivering food via services like DoorDash or Uber Eats.
<h4>Try to Get Unemployment From Your State</h4>
It may not be a lot, but unemployment benefits from your state could still help a bit. To ensure you can continue receiving the basic benefits, contact your state’s unemployment office now.
<h4>Call 211</h4>
A quick phone call to 211 can result in a ton of assistance. They have operators who are experts in linking people in need with assistance in their area, and they can do the same for you.

For starters, ask about housing assistance. Since Congress allocated $47 billion for rental assistance, the money is out there. The only problem is that it’s split amongst 340 agencies, so getting your hands on it can be complicated. With 211, they’ll point you in the right direction so you can get rental assistance quickly.

[the_ad id='2456']<!-- Media.net -->

Is housing the only thing 211 specializes in? No, as they can also help with food assistance by sending you to local food pantries to meet your nutritional needs in the short term. For long-term food assistance, applying for food stamps (SNAP) is your best bet.","While challenging, these simple tips can help you push through.

3272,"How To Find Hotel Vouchers For The Homeless","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

Luckily, hotel vouchers for the homeless can offer some temporary lodging until you get back on your feet.

Homelessness has been an issue for some time, but it’s in danger of getting worse. Families that once lived without a worry in the world are now finding themselves homeless and living on the streets, which can force them to move into shelters that are less than ideal.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

What’s an option if you don’t want to live in a homeless shelter? Hotel or motel vouchers. We’ll discuss what they are and where you can find them to get some much-needed peace of mind.
<h4>How Homeless Hotel Vouchers Work</h4>
As you can probably guess, a homeless hotel voucher allows you to stay in a hotel or motel without having to pay for it. This is excellent news if you're homeless, as such lodging can be pretty expensive and out of reach if you don’t have any savings or income.

Can a motel or hotel voucher get you some good nights’ sleep? Absolutely, but they come with one problem: They’re very temporary. Unlike shelters that can give you a bit of stability until you get housing of your own, hotel vouchers typically last a few nights at the most. In other words, don’t expect to get motel vouchers for an entire month. Instead, you’re looking at about three nights maximum before you have to find another place to sleep.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

If you’re wondering why a motel or hotel would allow for such an arrangement, it’s because referral agencies usually handle vouchers. While the agencies get to help the homeless get some rest in a safe location, the businesses get paid. It’s worth noting that there may be occasions when you can pick which hotel or motel you sleep at, but the referral agency is usually in charge.
<h4>The Advantage of Hotel Vouchers Over Homeless Shelters</h4>
Do homeless shelters play a significant role in getting people off of the streets? Absolutely, but they’re not the ideal setting for everyone. If you have a family with young kids or have never been homeless before, a shelter may be a daunting place to be due to several factors. There can be problematic residents, alcohol and drug abuse, theft, and sanitation issues that may make you prefer the streets versus a shelter. This is why finding hotel vouchers may be your best bet, at least for the time being.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>Where to Find Motel Vouchers for the Homeless</h4>
You’ll likely have to do a bit of legwork to find a hotel voucher, as they’re often limited and in high demand. Here are some places where homeless people tend to have success in finding motel vouchers:
<ul>
 	<li>Call 211 – They can tell you who offers hotel vouchers in your area.</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army – They may have homeless shelters and contacts for hotel vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Local Homeless Shelters – Even if you don’t want to stay there, ask a staff member if they offer motel vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Catholic Charities – Contact your nearest branch and ask if they offer homeless motel vouchers.</li>
 	<li>Regional Assistance Programs – Some cities, counties, and states have homeless programs that may provide hotel vouchers. Do an online search for homeless hotel vouchers in your area, or ask the 211 operator for assistance.</li>

3275,"5 Costly Plumbing Problems You Can Fix For Free","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

Just follow these quick tips, and you can fix them for free.

Why do many “experts” suggest you build an emergency fund? So you don’t whip out your credit card and go into deep debt when emergencies appear. While medical issues pop into our heads when thinking of building such a “rainy day” fund, here’s a costly unexpected problem that often gets overlooked: Plumbing issues.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

Before you laugh, know that the average plumbing fix costs $450. And even if you have nothing more than a clogged toilet, that can hit your pockets hard just to have the plumber come out there, especially if it’s after hours or on the weekends.

Unless you have a plumber in the household, common issues can mess up your monthly budget. But here are some easy fixes you can do on your own that will barely cost you a thing in terms of time or money:
<h4>1. How to Unclog a Toilet</h4>
Other than a burst pipe, perhaps the worst plumbing problem you can have is a clogged toilet. Not only is a usable toilet a necessity, but having it clogged can be so gross that you want it fixed immediately.

Well, before you call the plumber or even grab a plunger or snake tool, grab this instead: Dish soap. Why? Because it acts like a lubricant that can unclog a toilet with ease.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

The next time your toilet gets clogged, squirt ½ cup of dish soap into it. Then slowly dump a bucket of hot water and let the toilet sit untouched for 20 minutes. After the water level drops, add another bucket of hot water. Then flush it to finish off the problem.
<h4>2. How to Fix a Stinky Garbage Disposal</h4>
When it smells like something died in your garbage disposal, don’t automatically believe that it's broken. It probably just has some food stuck in there, which you can clear out to eliminate the smell by doing this: Putting a handful of ice cubes in there.

With the ice cubes in the disposal, turn it on. The ice will get crushed and act as a brush to clean up the disposal and make it odor-free.
<h4>3. How to Increase Your Showerhead’s Water Pressure</h4>
If water is slowly trickling out of your showerhead, it may be clogged with minerals. To unclog it, fill a Zip-loc bag with white vinegar. Tie the bag around the showerhead with some rubber bands, making sure that it’s soaked in the vinegar. Let it sit overnight, and your showerhead should get unclogged so water can flow freely.
<h4>4. How to Unclog Your Kitchen Pipes</h4>
Your kitchen sink may have collected grease and fat from when you wash the dishes, causing a clog. You can unclog it by pouring hot (not boiling) water down the sink to melt all of that gunk. Do this once a week as preventative maintenance.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>5. How to Unclog Your Bathtub</h4>
This tip may be the most fun of all, as it creates a small volcano in your bathtub from the chemical reaction. When your bathtub is clogged, pour a mixture of ½ cup baking soda and warm water from a bowl into the drain. Let it sit for five minutes, then add one cup of white vinegar down the drain. You should see a lot of fizzing, and after 10 minutes, you can run water to watch it magically go down the unclogged drain with ease.","You don’t need to be a professional plumber to fix these five plumbing problems.","2021-09-29 21:45:23",post,https://spaoa.org/5-costly-plumbing-problems-you-can-fix-for-free/,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_694084111.jpg,shutterstock_694084111.jpg,/chroot/home/ac321589/spaoa.org/html/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_694084111.jpg,3276,"Confused,Guy,Holding,A,Plunger,And,Looking,At,The,Camera",,,,https://spaoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutterstock_694084111.jpg,Resources,,publish,1,spaoa_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Roxanne,,5-costly-plumbing-problems-you-can-fix-for-free,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-10-20 14:19:08"
3295,"A Crash Course In Section 8 Housing Vouchers","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

This quick crash course will get you up to speed so you can apply for a Housing Choice Voucher today.

If you’ve never received rental assistance before, the thought of figuring out what Section 8 is and how to apply for it may be intimidating. There’s no need to fear, though, as we’ll do our best to make it as simple as possible, so you know how housing vouchers work and what to do to get them.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>What’s the Purpose of a Housing Choice Voucher?</h4>
Have you ever used a coupon in the grocery store to make an item cheaper? You probably have.

The coupon paid a portion of the item’s price, and once applied at the register, you had to pay the rest to make that item yours.

A Housing Choice Voucher works similarly. The government uses a coupon (the voucher), gives it directly to your landlord each month, and whatever is leftover in rent is your responsibility.

What does this do? It makes rent more affordable so you can pay your bills each month and keep a roof over your family’s head.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

<h4>What’s Needed to Get a Voucher?</h4>
Unfortunately, a housing voucher differs from coupons you find in your local newspaper in one significant way: Not everyone can get one.

Vouchers are based on need. The government came up with the Housing Choice Voucher Program to help people making minimal income, or those who are elderly or disabled.

Eligibility for Section 8 vouchers is determined during the application process where different factors are considered, such as your household’s income, citizenship, and size.

Your local public housing agency (PHA) will use these bits of data to see if you qualify. Competition for vouchers is fierce since so many low-income households need help. Three out of four vouchers per PHA will go to families making under 30 percent of the area median income.
<h4>Where Can You Live With a Voucher?</h4>
Should you be selected for Section 8, you will have to find a property that accepts payment from the program. The property will also have to meet Section 8 standards to ensure it’s safe.

There’s a belief that a voucher limits you to living in specific subsidized project housing. That’s not true, as you can pick from a variety of housing options, such as apartments, single-family homes, and townhouses. Provided they participate in Section 8 and meet the program’s requirements, you can move in with your voucher.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>How Do You Get Started?</h4>
Since your PHA will handle your housing voucher application, the best place to get started is with them. You can find your PHA by going <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.

Don’t wait too long to begin the application process. Getting a Section 8 voucher can make a huge difference in your monthly budget, and, as mentioned, the competition is fierce.

Some waiting lists can be quite long, so the quicker you contact your PHA and begin, the better off you’ll be.","There’s no need to spend hours researching Section 8 housing assistance to figure out how it can help you pay the rent each month.

Can you put a roof over your head if you have a felony in your past? Believe it or not, you can. Will you have as many housing options as someone with a squeaky clean record? No, but there are ways to find felon-friendly apartments, and we’ll discuss them now.
<h3>Searching for Felon-Friendly Apartments Online</h3>
If you’re finally ready to get back into society, you’re probably pretty anxious about finding an apartment. You can ease this anxiety almost immediately by searching for felony-friendly housing online.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

Here are some of the best sites for doing so:
<ul>
 	<li>Craigslist</li>
 	<li>Zillow</li>
 	<li>Yelp</li>
 	<li>Zumper</li>
 	<li>Trovit</li>
</ul>
When searching these sites, try to enter in phrases like:
<ul>
 	<li>No background check</li>
 	<li>Felon-friendly</li>
 	<li>Felony-friendly</li>
 	<li>No credit check</li>
</ul>
If you get any hits on those phrases, you can instantly narrow the field to find a landlord who might be willing to take you in, regardless of your record.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

<h3>Tips to Follow During Your Search</h3>
As mentioned, you’ll have fewer options since you’ll be searching for places that don’t require background checks. Keeping this in mind, here are some tips that can lead to better results:
<h4>1. Try to avoid management companies.</h4>
A company that manages several properties is more likely to have stricter rules that include background checks. On the other hand, a private landlord may not be so rigid and may simply want someone to pay the rent on time.

You’re more likely to find a landlord-run property by searching for duplexes or apartments located in single-family homes. If the property is in a massive apartment complex or a building, it is probably run by a management company that’s only looking for tenants with good credit and clean records.

Could you apply to a management company? Sure, but applications may take a long time to complete and process, and they’re more likely to reject you than a private landlord.
<h4>2. Look for properties in low demand.</h4>
You may want to drop your standards a bit until you can get back on your feet. This means looking for rentals of properties in lower demand, such as single rooms or basements.

A person renting out a single room or basement may not require a background check. As long as you have the money to pay, you may be good to go, felony or not.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

Some websites allow you to search for such options. Instead of solely searching for apartments, see if the site lets you search for rooms, shared housing, temporary housing, or sublets. All could lead to success without the hassle of a lengthy application or background check.

Speaking of applications, another tip worth mentioning is to read yours before filling it out. If it says a credit check or background check is required, move on to the next one.
<h4>3. Look outside of cities.</h4>
A big city often comes with more expensive rent. Look for towns in the vicinity that may be cheaper and have less demand. This could lead to a landlord who is willing to accept felons and doesn’t require background checks.

Although extending your search can help you find a felon-friendly apartment, don’t forget about transportation costs. You don’t want to live too far away from your job if it’s going to cost you too much time and money just to get there every day.","Contrary to popular belief, you can rent an apartment if you have a felony on your record.

3301,"See How The Government Can Make Home Buying More Affordable","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

Do you look at your monthly rent payments as burning money? Are you sick of investing your hard-earned money in your landlord’s mortgage? Would you like to have a home you can finally call your own?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, here’s some excellent news: You can become a homeowner even if you don’t have a ton of savings or make a lot of money, as the government has a few programs that could be right up your alley:

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

<h4>The Homeownership Voucher Program</h4>
If you’re familiar with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), you probably know about Section 8. Formerly called the Housing Choice Voucher Program, Section 8 pays a portion of your monthly rent directly to the landlord. This makes rent much more affordable so you can save for other expenses.

While Housing Choice Vouchers are ideal for renters, the HUD also has the <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv/homeownership"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Homeownership Voucher Program</a>. Who is it ideal for? You guessed it – people looking to own a home.

If you qualify for a Homeownership Voucher from the HUD, you can make your dream of owning a home a reality, no matter if your income is low or if you currently reside in public housing. With the voucher helping with housing expenses or your mortgage, you can begin living in a home that’s yours instead of your landlord’s.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

<h4>FHA Loans</h4>
The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) handles <a href=""https://www.hud.gov/buying/loans"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this program</a> that makes homeownership more accessible, even for those struggling financially. It achieves this goal by offering loans that don’t feature strict requirements that keep many people from getting a mortgage.

What keeps mortgage approval out of the reach of many? A solid credit history, as many home loan providers want borrowers to have high credit scores. Beyond that, aspiring homeowners usually need significant savings for a down payment as well as closing costs.

With an FHA loan, you don’t need to worry about having a high credit score. You can make a down payment of just 3.5 percent of the purchase price of the home. And you can also look forward to lower closing costs. All of the above make owning a home a lot easier.
<h4>HUD Homes</h4>
Have you looked at the price of homes out of curiosity, only to be shocked at how high they are? This alone can keep you from looking into homeownership any further. With a HUD home or HUD real estate owned (REO) property, however, you can find a steal at a much more affordable price.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

Since the HUD is in charge of the FHA loan program, they sometimes take over homes when owners can’t pay their mortgages. Once they do this, they open up a world of opportunity for people looking to own homes that aren’t set at ridiculously high prices. As a bonus, you could also get low down payments and closing cost assistance when buying a HUD home.

You can look for HUD homes online by <a href=""https://www.hudhomestore.com/Home/Index.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">using this tool</a>.","Before you give up on your dream of buying a home, know that it could be a lot more accessible than you think.

3304,"A Pre-Application Checklist For Section 8 Housing","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll help you prep for it, so you don’t end up wasting a ton of time.

You may have always paid your rent on time, until the events of the past year popped up. Losing your job or seeing a drop in income may have made it hard to pay your landlord, which made you think: Is there a way to reduce my rent?

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

In actuality, there are several ways to reduce your rent. Some of the more common methods include moving to a smaller home, relocating to a less expensive city, getting a roommate, or moving in with friends and family. But what if none of those options appeal to you?

If that’s the case, here’s another way to reduce your rent: Get a Housing Choice Voucher from the government’s Section 8 program. With it, you’ll only have to pay about 30 percent of your income towards the rent. The government will pay the rest via your voucher. And in the end, this can result in significant savings so you can gain housing stability and reduce stress.

Unfortunately, everyone can’t receive Section 8 housing assistance. It’s limited not only to low-income households, but also in its funding. There are many people seeking to make rent more affordable through Section 8, making the competition fierce. And since you could spend a year or more on a waiting list for your voucher, you’ll want to pre-screen yourself to ensure you have a chance of getting approved.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

Before you apply for Section 8 and commence the potentially long waiting process, consider the following:

<h4>1. Do you meet immigration status requirements?</h4>
To qualify for Section 8, at least one person in the household must have legal immigration status. What happens if other household members don’t have it? They won’t be counted when it comes to how much you’ll get for your voucher.

If at least you have legal immigration status, you should be good to go here.

<h4>2. Do you have a criminal history?</h4>
If there’s one thing that can keep you from getting approved for Section 8, it’s a criminal history.
This doesn’t mean you’ll be automatically disqualified if you have a record, as some felons or people on parole still get accepted. However, if the following apply, you may find it impossible to get a Section 8 voucher:

<ul>
 	<li>Eviction for drug problems within the last three years.</li>
 	<li>Being listed on the lifelong sex offender registry.</li>
 	<li>Conviction for methamphetamine production in federal housing.</li>
</ul>

Each Public Housing Agency differs in how they deal with criminal history. Contact yours to see if you can make it regardless of your past.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>3. Is your income low enough?</h4>
Since Section 8 is meant to help low-income households, you’ll have to make below a certain amount for your area. You can see income limits <a href=""https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to get a better idea of where you stand.

<h4>4. Have you picked a location?</h4>
You don’t have to live in your current city. You can use your Section 8 voucher to move somewhere else. Research places where you’d like to live, then contact PHAs in those areas to see how you can start the application process.","It can take quite a while to get a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher.

3307,"Where To Find Free Or Affordable Internet","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

We’ll reveal where free government Wi-Fi will soon be available, as well as existing alternative programs that don’t cost a pretty penny.
<h4>Free Internet From the Government</h4>
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant shift towards Internet usage at home. Many students began learning virtually instead of in classrooms, and workers began to work from home as offices shuttered.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

In addition to this shift, many people lost their jobs and income, leaving them with little money to afford Internet service. As such, the FCC recently announced its Emergency Broadband Benefit program to make the Internet more affordable.

If eligible for this benefit, you could receive $50 to $75 per month towards your Internet bill. In other words, you could end up paying nothing for Internet service, which would free up some room in your budget and allow you the online access necessary to study or work from home. Beyond that monthly benefit, this free government Wi-Fi program would also offer $100 to help you buy a computer.

As you can imagine, free Internet and money towards the purchase of a computer could help dramatically. Unfortunately, the Emergency Broadband Benefit isn’t live as of yet, so stay tuned, as it should be available soon.

Who will be eligible for this free Internet program from the government? Households that:
<ul>
 	<li>Qualify for Lifeline.</li>
 	<li>Have a child who receives reduced-price or free school breakfasts or lunches.</li>
 	<li>Have a student who won a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year.</li>
 	<li>Experienced extreme economic loss during the pandemic and make less than $99,000 for single or $198,000 for joint filers.</li>
 	<li>Qualify for low-income Internet service from participating providers.</li>
 	<li>Qualify for COVID-19 Internet programs.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

<h4>Low-Income Internet Programs</h4>
These programs may not offer free Internet like the Emergency Broadband Benefit, but they could get you online for as little as $5 per month.
<h4>Access from AT&amp;T</h4>

Keep reading, and you’ll breathe a sigh of relief as you see how the government can offer financial assistance.

With unemployment benefits from your state, you can fill the gap from lost income until you find another job.

Pregnant women or single moms with kids under five can buy infant formula, baby food, milk, and other nutritional staples through this program.

3315,"4 Tips To Get Free Or Cheap Netflix","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

Try these tips to get it for free or at a lower cost so you can enjoy its massive catalog of content.

Besides keeping you entertained, subscribing to a service like Netflix can save you money.
How? By keeping you on your couch, so you don’t spend a ton of cash eating out, going to the movies, etc. And in times of a pandemic, having a Netflix subscription can also keep you safe and occupied if stuck inside.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

What’s the problem some have with Netflix? It’s ever-increasing costs as it aims to grow its catalog of shows and movies. Does this mean you should look elsewhere for entertainment? You could. But we’re about to show you ways to make Netflix cheaper or even free.
<h4>1. Sign up for a free trial.</h4>
Netflix started as a DVD rental service. And while its streaming service gets all the publicity nowadays, those rentals are still going strong.

If you’ve never tried renting DVDs from Netflix, now’s the time to start via a free trial. For 30 days, you can rent unlimited DVDs that will be delivered to your door at no cost. You won’t have to worry about late fees either.

This is one way to get free entertainment for a month, provided you cancel the trial before those 30 days hit. And one benefit of the DVD rental service is that it offers a better selection than the streaming, especially as far as new movie releases go.

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

That takes care of DVD rentals. What about streaming? Unfortunately, free trials for Netflix streaming disappeared last year, so you’ll be stuck with the DVD trial for now.
<h4>2. Share a login.</h4>
Chances are, you have friends or family members with a Netflix subscription. Ask for their login credentials, and it may give you a way to enjoy Netflix for free.

Even if you’re asked to pay your share of the subscription, this is a great way to get Netflix on the cheap. Just be sure that the plan you’re sharing allows you to watch on multiple screens simultaneously.
<h4>3. Get a new cell phone or Internet plan.</h4>
Cell phone and Internet providers have tons of competition, and one way they’re enticing new customers is by adding free Netflix to their plans.

T-Mobile is one example, as their “Netflix on Us” program offers free streaming with certain cell phone plans. You can check with your cell or Internet providers to see if they have something similar, or shop around and make the switch to get no-cost Netflix as a perk.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>4. Search for Netflix coupon codes.</h4>
If you have no luck getting free Netflix by trying the tips above, look for coupon codes online to make the streaming service more affordable.

You can search for Netflix coupon codes via sites like Coupons.com, RetailMeNot.com, or Slickdeals.net. Or you can simply enter the following into a search engine to see what comes up: “Netflix coupon codes.”","The price of Netflix keeps going up as the streaming service grows in popularity.

3318,"When Applying For Emergency Rental Assistance, Here’s The Info You’ll Need","[the_ad_group id=""153""]<!-- AD01 -->

If you plan on applying for such assistance right now, here’s what you’ll need to show your eligibility.

If you think all of the pandemic assistance has dried up because stimulus checks, extra unemployment benefits, and eviction moratoriums are gone, think again. The Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program from the U.S. Department of Treasury has billions in funding waiting to be distributed, but here’s the main problem: All of that money is split amongst 400-plus local programs. Even worse, many people don’t even know it exists, but now you do.

[the_ad id='2455']<!-- AD02 -->

What does it take to receive some of that ERA funding? You’ll have to show a financial need and that you’re having difficulty paying your landlord due to issues arising from the pandemic and all of the job and income loss it caused. Let’s dive deeper into how you can show that need so you can start getting emergency rent help soon.
<h3>Proving Eligibility for the ERA Program</h3>
There are four primary requirements you’ll have to meet to get emergency rental assistance due to the pandemic. While the requirements and the necessary proof will differ depending on your local program, here’s what you can probably expect when you start the ERA application process.
<h4>1. Showing your rental agreement.</h4>
To get emergency rental assistance, you have to prove that you paid rent in the first place. How can you do this? By having a signed rental agreement or a lease that shows where you live and how much you pay the landlord each month.

While you may think everyone has such paperwork, some people do not. If you’re one of them, there are other ways to show you have at least some type of rental agreement in place, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Check stubs that prove past rent payments.</li>
 	<li>Bank statements showing withdrawals or payments to your landlord.</li>
 	<li>Utility bills.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""152""]<!--  AD03 -->

If you have none of those pieces of proof, you may get by, depending on your local program, with a statement from your landlord. In some cases, a written statement from yourself may work, but you will be checked on every few months to verify that your situation has not changed and you still need rental assistance.
<h4>2. Showing your income below a certain level.</h4>
Income plays a significant part too. Your household’s income must sit below a certain level, which your local program will determine. You can prove income with tax returns, pay stubs, a letter from your employer, or unemployment benefits documents.

If you lack that documentation, you may be able to submit a written statement if you have a special situation. For example, if you’re disabled, lack access to technology, your employer is no longer in business, or you have zero income, that may allow you to provide a written statement.
<h4>3. Showing financial hardship.</h4>
Has one of your household members experienced financial hardship? That will be necessary to qualify, and you can prove it if you owe a large debt, lost income, have past due expenses, are eligible for unemployment, etc.

[the_ad id='2456']<!--  AD04 -->

<h4>4. Showing housing instability.</h4>
The last piece of the ERA qualifying puzzle is to demonstrate housing instability. If you’re living in unsafe or unhealthy conditions, are close to being evicted, or have past due rent, that could be enough to show housing instability so you can receive emergency rental assistance.

Now that you see what it takes to qualify for the ERA program, go here to find your local office so you can apply.","Emergency rental assistance could act as a lifeline while you try to fix your finances.
