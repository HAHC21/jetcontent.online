3480,"Long-Term Strategies To Ensure You Always Have Enough Cash Saved For Holiday Spending","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Follow these three long-term saving strategies, and you’ll do just that.

What happens to many people once the holiday season kicks into gear? They panic once they realize they don’t have enough saved.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If spending this season seems like it will be scarce, start making these moves now so you’ll have plenty of savings socked away for next year.
<h4>1. Set a monthly savings goal just for your holiday budget.</h4>
How much money do you usually spend for the holidays? You probably have a round figure or limit that you usually stick to. You can use this amount to set as your yearly savings goal, and then work backward by saving a certain percentage of your income each month.

For instance, let’s say you usually spend $1,200 each holiday season on gifts, food, and other items. To reach that goal, you’ll need to save $100 per month.

By saving a specific amount each month, it becomes easier to reach your goal at the end of the year. If you wait until it’s too late, you may have trouble stashing enough cash for year-end spending spree.

Provided you have the discipline to do it, you can withdraw your monthly savings goal and put it in a piggy bank or box under your bed. Otherwise, you can set up automatic transfers to a savings account or have your employer take a percentage of your paycheck. By having someone else do it for you, you’re more likely to stick to the goal.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Use holiday savings accounts.</h4>
There are specific accounts that work great for year-end savings. Credit unions usually have holiday savings accounts that lock whatever money you put into them until the end of the year. By lacking access to the funds, they’ll be there sitting safely when you need them.

Do you need to put a ton of cash into such accounts? Not at all. The point is to put something there, as just $50 per month will give you $600 to spend once the year is over.
<h4>3. Start a savings challenge.</h4>
Saving usually isn’t a fun activity, which is why framing it as a game makes it easier to do.

For instance, you could set up a 52-week savings challenge where you put aside money each week for the holidays.

If this sounds hard, remember that the goal is to get into the flow of saving without having to suffer. In other words, you don’t have to save a ton each week to meet the challenge’s requirements.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

To see this notion in action, try saving just $1 dollar for your first week. For the second week, save $2. The third week's savings should be $3, and so on. At the end of 52 weeks, you’ll surprisingly have $1,378 saved, which is a nice chunk of change to have for holiday spending.

Regardless of which method you use, saving for the entire year instead of rushing at the end can help you meet your goals. More importantly, it’ll show you the value of each dollar to give you a better perspective of how holiday purchases can affect your entire yearly budget. In doing so, you may be less tempted to spend so much.","Want to make sure you have enough to spend once each holiday season rolls around?","2020-09-25 09:16:06",post,https://holidayrelief.com/long-term-strategies-to-ensure-you-always-have-enough-cash-saved-for-holiday-spending/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-2.png,unnamed-2.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-2.png,3482,unnamed,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-2.png,Housing,,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,long-term-strategies-to-ensure-you-always-have-enough-cash-saved-for-holiday-spending,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-01 17:49:36"
3489,"What To Do Now If You Have No Money Saved For The Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

The holidays should be time for getting together with friends and family, but for many, spending overshadows this concept.

Is spending bad? Of course not, but it can be troublesome if you have income tied up in bills and other essential expenses.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

A lack of savings may make holiday spending more difficult, but it’s not impossible as long as you make the most of what you have. Here are a few ways to do so:
<h4>1. Think about the impact of holiday spending.</h4>
Yes, it feels great to see others smile as they open your gifts. Don’t let that swift satisfaction overshadow the financial impact those gifts have on you, however.

Overspending during the holidays can lead to stress throughout the year, especially if you rack up credit card debt. Remember this when setting your holiday budget. Doing so should put things into perspective so you can tame that itch to spend money that you don’t have.
<h4>2. Set your budget.</h4>
After looking at your situation, you may realize that you don’t have much saved. This lack of savings doesn’t mean the holidays will be a dud; it just means you’ll have to cut back.

Set a holiday budget of what you can realistically spend after all bills are paid and keep your priorities first. Don’t let the urge to buy gifts and food lead you into the trap of putting off bills until they’re late and hurt your credit.

As you make your budget, avoid panic if you realize there’s not much you can spend. Once again, think of the year-long financial impact holiday spending has. Once you do, setting a small budget won’t feel so bad.
<h4>3. Cut expenses to set aside holiday money.</h4>
Now might be the time to sacrifice a bit. To meet your holiday budget, you can cut certain expenses that aren’t necessary.

Eating out could be first on the list. Instead of hitting restaurants or the drive-thru, cook at home to save substantially.

Do you go to the movies a lot or shop as a hobby? Cut those expenses for the next couple of months so you can have some holiday cash.

Check all of your subscription services. Netflix, online subscriptions, and any other monthly expenses that you don’t need can be put on hold for the time being.
<h4>4. Make your gift list.</h4>
Hitting the mall without a list can lead to overspending, just as if you do it when going grocery shopping. To avoid costly impulse purchases or going over budget, make a list and stick to it.

You may have to get picky when deciding who you’ll buy gifts for, especially if you have a large family or many friends. Don’t let this stress you, and if necessary, let them know your situation this year so there’s no misunderstanding.

To alleviate the stress of gift-giving, you could suggest a get-together instead. Let everyone know it’s your way of enjoying each other’s company while trying to stay within your means.
<h4>5. Watch your food expenses.</h4>
Food should be included as part of your budget. If not, you’ll likely go over since it’s such a significant part of holiday spending.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While it is nice to indulge in holiday meals, don’t feel the need to overdo it. Cut back a bit this year, and nobody will really notice the difference.
<h4>6. Don’t wait for deals.</h4>
Black Friday and Cyber Monday do offer some attractive deals, but you can find discounts now without having to wait. By knowing prices now, you can also know later on if you’re really getting a deal or not.","If you find yourself panicking over a lack of savings, follow these tips to stretch your money this season.","2020-09-25 09:48:35",post,https://holidayrelief.com/what-to-do-now-if-you-have-no-money-saved-for-the-holidays/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-1.png,unnamed-1.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-1.png,3471,"unnamed (1)",,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-1.png,Housing,,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,what-to-do-now-if-you-have-no-money-saved-for-the-holidays,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-01 17:49:36"
3493,"Remember To Include These Overlooked Expenses In Your Holiday Budget","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Don’t forget to include these often overlooked expenses too.

The holidays are filled with fun, friends, and family. They’re also filled with expenses too, however, and it’s the unexpected ones you need to watch for. If you don’t, you could go over your budget, which could lead to you going into debt for many months (or years) to come.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are holiday expenses you should include in your budget besides the usual gifts:
<h4>Meals</h4>
What will you almost always find at a holiday get-together? Loads of food. Even a home-cooked family meal can pack quite the wallop on your wallet, which is why food expenses must be accounted for in your budget.

Alcohol costs during holiday parties can run up your receipts to amounts higher than you’re used to. To cut these costs and others related to food, ask guests to bring something to contribute and share in the expenses.

Also, when budgeting for meals and holiday food, don’t forget items such as decorations, utensils, and the like.

Although invitations to holiday dining may be hard to decline, try to avoid eating out as much as possible. Doing so is one of the easiest ways to adhere to a budget during the holidays.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Decorations</h4>
You probably have specific decorations you’ve saved over the years to make your home feel as holiday-like as possible. As you go shopping, however, you may run across new decorations that tempt your wallet.

While you don’t have to avoid buying new decorations, be sure to include some space for them in your budget. And if you need something different for your home, try getting your decorations from garage sales or online marketplaces.

You’d be surprised at how beautiful some secondhand decorations are. Combine their uniqueness with significant savings, and you may ditch retail stores for their décor.
<h4>Work Expenses</h4>
Your workplace may have a gift exchange where you’ll be expected to purchase something for a coworker. Include this in your budget, as well as any other gifts you’d like to give to your boss or other employees.
<h4>Holiday Cards</h4>
Do you like to go all out when it comes to cards? Hiring a professional photographer to snap pics of your family so you can send them to others can be quite pricey. Include card-related costs in your budget if this sounds like a yearly tradition you enjoy partaking in.
<h4>Travel</h4>
Many people forget to include travel in their holiday budget when it’s one of the most significant expenses around. Holiday travel can be extremely costly, so if you’re visiting someone far away, don’t forget to include it.

You can cut holiday travel costs by carpooling with others to share transportation expenses. Buying airline tickets well in advance can save you money as well.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Donations</h4>
Toy drives and giving to charities should always be part of your holiday budget if you do them yearly. If you find that there’s no room for them this year, you could donate your time to a worthy cause instead via volunteering.","Are gifts for friends and family the only thing listed in your holiday budget?","2020-09-25 10:19:01",post,https://holidayrelief.com/remember-to-include-these-overlooked-expenses-in-your-holiday-budget/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-1.png,pasted-image-0-1.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-1.png,3494,"pasted image 0 (1)",,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-1.png,Housing,,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,remember-to-include-these-overlooked-expenses-in-your-holiday-budget,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-01 17:49:36"
3496,"5 Tips To Keep Your Halloween Costs Down","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Follow these tips to keep those costs down so you can get the most bang for your buck on this fear-filled holiday.

When it comes to expensive holidays, Christmas and other year-end festivities tend to take the spotlight. Halloween, however, is usually overlooked.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What happens if you don’t watch your wallet on Halloween? You could have less cash saved for spending later on.

To keep that from happening, let’s look at ways to make October 31st as affordable as possible.
<h4>1. Decorate via discount stores.</h4>
Since Halloween tends to be a shorter holiday, spending so much on decorations isn’t really worth it.

Yes, those decorations you’ll find at big box retailers are boo-tiful. They can haunt your bank account, though, so opt for discount stores instead.

Dollar stores are loaded with cheap decorations that will keep your kids happy without breaking your budget. Walk in with just a handful of bucks, and you’ll be surprised at what you can get to make your house feel frightful.
<h4>2. Make your costumes.</h4>
Specialty Halloween stores will charge you a pretty penny for their costumes, primarily since they rely on one day a year for most of their earnings. Make your costumes out of items sitting and your home, and you can still look spooktacular for a fraction of the cost.

If you have a tough time getting inspired, look online for homemade costume ideas. Doing so will help you put something together in no time.

If a homemade costume is not an option, see what drug stores have in stock. They may have something much cheaper than a specialty store that still gets the job done.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Buy candy alternatives.</h4>
Chances are, most of your neighbors will be handing out fun-sized chocolate bars and other candy to the kids. You, on the other hand, can hand out similarly-priced alternatives to stand out from the crowd.

Spooky rings, stickers, and glow-in-the-dark bracelets will give trick-or-treaters some variety in their bags. Even better, you can keep any you don’t use for next year, which can lead to savings over candy you’d have to eat or toss out.

Oh, and if you’re not one to toss out candy and would rather eat it, think of those dental costs from cavities and other tooth issues. Those alone can rack up your Halloween-related bills.
<h4>4. Find free events.</h4>
Haunted houses, amusement parks, and other eerie events can be quite costly. Luckily, they aren’t the only Halloween events you’re likely to find, so look around for free alternatives.

Beyond trick-or-treating in your neighborhood, many local malls offer the same. Many stores also hold Halloween get-togethers, such as costume parties at The Disney Store and pumpkin-themed celebrations at Bass Pro Shops.

Do you have pets you’d like to include too? PetSmart has you covered there with trick-or-treating for dogs and costume contests.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>5. Don’t ditch your pumpkin.</h4>
Once it’s done serving as a jack-o'-lantern, use your pumpkin in other ways before putting it in the trash.

You can roast its seeds as a snack or make pumpkin puree for pasta. Turn the skin into crispy chips. You can even use its parts for a free face mask to avoid overpaying for beauty products.","Halloween costs can creep up on you if you’re not careful.

3498,"Easy Tips For Creating Your Holiday Budget","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Yes, making a budget may take some of the fun out of the holiday season, but it’s a necessity to stay as debt-free as possible.

What does making a holiday budget entail? Just follow these tips, and you can have one sitting in front of you today:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Use last year as a guide.</h4>
If you’re creating a budget for the first time, you may have no clue where to start. Just look at last year’s holiday expenses, and you’ll have the perfect starting point.

Look at the previous year’s receipts or bank statements for the following expenses:
<ul>
 	<li>Gifts</li>
 	<li>Food</li>
 	<li>Decorations</li>
 	<li>Cards</li>
 	<li>Postage</li>
 	<li>Wrapping paper</li>
 	<li>Travel</li>
 	<li>Entertainment</li>
 	<li>Donations</li>
</ul>
Include any other holiday-related expenses in your calculation. Once you have the final amount, use it as your guide for this year’s budget.

Do you see any unnecessary expenses? Highlight them before moving on to the next step, as they’re essential in yielding this year’s savings.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Determine how much you can afford to spend this year.</h4>
How does your monthly income stack up versus your expenses? Whatever money you have left after paying all your bills could be used for holiday spending. You probably don’t want to use every single cent, however, so figure out how much you can put aside for gifts and the like.

Depending on how late you start, you may not have time to save much disposable income from months prior. This lack of savings could affect your budget, but don’t let it cloud your judgment or cause you to panic.

If you don’t have much saved, try to cut anticipated holiday costs. It’s best to reduce spending instead of racking up debt that could hurt your credit score or ability to make future payments.

As you determine how much you can spend during the holidays, you may realize a budget constricts you more than before. Don’t look at this as a bad thing. Look at it as a way to build financial discipline and relieve financial headaches related to debt before they occur.

If you relied on credit cards in the past, think of how having to make payments on them year-round affected you. Did you enjoy seeing high balances well into the summer for all of those Christmas gifts you bought the year before? Probably not, and your budget this year can prevent that from happening again.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. Prioritize spending categories.</h4>
Now that you have a certain amount set for your budget, it’s time to plan how to allocate it. By prioritizing categories, you can do this rather quickly.

For example, let’s say you want at least half of your budget to go towards gifts and their associated costs like wrapping paper, postage, etc. Next, come food and donations. And so on.

By prioritizing, you can focus on what’s most important. If you notice some categories are left with little money, you may decide to cut them completely.

Once you have your budget allocated, it’s time to start spending. Again, do not let the budget’s restrictions get you down.

After seeing how much you have to spend, you’ll likely get creative and selective with your purchases. In doing so, you’ll instill solid financial discipline that you can use throughout the year.","You’ll need a holiday budget to end the year on a high note financially.

3502,"Follow These Rules When Using Credit Cards During The Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

See how you can avoid the credit pitfalls that plague many once the end-of-year shopping season kicks in.

Your credit cards can come in handy during the holidays. They can also create problems, however, if you use them without too much thought.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the best way to use credit for holiday gifts, food, travel, and other expenses so you don’t end up drowning in debt or other issues? Follow these rules, and you should be good to go:
<h4>1. Set a budget.</h4>
Credit cards often lead to increased spending since they delay the pain of paying with cash. Instead of forking over your hard-earned money, you can simply swipe to get what you want instantly.

Unfortunately, this delayed pain can cause you to overspend in a heartbeat. By having a budget in place and sticking to it, you’ll avoid the common trap of thinking credit cards are “unlimited” cash.

Figure out how much you can reasonably spend during the holidays. Subtract your monthly expenses from your income and come up with a figure from what’s left.

To be safe, don’t make the figure higher than your disposable income. Doing so will put you into debt by using credit cards.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Don’t collect new cards.</h4>
You’ll be swamped with offers of new credit cards from retail stores and other avenues. Avoid this temptation, as it could lead to further debt quickly.

Many retail store cards can lead to instant discounts, but they may have high interest rates that make them too costly. Also, applying for too many cards can increase inquiries on your credit report. This can lead to a lower credit score that results in a higher cost of borrowing later on.
<h4>3. Avoid maxing out your cards.</h4>
Getting too many inquiries on your credit report can lower your score, as can maxing out your current cards. For this reason, try to avoid maxing out multiple cards if your spending gets out of hand.

The higher your balances, the worse your credit utilization ratio. The worse your ratio, the lower your credit score.

To keep this maxing out issue at bay, use one main card for your holiday spending. Be picky about the one you choose too.

For instance, if a card has the lowest APR among your collection, use it to save on interest. Or if it offers plenty of rewards like cash back on purchases, use it to get the most bang for your buck.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

By using one card, you also make it easier to monitor your purchases and keep things under control.
<h4>4. Monitor and protect your accounts closely.</h4>
Speaking of monitoring purchases, you’ll want to do so throughout the holiday season. Credit card fraud is extremely high during the holidays, so keep an eye out for any odd charges.

Set up alerts on your accounts so you instantly see any new purchases. Check your accounts frequently as well.

When checking out in person, use your card’s chip instead of swiping, as it adds extra protection. If buying something online, make sure the site is well-known, secure, and has an SSL security certificate. Do not make any purchases if you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi network.","Don’t let reckless holiday credit card use put you in a hole.","2020-09-25 10:42:17",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3502,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-2.png,pasted-image-0-2.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-2.png,3503,"pasted image 0 (2)",,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-2.png,"Financial Help",_holiday,draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,follow-these-rules-when-using-credit-cards-during-the-holidays,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:13"
3506,"Do This To Avoid Holiday Overspending","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers --

It can be tough to avoid overspending during the holidays. Everywhere you look, you’re bombarded with commercials and material items staring you in the face. Combine that with pressure from peers and family to keep up with the Joneses, and it’s no wonder why it’s so hard to stick to a budget.

Luckily, there are ways to spend less while everyone else maxes out their credit cards. And if you succeed in doing it yourself, you’ll breathe easy while they wonder how they’ll make their payments on time.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

How many people spend more than they’d like to during the holiday season? Nearly half, since <a href=""https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/holiday-gifting-survey-november-2018/"">a Bankrate survey</a> found that 45 percent of people felt pressure to overspend during this jolly time of year.

Keeping this in mind, let’s look at some ways you can keep more cash in your pocket to avoid the financial stress linked to spending too much.
<h4>1. Plan ahead.</h4>
Make an overall plan and stick to it. This begins with a budget that lets you know how much you have to spend so you can allocate expenses properly.

Without a budget in place, you have no guide on where you stand. You won’t know when you’re spending too much or when it’s time to cut back. In short, not having a budget will lead to overspending and debt that can haunt you in the long run.

Besides budgeting, make a plan of how you’ll shop. Will most of your purchases be online or at brick and mortar stores? Will you wait for last-minute sales or get your shopping done early? By making this plan of attack, you’ll feel less pressure and be able to make better buying decisions.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

As a side note, don’t let early sales on Black Friday or Cyber Monday tempt you into impulse purchases. Just because something is on sale doesn’t mean you should buy it.

You can avoid this issue by making a list of who you need gifts for and what you plan to spend on each. Such a list will serve as a guide for when a gift is a necessity or just an impulse purchase to be avoided.
<h4>2. Stick to cash.</h4>
Buying gifts on credit cards costs more due to interest. It also makes it easier to overspend since you won’t feel that separation anxiety of letting cash leave your hand.

The convenience of credit cards can lead to a slippery slope of buying things you don’t need. Once you see your credit card statement later on, you may regret using them, so stick to cash instead. It’ll limit you, which can make you stick to your budget.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. Offer experiences or favors instead of gifts.</h4>
Many people don’t use the gifts they receive. You can use this to your advantage and save cash by offering experiences instead.

For instance, you could offer a grandparent a full day of fun as you enjoy a picnic together at a park. Or you could offer a friend or family member a particular house chore, like helping them paint. In doing so, you save and give them something more precious than any material item, which is your time and attention.
<h4>4. Do gift exchanges.</h4>
Do you have a vast network of friends and family? If so, you may want to suggest gift exchanges to limit how many items you must buy.

Secret Santa is great for families or work situations where many people are involved. Each person will buy just one gift, and it usually has a spending limit to guarantee savings.","If you’re worried that you’ll overspend this holiday season, these tips can help you stay within your budget.","2020-09-25 10:44:58",post,https://holidayrelief.com/do-this-to-avoid-holiday-overspending/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-3.png,pasted-image-0-3.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-3.png,3507,"pasted image 0 (3)",,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-3.png,Housing,,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,do-this-to-avoid-holiday-overspending,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-01 17:49:36"
3509,"Never Buy These 4 Things On Black Friday","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

In some cases, the answer is yes, such as the ones you’ll find in this article, so if you miss them on Black Friday, don’t sweat it.

What is a full belly from Thanksgiving usually followed by? Freaking out over Black Friday deals.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Why freak out, though? Black Friday isn’t the only day with deals. And if you know how to browse the Net, you can find great discounts almost every single day.

Can you find some bodacious bargains on this shopping holiday? Sure, but most of the time, you’re just buying the hype that million-dollar marketers know how to generate.

Several items are best bought during other times of the year. Retailers specifically price them at their lowest at these points in time for specific reasons.

While we may not go into all of the reasons why, we will let you know which items should be purchased when there are fewer crowds, less stress, and even better discounts than Black Friday.

In short, if you need to buy something on this list, your best bet is to do it when it’s cheapest. And several studies show that Black Friday is not that date.
<h4>1. Toys.</h4>
We all want our kids to see the best toys under the tree. But don’t let that temptation fool you into thinking Black Friday is the best day to buy toys.

Yes, there are tons of Black Friday toy deals online and in stores. Are they the best possible deals, though? Not necessarily, as many retailers like to offer their biggest bargains right before December 25.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Can last-minute toy buying get crazy? Sure, but if you want to find the deepest discounts, it may be your best bet.
<h4>2. Jewelry.</h4>
What’s one of the most popular gifts? Jewelry, but if it’s on your holiday shopping list, you may want to replace it with something else.

The most attractive jewelry deals tend to appear after the new year. January is prime time for jewelry shopping since it falls right before Valentine’s day.
<h4>3. Laptops.</h4>
Are you struggling to read this article and others because your old laptop is lagging? Upgrading it on Black Friday can be totally tempting, and you will find laptops for cheaper for those 24 hours.

If you can handle the wait, however, do so, especially if you’re looking for a high-end device.

The best laptops usually go on sale during July and September. That may seem like a long time to wait, but since it’s such a substantial investment, try to be as patient as possible with this purchase.
<h4>4. Smartphones.</h4>
Are your kids bugging you for the latest iPhone? That can be quite the tough wish to grant due to their cost once they hit the market. And just because Black Friday offers deals on other electronics doesn’t mean that a snazzy smartphone will be on sale.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

In terms of the latest, greatest smartphones, they’re usually best to buy once all of the hype dies down.

For instance, if you were looking to buy an iPhone for your kids or yourself and don’t want to break the bank, you’ll have to wait about nine months until it loses its popularity. Once a phone’s popularity drops, look for the price to drop too.","Are Black Friday’s deals overrated?","2020-09-25 10:50:19",post,https://holidayrelief.com/3509-2/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-4.png,pasted-image-0-4.png,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-4.png,3510,"pasted image 0 (4)",,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pasted-image-0-4.png,Housing,,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,3509-2,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-02-01 17:49:36"

3516,"6 Ways To Save When Eating Out","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As you look for ways to pinch pennies with your monthly budget, entertainment expenses like eating out are often the first to get cut. This can be a real drag if you love getting out of the house and going to restaurants.

Are there ways to maintain your restaurant hobby without breaking your budget? There sure are, and here are some that you can start practicing now:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Share your meals.</h4>
Have you seen the food portions at restaurants lately? Some are big enough to feed an army, which is why sharing your meals is the best way to minimize your dining expenses.

The benefit of sharing meals goes way beyond just saving money, as it can save you the extra pounds that come from all of those extra calories.

If you don’t feel like eating from the same plate, ask the waiter to bring out two plates. Many restaurants will gladly split orders to accommodate you.
<h4>2. Let your kids eat free.</h4>
Tons of restaurants have special occasions where kids eat free. Some of them do it every week, which can really help you cut costs.

For example, <a href=""https://pizzahut.com.ph/home"">some Pizza Hut locations offer a free buffet for kids under 10</a>, as long as one adult purchases a meal. IHOP, meanwhile, has <a href=""https://www.ihop.com/en"">free kids meals for anyone 12 and under</a> with the purchase of an adult entrée.

Are these the only places where you can find free children’s meals? Of course not, so look around at restaurants near you, and you’ll be surprised at what you’ll find.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Eat earlier.</h4>
Dinner is often the most expensive time to eat out. Get your restaurant fix out of the way earlier in the day, and you can find early-bird specials at a fraction of the cost.
<h4>4. Don’t buy beverages.</h4>
Water is free at almost any restaurant. If you’re not a water fan, be sure to buy beverages that come with free refills if you’re super thirsty.
<h4>5. Comb the newspaper for coupons.</h4>
Local Sunday newspapers often come packed with copious coupons from restaurants. Many of these offer buy-one-get-one-free deals that can help you skip the cost of an entire meal.

If you’re past the paper age and prefer something more high-tech, try downloading one of these apps to help you save:
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.groupon.com/"">Groupon</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.restaurant.com/"">Restaurant.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>6. Avoid the tip.</h4>
No, we’re not suggesting you stiff your waiter when you go out to eat. You can, however, cut 15 percent off your bill by not eating in the restaurant.

Many places now give you the option for curbside pickup. You can still order your favorite food, but instead of dining there, you can pick it up and eat at home.

By avoiding the dining experience, you can prevent the gratuity that comes with it. This alone can be seen as a coupon to help you get that flavorful fix at a discount.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>7. Sign up for apps.</h4>
Does your favorite restaurant have its own app? If it does, downloading it may be worth your time.

You can secure exclusive discounts via apps that may not be advertised to the general public.","Want to keep your monthly costs out of control while still eating out?

3519,"How To Travel Without Breaking Your Budget","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As long as your smart about planning your trip, you can see new places without going bankrupt in the process.

Checking off destinations on your bucket list can be tough if you have zero room in your budget.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While you could increase your income via a second job or a side gig, there are other ways to make your vacation dreams come true. These methods involve saving money instead of spending it, and they’re all quite doable.
<h4>First, Figure out How Much Money You’ll Need.</h4>
For this article, we’ll assume you don’t have a ton of extra cash sitting around to fund a spontaneous trip across the globe. We’ll also assume that you don’t want to pay for your vacation entirely on credit.

Before you can start packing your bags, you have to figure out:
<ol>
 	<li>Where you want to go.</li>
 	<li>When you want to go.</li>
 	<li>What you plan to spend.</li>
</ol>
When choosing where you want to travel, be realistic in terms of your budget. If your income and savings aren’t where you want them to be, you may have to plan a trip that’s not several time zones away.

As for when you want to go, keep in mind that certain times of the year are cheaper for travel than others.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

The holidays can be quite costly as other people drive up the demand for airfare and lodging. To avoid this, try planning your trip in between the peak and off-season.

This is called shoulder season, and it makes October an attractive time of year to hit the road.

If you’re unsure of when costs are highest, use online booking sites to see estimates.

For example, you could visit an airline’s site and enter in dates for travel to see when prices are lowest. You could do the same with hotel sites to help you pick the best time of year to travel. Doing this ahead of time will make planning and paying for your trip much easier.

When determining what you plan to spend, try to cut all the frills from your proposed budget.

Seeing new places is what’s most important, which makes things like eating out or staying in super-expensive lodging luxuries and not necessities.

You could buy groceries and save a ton on food by cooking in your hotel or Airbnb. You could also stay in a hostel or lower-grade hotel to save on lodging since you’ll probably be out and about sightseeing most of the time anyway.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Once you know what you plan to spend and when you want to travel, divide that total amount by the months until departure. That’s how much you’ll have to save monthly to meet your travel needs.

<h4>Money-Saving Travel Tips</h4>
With your trip planned, it’s now time to figure out how to get the most bang for your buck. Here are some tips for doing just that:
<h4>1. Purchase your airline tickets as soon as possible.</h4>
If you’re flying, buy your tickets in advance. The more you wait, the more they’ll increase as seats fill up and demand goes up.

Buy your tickets at least three to four weeks before your flight, and you should see some solid deals.
<h4>2. Don’t pay for your rental car in full.</h4>
Call your car insurance company and see if they cover rentals. This could save you a big chunk of cash should you need a rental car, as insurance can cost quite the pretty penny.

If you have credit cards with perks or rewards, see if they’ll pay for your rental car insurance as well.
<h4>3. Skip the souvenirs.</h4>
Do you love collecting things everywhere you go? This is perfectly fine, but it could burst your budget.

Make a rule only to buy one souvenir per stop. Or even better, skip the souvenirs and take pictures of your trip with your phone. They’re free and offer more vivid memories.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>4. Go with Groupon.</h4>
Booking a Groupon Getaway can help you save on transportation and lodging.

As a side note, if booking a flight online, pay attention to the site’s interface. Many now offer ways to bundle savings on lodging and rental cars too, if you book all three online with the same company.","A tight budget doesn’t mean you can’t see what the world has to offer.

3523,"6 Tips To Get The Most Bang For Your Buck When Traveling","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Do you have some must-visit places on your bucket list? Having a tight budget can keep you from checking them off, which is why it’s a must to save as much as you can on vacation.

While keeping up with your monthly expenses is essential, life requires occasional enjoyment too. And what better way to have fun than to see new places and meet new people?

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

To help you achieve that goal, here are some tips on how to stretch your money to the point that you can travel more often.
<h4>1. Make a savings plan.</h4>
Unless you have a bevy of bucks in your bank account, you’ll need to start saving to fund your vacation. There’s no better time than now to do so, either.

First, figure out where you want to go. Make a list of all the expenses you’ll incur on your trip, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Transportation (Airfare, bus tickets, train tickets, car rental, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Lodging ( Hotel, Airbnb, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Food (Groceries, restaurants, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Activities (Amusement parks, national parks, local attractions, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Souvenirs</li>
</ul>
When making this list, it’s best to overestimate instead of underestimating your costs. This way, you won’t run into an issue of having to put charges on your credit card that could lead to long-term debt.

Once you have your total, decide when you’ll want to take the trip.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

With that decided, divide the total expense by the number of months until it’s time to leave. That will give you the monthly figure you must save to make your vacation dreams a reality.

If you know there’s no way you can save that much per month, here are your options:

Delay your trip several months more.
Pick a less expensive destination with lower transportation costs or cheaper lodging.
Think of ways to supplement your current income to meet that monthly demand.
<h4>2. Do a day trip.</h4>
If your desire to get away is too much to handle, you can take an affordable day trip now to scratch that itch.

A day trip involves visiting somewhere nearby to give you that feeling of going on vacation without the cost.

By traveling to a closer destination, you can avoid significant transportation and lodging expenses.
<h4>3. Cut food costs.</h4>
Eating out while on the road can take a big chunk out of your travel budget. Bring snacks for the road and buy groceries to cook at your hotel/Airbnb, and you’ll save money for attractions and souvenirs.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>4. Reduce rental car fees.</h4>
While debt should be avoided, using certain credit cards can offer attractive travel perks. Check to see if one of your cards covers rental car insurance.

Another way to lower rental car costs is to see if your current auto insurance policy offers coverage on rentals.
<h4>5. Buy flights in advance.</h4>
If your destination is far from home, you’ll probably need to take a plane to get there.

Don’t wait until the last minute to purchase your tickets. Do it at least three to four weeks before you plan to fly to get the best deals.

Also, before you commit to your trip, look online for flight costs. You can see how much tickets fluctuate throughout the year according to the seasons, which could influence your decision to book your trip.
<h4>6. Stay home during the holidays.</h4>
The higher the demand for flights and lodging, the higher the price.

Try not to plan your vacation when everyone else is. Do it during shoulder season, and you should see some significant savings.

What’s shoulder season? The ideal time to travel, which sits between peak and off-seasons. To give you an idea of when to look, try October as your travel month.","Vacations can get so expensive, they can keep you home instead of traveling.

3527,"5 Things To Consider Before Buying An Affordable Laptop","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

<h4>1. Usage</h4>
What will you be using this laptop for? Will it be used to browse the Internet for a few minutes per day? Will you have it on almost 24/7?

Does your laptop need excellent video performance so you can stream Netflix and YouTube? Does it need optimal gaming performance that will require more power “underneath the hood?”

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What about the size? If you’ll be using it for video, you may want a larger screen. Or if you’ll be traveling a lot, you may want something more portable and light.

You’ll want to factor in all of these uses when picturing the perfect laptop in your head. The more casual the need, the more affordable it should be. And the more features that will be needed, the more money you’ll have to fork over.
<h4>2. Budget</h4>
You may have a fixed number in your head, but determining your laptop’s usage could shift that a bit. For instance, if you only wanted to spend $300, but need a gaming laptop, you may have realized your budget will need to be higher.

If you will use the laptop for a critical need, such as to distance learn or to work from home, you may want to increase your budget a bit. This will be an investment that should last for years, and by helping you study or work, it could pay itself off several times over.

On the other hand, you don’t want to buy something that you cannot afford, which can make this part a bit tricky. You will need to determine your budget beforehand to not only make your search easier, but also to ensure you don’t overspend.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Urgency</h4>
Did your old laptop die, causing you to need a replacement immediately? If so, you may be less likely to find that ideal deal. If you can wait, however, you should be able to snag some savings around these times:
<ul>
 	<li>The back-to-school period (June-September)</li>
 	<li>Product launches (Apple around September, Microsoft around October)</li>
 	<li>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Brands</h4>
Just like with cars, all laptop brands are not created equal. Some have better reputations than others. You’ll want to keep this in mind when doing your research, as the last thing you want to do is buy a laptop that you regret.

Use the convenience of the Internet to your advantage here. Search for laptop reviews to see which brands stand out from the crowd. Once you’ve picked a few, you can then start looking for models within your price range.

Once you find laptop models you like, read all of their reviews. Are there any red flags? If so, you may want to skip that model and the headaches that come with it.
<h4>5. Deals</h4>
A great deal on a laptop could make it too hard to pass up. No matter the time of year, there are always deals online that can get you the computer you need at a discount.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

You could use<a href=""https://www.joinhoney.com/""> an app like Honey to find the best deals for a particular laptop, or you could try sites like:</a>
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/"">Amazon</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.newegg.com/"">NewEgg</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.tigerdirect.com/indexus.asp?"">TigerDirect</a></li>

 	<li><a href=""https://www.overstock.com/"">Overstock</a></li>
 	<li><a href=""https://www.walmart.com/"">Walmart</a></li>
</ul>
If you don’t mind a refurbished or used laptop, you may get more bang for your buck this way by shopping on a site like <a href=""https://www.ebay.com/"">eBay.</a>","You probably want your laptop to be as affordable as possible.

While getting evicted from your home is one of the worst things that can happen when money runs low, having your lights cut off isn’t much better. You could call your utility company to try to negotiate a smaller or postponed payment, but what if they refuse after too many requests? If this is the case, you’ll want to look elsewhere for help, and here are some of your options:
<h4>Call 211</h4>
Dialing this number on your phone can help when you require emergency assistance. For instance, if your electricity was or is about to be cut off, calling 211 can connect you with a local operator that knows of assistance programs in your area.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

It’s worth noting that 211 doesn’t just help with essential bills. Should you have problems in other areas, they can help with housing, food, healthcare, and more. Keep this in mind if and when you call.

You can also <a href=""https://www.211.org/"">visit 211’s website here to learn more about their services.</a>
<h4>Contact a LIHEAP Office</h4>
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) may not pay all of your electric bill, but it can help with a significant portion of it that’s related to heating and cooling. If you can’t keep up with surging electric bills in the summer and winter months, LIHEAP can step in to give you that financial aid you need.

Qualifying for LIHEAP differs according to location, but if your household gross income does not exceed 150 percent of the federal poverty level, you should be good to go. You can also qualify if you receive some form of government benefits already, such as TANF, SNAP, or SSI.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

LIHEAP may not give you monthly assistance, as it’s intended to act as occasional help with paying a portion of your energy bill. Still, it’s good to know that you have an option here that could give you a boost when you need it.

Applying for LIHEAP occurs locally, although you may be able to fill out an application online. To find out how this program works in your area, <a href=""https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/db/index.php"">go here to find your local office.</a>
<h4>Find Other Forms of Utility Assistance Near You</h4>
<a href=""https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/profiles/energyhelp.htm"">This link from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> is handy for finding low-income energy assistance. Find your state in the drop-down menu, and you’ll be taken to a page with all of the energy programs at your disposal. Some, like LIHEAP, will be federal. Others will come from the state, utility companies, or local charities.

Hopefully, your state is loaded with low-income energy programs that can help you. If it’s anything like Florida, you should be good to go, as some programs offer free home improvements to improve energy efficiency, while others provide health with monthly bills.

3548,"2 Ways to Immediately Spend Less Money Durin gthe Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

If you’re reading this, you’re probably in the same rut that most folks find themselves in: despite believing in the “save money” mantra, your actions tend to waver from your beliefs.

Undisciplined spending, buying things you don’t need, and in some cases, flatout wasting money, all of these are the mortal sins that overspenders and bad budgeters are guilty of committing.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

But it’s okay. You’re only human, and frankly, unless you’ve been taught, most folks don’t magically wake up one day and start saving money.

It sounds obvious, but in order to save more money, you have to spend less money. Easier said than done, right?

But building off of our previous point, it’s time to teach you two quick-and-dirty ways you can immediately spend less money.
<h4>Define a Hard Spending Cap</h4>
Professional sports teams, depending on the sport and contest, are limited to a certain amount of money they can spend in a given offseason. While the sports world created spending caps to preserve competitiveness, we’re worried about spending caps for a different reason.

The reason you’re going to have a spending cap is so you stave off debt and the potential for insolvency.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

While similar to a budget, there are certain expenses that are going to always be there no matter what. Groceries, gasoline, taxes, and mortgage payments, all of these are a given.

But when it comes to things like entertainment or clothing, those are certainly items you can immediately examine when it comes to your spending habits.

Let’s say you like to play video games. Instead of recklessly spending hundreds of dollars a month, limit yourself to one or two games per month.

And just so we’re not picking on the video gamers out there, for the fashionistas, limit yourself to maybe two or three items per month, obviously, calculate your average spend.

Put a hard dollar amount on it, and stay disciplined. If you go over your cap, punish yourself. How, you ask? Subtract next month’s cap with the amount you overspent.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Treat Every Dollar Like It’s the Last One You Have</h4>
This may sound like an odd tip, but if you start to value money like it’s the last thing you have in the world, you’ll be more prone to saving it, or more importantly, only focusing on the things that really matter: food, water, shelter, and your loved ones.

Sure, having fun is a necessity but contrary to modern conventions, you can have fun without spending a lot of money.

To keep things in perspective, a 2018 assessment by the <a href=""https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/17/nearly-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day"">World Bank</a> determined that half of the world’s population survives on the equivalent of $5.50 a day; that’s $165 a month!

Start re-examining your spending habits and start viewing your dollars like they’re pure gold.

You’ll have more money for emergency funds, and you’ll be able to comfortably cover the absolute necessities without feeling like you’re being squeezed.","Saving money is a general goal just about everyone has.","2020-09-30 08:36:12",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3548,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1779939275.jpg,shutterstock_1779939275.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1779939275.jpg,3549,shutterstock_1779939275,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_1779939275.jpg,"Financial Help",,draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,2-ways-to-immediately-spend-less-money-durin-gthe-holidays,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:20"

In fact, some apps could make the difference between this fall being a time to remember or a time to forget.

Let’s talk about 3 apps that will help you get paid for the holidays, apps you can download right now!
<h4>Robinhood</h4>
With the 2020 market crash in March, the rise of an insanely easy-to-use mobile brokerage app fittingly named after the green-hooded hero known for robbing the rich to pay the poor.

This goes without saying, but this is not financial advice, but if you have never thought about trading or investing, Robinhood is a great option. By responsibly investing in stocks or increasing your knowledge of the financial markets, you very well could make a little extra money on the side. But use the app responsibly, and as always, assess your risk tolerance before any investments.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

But if you’re the risk-tasking type, there are ways you can multiply your investments, whether you’re looking to explore stocks, cryptocurrencies, options, or index funds.

And the best part? Unlike most brokerages, Robinhood is totally free to use!
<h4>Uber</h4>
Times being tough right now is no secret, but Uber is one of the many apps that is helping people make money as the job market slowly creaks back to life.

Using Uber, you can choose to perform a number of different roles. Looking to just do delivery driving? Uber offers its Uber Eats option, in addition to driving people from place to place.

This is a great app for people who like driving, enjoy bringing smiles to people’s faces (assuming they aren’t hiding away in their home), and building up your gift-giving fund for the winter holidays.
<h4>TrueBill</h4>
Unlike the other two apps on our little list here, TrueBill is more about saving money than it is about generating passive income. That said, if you are disciplined and buy into the TrueBill model, rest assured, you will be paid by the time they holidays roll around.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

TrueBill will automatically assess your current monthly spend, subscriptions, and even analyze your income, giving a projection of your monthly income and expenditure.

This is a tremendous option for those of you out there who struggle with making budgets. No more excuses! Download TrueBill and truly nail down just how much you’re spending and and saving, so ultimately, you can end up getting paid come holiday time!","There’s nothing quite like seeing a plus sign next to a number with a few zeroes next to it, preferably with a comma separating those numbers.","2020-09-30 08:39:12",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3551,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_556455493.jpg,shutterstock_556455493.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_556455493.jpg,3553,shutterstock_556455493,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_556455493.jpg,"Financial Help",,draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,get-paid-for-the-holidays-with-these-3-apps,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:20"
3556,"How to Say, ""Hello Holidays, Goodbye Credit Card Debt!""","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Crisp air, cool temps, family gathers, good food, what more could anyone ask for?

Well, I’ll give you something: can I be free from the clutches of credit card debt?

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you’ve pleaded with the universe (or your creditor) with something similar, it’s okay. You’re not alone. Credit card debt plagues tens of millions of Americans, and like those many folks battling the beat-down this kind of debt often inflicts, it can seem impossible to beat.

But trust me. You can and will get your credit card debt paid off. You just need the right game plan and a little bit of good ol’ fashioned discipline.

Here are a few trusty tips to pay off or at least make a dent in your credit card debt, so by the time the holidays roll around, you can focus on gift-giving and celebrating rather than APRs and unpaid balances.
<h4>Go “All In” On Your Credit Card Debt</h4>
In the game of poker, the phrase “all in” means a player pushes all of their chips into the pot, which often signifies the player is so confident in their hand that they are willing to risk it all on one hand.

You need to attack your debt with the same mindset. Every little bit of money on the side, that extra money you have saved up, and even that overtime you were able to scrounge last week, whatever extra income you’re able to muster, bring to bear against your debt.

Pairing passive income with your full-time income will serve as a force multiplier against credit card debt.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Pay Off Balances With the Highest Interest Rates</h4>
Albert Einstein once said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the world. Considering the guy helped build atomic bombs, that’s really saying something.

But as someone dealing with credit card debt, you unknowingly (or very, very knowingly) don’t realize that the whole reason your debt may have spiraled out of control is due to this very force. Whereas compounding interest is great for savings, it’s terrible for debt.

To prevent compound interest from continuing to wreak havoc on your finances, take out the credit card accounts with the highest interest rates first.

Aside from the psychological victory of seeing the balances vanish, you’ll prevent those mole-hill-sized balances from growing into mountains and the mountain-sized-balances from growing into Everest-sized balances.
<h4>Make a Budget</h4>
If you’ve resisted making a budget, well, that’s got to stop. These days, thanks to the proliferation of budgeting apps, it’s never been easier to make a budget.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

An app like TrueBill is a great place to start. TrueBill will automatically track your spending, your income, and even isolate subscriptions that you might have forgotten about. If you’re very diligent about how much you’re making and spending, you’ll know just how much you can devote to purely paying off your credit card debt.

Truebill can even help you customize for specific financial goals. So be sure to tell Truebill you want to wipe away your credit card debt!","Unless you’re the Scrooge himself, everybody loves the holidays.

3560,"Simple Ways to Save Money for the Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

A year ago, we were used to walking around without masks, not hearing about quarantines, and not wondering if the world will ever be the same again. The same can be said about your budget and your spending.

Most people don’t have a budget, have no idea how much they’re spending, and worst, have no idea how to save money.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

But today, the excuses stop here. There are so many stupidly simple ways to save money, ways you probably never even considered.

Here are 3 stupidly simple ways you can save money so you’ll have a lot more in your pocket for ribbons and gift wrapping come this holiday season.
<h4>Make Cents?</h4>
You know that shiny stuff that sometimes ends up on the ground or in between couch cushions? Those little shiny circular bits of metal? That’s called spare change.

Okay, jokes aside, as the world rapidly adopts credit cards and debit cards for all of their purchases, people have forgotten that cold hard cash still has value. While most folks eschew coin jars and saving spare change, you need to stop being like the crowd and start saving, even if it’s spare change.

We’re not alone in our wisdom. A groundbreaking app called Acorns takes the difference between your individual debit card expenses and the nearest dollar and “rounds up.” So if you spend a $1.89, Acorns will invest the 11 cents difference into an account.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Now, mind you, it would take over a decade to get $401.45 if you pocketed 11 cents every day for a year for a decade, but imagine if you rounded up every single purchase, multiple times a day?

Even better, Acorns will invest the spare change in stocks and bonds, helping you compound the seemingly worthless coins until they’re worth big money. The flexibility means you can keep some in your account and withdraw your accumulated savings to get something special for every special person in your life come this holiday season.
<h4>Plan a Gift-Giving Budget</h4>
People make budgets for things all of the time, but have you ever considered building a gift-giving budget? Like we said, stupidly simple, right?

Don’t wake up one day and procrastinate your gift-buying; make a budget in advance! Identify all of the items you’re looking to get and for whom, then, determine the total cost of buying all of those items.

Once you complete this part of the master plan, you’ll be able to earmark your funds, taking the stress away from scrounging up your cash at the last second.

Less stress and more money for gifts, told you it was simple!

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Make a Hard Spending Cap</h4>
Put a cap on your spending when it comes to optional, non-essential items. Blowing lots of money on takeout? Meal prep instead. Spending a lot on clothes or entertainment? Okay, it’s time to rein that in.

A hard spending cap, like our previous tip, is just one more way to earmark funds so you can make sure you can comfortably plan for when it’s time to buy gifts.","Life comes at you fast.

3563,"3 Ways to Generate Passive Income in the Covid-19 Era","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

No matter your station in life, it’s possible to make a passive income, even with little capital. There are a few uncharacteristic ways, ways you may have never considered, to make passive income despite the unprecedented times we find ourselves in.

Here are 3 ways to generate passive income in the era of Covid-19.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Be Assertive About Investments</h4>
Despite the negative impact Covid has had on the economy, right now is an incredible time to consider investing in the stock market. While this is by no means financial advice or a recommendation of a particular equity or investment, one of the worst things you can do with your money is just let it sit and collect dust, so to speak.

Look into passive investment strategies that harness the power of compound interest to be a force multiplier for your capital. Whether it’s stocks, money market accounts, CDs, or even mutual funds, there is an investment strategy out there that is perfect for your income and your stage in life.

Instead of continuing to put investments off, really take the time to educate yourself and do what it takes to truly develop a passive income strategy by leveraging the power of investments.
<h4>Get in on the Gig Economy</h4>
If you’re reading this, you could be one of the many millions of folks who have unfortunately lost their job or steady income stream due to Covid. Right now, more than ever, a lot of folks are without a steady stream of income, let alone a passive stream.

But luckily, there is a benefit to the rapid integration of technology into our day-to-day life: the rise of the gig economy.

The so-called gig economy refers to the rise of, well, you guessed it, gigs. Ride shares, food delivery, shopping, furniture moving— saying ”there’s an app for that” has gone from meta humor mantra to a frank assessment of reality.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Whether it’s doing food delivery a few times a week, finding an app that offers odd jobs, or some other form of passive income, you’ll be able to supplement whatever you already make, or in some cases, replace lost income with your new gig.

Even as the economy stabilizes, you can still retain your gig into the future, and it very well could become a passive income strategy for the long haul.
<h4>Look Into Freelancer Websites</h4>
A lot of websites on the internet these days have made a name for themselves as offering opportunities for freelance writers, artists, voice actors, and performers of all stations to fulfill remote jobs or gigs.

Forget apps, just fire up your laptop and make a freelancer account.

The beauty of remote freelance work is the flexibility and autonomy it affords. Want to work a lot this week? You can. Looking to chill out and take a break? You can do that, too.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Even when things normalize, you can still retain your account and use it to supplement your eventual full-time income stream.","Covid-19 has changed the world, but with great change comes great opportunity.","2020-09-30 08:50:39",post,https://holidayrelief.com/3-ways-to-generate-passive-income-in-the-covid-19-era/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_601351565.jpg,shutterstock_601351565.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_601351565.jpg,3564,shutterstock_601351565,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_601351565.jpg,"Financial Help",,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,3-ways-to-generate-passive-income-in-the-covid-19-era,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:20"
3590,"6 Ways To Get Emergency Rent Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

One monthly bill that cannot be placed on the backburner is rent because if you don’t pay on time, you could end up living on the streets. Whether you recently lost your job, saw a dip in income, or had an expensive emergency, here are some moves you can make to come up with that rent payment.
<h4>Communicate with your landlord.</h4>
Before you start looking for ways to scrounge up the cash for your rent, it’s best to be informed. You need clarity on the situation, so you know exactly what you’re up against, and you can find it in your lease.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Look for the part in your lease that discusses late payments and evictions so you can know your rights as a tenant. In many cases, it takes 90 days for eviction to begin. If this is true with your lease, you have a bit of time on your side to get your finances in order, as you could miss this month’s payment and make it the next.

Once you know where you stand by reading your lease, get in touch with your landlord. Tell them your situation and ask if you can pay at a later date. If you have some cash at the moment, you could ask if a partial payment is okay until you get the rest of the money.

By simply communicating, your landlord will probably be more willing to work with you than if you avoid them.
<h4>Ask friends and family.</h4>
One of the quickest and hassle-free ways to get emergency rental assistance is through your connections. Discuss your issues with friends and family and ask them for a short-term loan.
<h4>Get a payroll advance.</h4>
Your employer may be willing to give you a payroll advance so you can pay the rent on time.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Look for nonprofits.</h4>
You can get help paying your rent and utility bills when emergency strikes via nonprofit organizations like the <a href=""https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/"">Salvation Army</a> and <a href=""https://www.catholiccharitiesusa.org/"">Catholic Charities</a>. Are they your only options here? No, but they are the most popular.

You can <a href=""https://www.211.org/"">find local nonprofits and religious organizations by calling 211</a>. An operator can inform you of any organizations offering emergency rent assistance in your area and other resources to help you get back on your feet.

Another option would be <a href=""https://www.modestneeds.org/"">to get a grant from Modest Needs</a>. They can give you emergency rental assistance and help with other financial issues through donors looking to give a hand to those in need.
<h4> Start a GoFundMe.</h4>
Think of this as a way to ask friends, family, and strangers for last-minute rent assistance. You’d be surprised at how quickly a <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/"">GoFundMe</a> could give you the cash you need to pay your landlord. To make it work, you’ll need to be convincing in your campaign and describe why you need the money.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->
<h4> Get help from the government.</h4>
Unlike the other resources in this list, the government isn’t a true form of “emergency” rental assistance due to the time it takes to get funding. Still, you can use a program like Section 8 to get rental help in the future regularly, so you don’t run into this issue again.

3610,"See How The Government And Nonprofits Can Help Pay Your Bills","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

See how the government and nonprofits can help via various forms of financial assistance.

Thinking of the bills you have to pay every month can be overwhelming. First, housing takes a considerable chunk of your budget when you pay your landlord. Next comes food, which can be quite expensive if you have a large family to feed. After that comes the rising costs of utilities so you can keep the lights on and the water running. And once you’re finished paying all of that, you may have super expensive emergencies related to medical care.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Those monthly expenses don’t even consider things like clothes, childcare, transportation, and even a bit of entertainment to help you take a load off. Factor everything in, and it’s no wonder why so many households find themselves in a financial crisis.

You could get an extra job to try to keep up, but that comes with sacrifices of time, added costs of childcare, or fatigue. You could also get a loan from friends and family or a financial institution, but that will put you in debt and could only make your problems worse.

Where should you turn to, then? The government and nonprofit organizations that have several programs to help people in your exact situation. Here is just a sampling.
<h4>Where to Get Free Food</h4>
You have to eat to live, which is why food gets listed first. If you’re on the brink of starvation as you read this, you can get emergency food assistance by calling 211 or contacting every local church in your phone book. You could also visit these sites that can connect you to food pantries and food banks:
<ul>
 	<li>Feeding AmericaAmple Harvest</li>
 	<li>Foodpantries.org</li>
</ul>
To ensure you never go hungry again, you should apply for food assistance from the government. You’ll find various options on USA.gov’s Food Assistance page. From there, you can apply for SNAP benefits, WIC, and more.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Get Help Paying Rent</h4>
There may be no need to ask for friends or family for a loan so you can pay your landlord. You can get temporary rent assistance from nonprofits like these:
<ul>
 	<li>Catholic Charities</li>
 	<li>Salvation Army</li>
 	<li>Volunteers of America</li>
 	<li>Modest Needs</li>
</ul>
If you don’t have luck with those, or by calling 211 and asking the operator for rent assistance, try setting up a GoFundMe campaign.

Does the government offer emergency rent assistance? On the federal level, not really. However, they can help you avoid future issues with paying your rent through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program.
<h4>Assistance Paying Your Utilities</h4>
Some of the resources listed above also offer help with paying your utilities, so you can get a lot done by simply contacting them.

You can also keep the lights on in your home via the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

<h4>Help With Medical Bills</h4>
Don’t let a costly medical emergency put you on the streets. Learn more about the government’s Medicare Savings Programs or contact these two nonprofits:

3676,"6 Ways To Save Money Ahead Of The Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

As you start thinking about the holidays, you may feel a bit bummed about your budget. Why? Because, if you’re like many people, you may have lost your job or income due to the coronavirus shutdowns.

Does that mean this holiday season has to be completely void of gift-giving? Not necessarily, as you can cut spending in certain places to start building that holiday fund.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Sell used stuff.</h4>
You may want to buy new stuff to put in your house, but what about the old things taking up space right now? Unless you use them, you can put old items for sale on apps or the Internet to generate quick cash.

People hunt for bargains on used items all the time, so there’s definitely a market for it. Just go through your and pick out what you’d like to sell, snap a pic, and put it online. Garage sales work too, but if you want to put your things in front of as many eyeballs as possible, look at sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Poshmark, OfferUp, eBay, and Letgo.
<h4>2. End unnecessary subscriptions.</h4>
Look around, and you’ll notice that subscription services have popped up all over the place for everything under the sun. While they may not cost a ton by themselves, stacking a bunch of $10 per month subscriptions will add up and cut into your budget, so start being more selective of what you pay every 30 days.

For instance, if you have several streaming subscriptions to services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc., you may want to pause a few for now. Chances are, you don’t use them all, and that extra money can translate into additional holiday gifts.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>3. Eat in.</h4>
Although COVID-19 made it harder to eat out, you may still be splurging on other people’s cooking. This can become quite expensive, so cut back and start cooking at home.

You’ll save a ton of money by not dining out, and you’ll save a lot of calories too that can be reserved for all of those delicious holiday foods that are getting ready to appear.
<h4>4. Cut the cord.</h4>
If you already have some subscription services that offer entertainment, it may be the perfect time to cut cable. The average person pays over $100 per month for this service, so cutting it can bolster your budget bigtime before the holidays hit.
<h4>5. Go generic.</h4>
Are you used to filling your grocery cart with only brand name foods? Opt for the generic alternatives, and the savings will add up each time you hit the store.

You don’t have to skip out on every brand name item, but skipping some can help you cut food costs to leave cash for buying gifts.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>6. Lower your AC or heater.</h4>
Utilities can take a big bite out of your budget. You can reduce these costs by using your air conditioner or heater less often. Fall temperatures tend to be milder, so take advantage of that. You can also do things like closing your blinds or using a programmable thermostat to keep cooling and heating costs low.","The holidays are coming up, and COVID-19 may have made a dent in your income.

How do many people end the holidays? Overweight from all of that delicious food, and broke from excessive spending.

Some experts believe this holiday season will be different, though, due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s no secret that the global outbreak has put many in a tailspin, especially when it comes to money.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If COVID-19 has negatively impacted you through job or income loss, here are some tips to follow to avoid deep debt that’s often linked to too much holiday spending.
<h4>Stick To Cash</h4>
What happens when you use cash to pay for something? Your wallet becomes lighter and emptier, and a feeling of loss can appear.

On the flip side, paying with a credit card usually doesn’t carry those symptoms. Your wallet stays the same, and nothing “physical” disappears from your possession.

Of course, a feeling of loss can occur when you receive that credit card bill in the mail, which is why it’s best to stick to cash for holiday purchases.

With cash, you don’t get a false sense of security. You know that once it’s handed over to the cashier, it’s gone for good, and this can help keep your spending under control.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

How much cash should you use? That depends on your holiday budget, which you should create before spending a single penny on any gifts, decorations, etc. With your budget established, you can withdraw your holiday cash as a reminder that once you spend it, the shopping season is officially over.

How do you use cash for online purchases? Get a prepaid card. Whatever currency you put on it is your limit, which makes it much better than regular credit cards for year-end financial discipline.
<h4>Be Prepared</h4>
An easy way to rack up loads of holiday debt in a little time is to wait until the last minute to shop. Retailers know that last-minute shoppers need their products, which makes them less likely to discount them. And not only can procrastination cause you to miss out on the best deals, but it can also trigger expensive impulse purchases and whipping out your credit card.

In short, make your holiday budget as soon as possible. Withdraw that cash to set your limit. Then, start looking for deals so you can get your gifts in stock, on time, and at the lowest possible prices.

Which days are worth marking on your calendar? The most obvious ones are Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which surround Thanksgiving, but Free Shipping Day on December 14 is another way to score savings.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Be Creative</h4>
You don’t have to buy something from the mall or online to give a gift, as you can make your own or give the gift of time.

A quick Internet search will yield several homemade gift ideas and the steps necessary to make them.

Do you have no clue how much you want to spend during the holidays? Are you wondering how you’ll come up with the money for gifts? Do you feel so overwhelmed, you wish you could skip the holidays altogether?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, you’re certainly not alone, as COVID-19 has stumped many people in the same way. Luckily, it’s not too hard to come up with a budget, save and earn cash for holiday spending, and get the most bang for your buck while shopping.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Just follow these simple tips, and you should be good to go.
<h4>1. Come up with your budget.</h4>
In an ideal world, we would all have unlimited holiday budgets. This isn’t the case, however, and in 2020, your budget may be even lower due to the coronavirus pandemic.

To come up with a number that determines your spending limit, you have two options. First, you can figure out how much you can start saving per week by cutting unnecessary expenses. Then, figure out how long it will be until you start holiday shopping.

So, if you can save $25 per week starting now, and you won’t start shopping until four weeks from now, you’ll have $100 for your budget.

Can you buy a lot with $100? Not really, so if the number you come up with is insufficient, wait longer to start shopping so you can stack more cash. Or make it your goal to cut back even more and save an even larger amount of money per week.

The second way to determine your budget or spending limit is to come up with a number. Last year’s expenses can be used as a guide, as long as you include everything, such as travel, gifts, parties, food, decorations, etc.

With that dollar amount selected, divide it by the number of weeks left until it’s shopping time. So, if you want to spend $400 and you plan to start shopping in four weeks, you’ll need to save $100 per week.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Allocate your budget with a list.</h4>
If $400 sounds like how much you want to spend, you’ll now have to see where that money will go. If it looks like there’s no way you can satisfy everyone, you’ll need to shave your list until everything fits.
<h4>3. Make that budget money.</h4>
Your plan is in place. You know how much you want to spend. Now all you need is the actual money.

Here are some ways to come up with it via extra income:
<ul>
 	<li>Sell your used items online via sites like Poshmark, eBay, Craigslist, OfferUp, etc.</li>
 	<li>Find paying local gigs on Craigslist, which tend to increase around the holidays.</li>
 	<li>Do paying gigs online through a site like Fiverr.</li>
 	<li>Get a second holiday job.</li>
 	<li>Ask for more hours or a raise at your current job.</li>
</ul>
Here are some ways to save so you can reach your holiday budget:
<ul>
 	<li>Shop with a list and only buy items on your list to avoid impulse purchases.</li>
 	<li>Pause your gym membership.</li>
 	<li>Freeze or cancel subscriptions to Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Spotify, and other forms of entertainment.</li>
 	<li>Eat at home instead of eating out.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>4. Save when you shop.</h4>
If your budget is limited due to COVID-19 or other reasons, do your best to stretch every dollar by comparison shopping online. It helps you avoid the crowds, stay safe at home, and find the best deals within seconds.

If you have any credit card rewards, cash them in. What about gift cards? Any that are unused can be put into play to help you save. You can also take the homemade gift route by buying the supplies and following online tutorials to develop something unique and personalized.","If you’re wondering how you’ll make this holiday season a happy one, here are some tips to ensure you get some gifts without breaking the bank.","2020-10-20 20:07:10",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3682,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1496845307.jpg,shutterstock_1496845307.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1496845307.jpg,3683,shutterstock_1496845307,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_1496845307.jpg,"Work From Home",,draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,how-to-plan-earn-and-save-for-the-2020-holiday-season,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:25"
3685,"Do This In November To Stack Cash For Christmas","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

To say that 2020 was a down year would be an understatement. COVID-19 negatively impacted the world in more ways than one, and it left many with big hits to their bank accounts.

The pandemic may have you wondering whether or not this holiday season will be a dud. Will you have enough cash to buy gifts for the holidays, or will you sit on the sidelines?

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

The former can be your reality, even if COVID-19 caused job or income loss. How? By doing a No Spend November that can help you build that holiday budget, even at the last minute.
<h3>What Is “No Spend November”?</h3>
As its name suggests, a No Spend November is where you don’t spend money during the month. Obviously, you’ll spend on necessities, but any luxuries or non-essential items are out the window in this quest for last-minute savings.

What can make No Spend November so challenging? The fact that it comes when sales are plentiful, and a need or desire for spending tends to fill the air. Follow these tips, though, and you can make it through the month with willpower and discipline.
<h3>How To Do a No Spend November</h3>
<h4>1. Make a list of necessary expenses.</h4>
This list will include everything you must spend during November to survive and avoid ruining your credit or getting evicted, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Rent or mortgage</li>
 	<li>Utilities</li>
 	<li>Groceries</li>
 	<li>Healthcare</li>
 	<li>Insurance</li>
 	<li>Childcare</li>
 	<li>Internet</li>
 	<li>Cell phone service</li>
 	<li>Car payment, gas, and any other transportation costs</li>
 	<li>Pet supplies</li>
 	<li>Student loan debt, credit card payments, etc.</li>
</ul>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Make a list of unnecessary expenses.</h4>
With your necessities identified, it’s now time to list what you will not spend any money on, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>Eating out</li>
 	<li>New clothes</li>
 	<li>Travel</li>
 	<li>Entertainment</li>
 	<li>Non-essential shopping</li>
 	<li>Recreation</li>
 	<li>Hobbies</li>
 	<li>Personal care that’s not essential, such as nails</li>
</ul>
It’s worth noting that these lists are entirely yours. You don’t have to follow them to the T, although the stricter you are, the more money you’ll save for December.
<h4>3. Make a savings goal.</h4>
By only paying for necessities, you’re going to be saving a lot of money. How much money do you want to keep, though?

Look through your bank and credit card statements to see how much you usually spend on luxuries and impulse purchases. Get an idea of what you’ll save if you stick to a No Spend November. Then, come up with a savings goal for the month, so you have something definite to shoot for.
<h4>4. Make a spending goal.</h4>
Let’s say you vow to save $500 during No Spend November. What will you do with the money?

In the past, it may have been an easy call to put it towards holiday shopping. With COVID-19 still hanging around, however, the uncertainty may push you to put those savings into an emergency fund. Again, it’s up to you.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>5. Plan for the month.</h4>
You’ll be more likely to reach your savings goals by planning ahead. For example, within eating out removed from the equation, you’ll need to plan your meals so you can stock up on groceries and avoid any last-minute temptation. With recreational costs eliminated, you can search online for free ideas for having fun. And so on.

By planning, the thought of not spending money on luxuries in November won’t seem as harsh. It’ll prep you for what’s to come.
<h4>6. Track what you spend.</h4>
Whether it’s daily or weekly, keep tabs on what you’re spending. You can use a budgeting app to do so or simply write everything down in a notebook.

As you start to see savings, it’ll motivate you to continue. Who knows? You may stick to this no spend strategy well beyond November to keep even more cash in your pocket.","A “No Spend November” can help you save the cash you need for holiday shopping. Keep reading to see what it entails.

It seems like everyone could use some extra cash these days. It’s not just because the holiday season is almost here, either, as the coronavirus pandemic led to record-setting job loss.

In the past, recovering from such an economic disaster may have been a lot more complicated. Why? Because the Internet wasn’t around to connect us with others, and apps that offered ways to make money hadn’t yet hit the scene.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Now, however, there are plenty of ways to make quick cash, and whether you want that money to build your emergency fund or to buy gifts, here are some of the best-paying sites to reach that goal:
<h4>TaskRabbit</h4>
TaskRabbit is a great place to start if you want to see examples of what services people are paying for.

When you become a “tasker,” you can choose a location and a category. You’d be surprised at how much some of these gigs pay on average too.

For example, in Miami, here are some of the gigs you can do, along with their average pay:
<ul>
 	<li>Personal assistant - $20/hour</li>
 	<li>Errands - $20/hour</li>
 	<li>Help moving - $34/hour</li>
 	<li>Yard work - $26/hour</li>
 	<li>Waiting in line - $17/hour</li>
</ul>
As you can see, those are some pretty random gigs with great pay rates. It’s just a tiny sampling of what you can do, though, so head over to the site and see for yourself.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Rover</h4>
Imagine making up to $1,000 pet sitting. That would be quite the bump to your holiday budget, wouldn’t it?

Visit Rover, and you can sign up to be a pet sitter. Not only can you set your schedule and prices, but you can also be specific about what type of pets you’ll sit and even their size.
<h4>Sittercity</h4>
If you’re allergic to pets or would rather care for people, Sittercity can set you up with others seeking such a service. You won’t be limited to babysitting, either, as the site offers gigs taking care of children, seniors, and more.
<h4>Postmates</h4>
If you’d rather make money by being out and about instead of confined in an office or someone else’s home, becoming a delivery driver for Postmates may be your perfect fit.

Sure, you can end up delivering food to people’s doors, but Postmates also offers other deliveries that people need, but don’t want to get themselves.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Some delivery people make up to $100 daily with Postmates. With the pandemic keeping so many people inside, you could make even more by being on the front lines.

Are these the only sites and apps you can use to make quick cash on the side? Of course not, as they are just examples of some of the more popular options out there. You can find more by searching for online gigs or doing a specific search for freelancing, pet sitting, babysitting, and more.","If your finances took a hit from COVID-19, you’d be glad to know that there are ways to recoup that lost cash just in time for the holidays.","2020-10-20 20:28:53",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3688,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_326476022.jpg,shutterstock_326476022.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_326476022.jpg,3689,shutterstock_326476022,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shutterstock_326476022.jpg,"Work From Home",,draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,need-extra-holiday-money-these-sites-and-apps-pay-well,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:25"

Relying on your regular income is one way to finance your holiday spending. But what if that income was slashed once COVID-19 appeared on the scene?

It’s a common occurrence, as many lost their jobs due to the pandemic shutdowns, and this could leave you wondering if you’ll even have enough to buy gifts once December rolls around.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Well, regardless of whether or not your finances are out of order, you can quickly nudge them into order with some side hustles. You can now earn money doing almost everything under the sun, and here are some ideas to get you motivated:
<h4>Sit People</h4>
One of the most well-known side hustles is babysitting. Thanks to the Internet, you can sit people of all ages who need companionship, help running errands, etc.

Sittercity is just one example of a site that connects sitters with people seeking temporary care.
Visit their website, and you’ll see opportunities caring for babies, children, and seniors.
<h4>Sit Pets</h4>
If you’re more of a pet than a people person, you can make easy side money caring for dogs, cats, and other animals whose owners require such service.

Rover is a site that lets you earn up to $1,000 a month sitting other people’s pets. Sign up now, and you could get a nice boost to your holiday bank account by doing something you love.
<h4>Do Deliveries</h4>
In the past, being a pizza delivery driver was quite the popular side hustle. Nowadays, they have delivery opportunities for everything from restaurant food to groceries and personal care supplies.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

DoorDash is just one option that specializes in restaurant delivery. Postmates is another that delivers other items as well.

How much can you make with this side gig? That depends on how much you work and where you live, but some Postmates workers claim they make a cool $100 daily.

This side gig is growing more than ever, especially with COVID-19 floating around. With so many people wanting to play it safe at home, you can make more cash by bringing what they need directly to their door.
<h4>Do Odd Jobs</h4>
If you’re not looking to get into anything particular and want random gigs that pay, something like TaskRabbit may be right up your alley.

The site is loaded with odd jobs ranging from moving furniture to fixing a toilet to planting flowers. The pay is pretty impressive, too, as some people make over $70 per hour offering moving help, while others do personal shopping for $25 per hour.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Showcase Your Skills on Fiverr</h4>
Are you good at graphic design? Do you have a great voice? Do you know more than one language, which can come in handy with translation services? Any of the above, plus more, can land you quick cash on Fiverr.

List your skills on the site as a freelancer, and people can hire you for a pretty penny. Who knows?

3708,"Don’t Want To Waste Money This Holiday Season? Do This","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

It seems like many people would like to avoid this holiday season altogether. Why? So they can avoid having to buy gifts after COVID-19 wreaked havoc on their finances.

If you’re in this boat, know that saving money, even at the end of the year, is much easier than you think. You just have to follow these tips:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>1. Get in touch with friends and family.</h4>
2020 brought some extraordinary circumstances that caused many people to lose their jobs and see a drastic reduction in income. Chances are, someone in your social circle was adversely affected in this way. To reduce stress and avoid going into debt, get together with your loved ones, and see if you can change things up this year.

You can be sure that some families are putting holiday spending on hold for 2020 until things go back to normal. At the very least, you can make agreements to limit expenditures, so everyone enters 2021 both stress and debt-free.

One of the easiest ways to cut holiday spending within a group is to form a Secret Santa. It makes buying gifts incredibly simple by:
<ol>
 	<li>Limiting gift-giving to one recipient per person.</li>
 	<li>Including a spending limit per gift.</li>
</ol>
For instance, if you have a large family filled with kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews, etc., having a Secret Santa cuts your shopping list to just one person. No longer do you have to buy 50 gifts, making it much easier to keep your spending under control while saving you the time and stress that comes with holiday shopping.

If you’re worried about pitching this idea to family members, friends, or coworkers, know that there’s no better time to do it than in 2020. Most people may thank you for suggesting it, as the last thing on their minds is spending money they don’t have at the moment.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>2. Create a budget.</h4>
Hopefully, the Secret Santa idea catches on, as it can make the task of creating a budget super simple. If it doesn’t, and 2020 becomes a “normal” spending year, you’ll need to make the budget anyway, as it gives you a guide to stick to so you don’t go deep into debt.

A holiday budget doesn’t only include gifts. Instead, it consists of every holiday-related cost that’ll result in cash coming out of your pocket.

In short, don’t forget to include things like food/eating out, travel expenses, decorations, gifts, and even minor items like cards and postage.

It’s crucial to make your budget realistic too. If you know you’re going to spend more than your budget limit, increase it so you can stick to it and avoid putting purchases on credit cards or getting personal loans.
<h4>3. Create a shopping list that sticks to your budget.</h4>
Lists are essential at not only saving time, but also stopping costly impulse purchases. Make it a goal to only buy what’s on your list – even at the grocery store – and you’ll always end up saving money.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Make a list of people you need to buy gifts for, including yourself. Assign a money amount to each. If your list exceeds your budget, trim it until you get it right. Then, armed with your list, start looking for the best deals online and in newspapers, so you get the most bang for your holiday buck.","There’s no need to go crazy this holiday season, especially after the coronavirus’s negative financial impact.

3711,"Follow These Steps To Start Planning For Holiday Spending","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are some steps to avoid that costly strategy, especially in a year where money may be minimal.

If you think this holiday shopping season will be similar to all of the rest, think again. The coronavirus pandemic led to record job and income loss, which leaves many families with less money in the bank for holiday gifts.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

2020 is a year where you’re better off planning for holiday spending, so you don’t surpass your budget and get the most bang for your buck. Follow these steps to achieve those goals.
<h4>1. Make your holiday spending plan now.</h4>
While we are close to Christmas, it’s never too late to create a spending plan so you have enough cash for your holiday budget.

To make your plan, think of how much you can afford to spend this year. You can use last year’s holiday expenses for reference, but be sure to include much more than just gifts.

For example, here are some things that can dwindle your holiday budget and should be included in your calculations:
<ul>
 	<li>Food</li>
 	<li>Parties</li>
 	<li>Decorations</li>
 	<li>Travel</li>
</ul>
Once you have your total spending estimate, divide by the number of weeks left until you plan to start shopping. For instance, if you won’t go shopping until eight weeks from now and you plan on spending $1,000, you’ll need to save $125 per week.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

How can you save that extra $125 per week? We’ll discuss that in a bit.

While picking a number and dividing it by the number of weeks left works well for making a holiday spending plan, there’s another way to do so. With this second method, you determine how much money you can save per week for your holiday budget.

So, let’s say you determine that you can put away $50 per week for holiday spending, and you are eight weeks away from shopping. That would give you a $400 holiday budget, which would be your limit.

If that number is not enough, you could pledge to save more money per week or start to save earlier.
<h4>2. Figure out how to start saving or earning extra.</h4>
You now have a figure of how much money you’ll need to save per week to meet your holiday budget. Now you have to find ways to get to that weekly number.

Using the example above of $125 per week, think of unnecessary costs that are draining your bank account right now. Are you eating out a lot? If so, cutting that out and eating at home could help you reach $125 in savings relatively easily.

You can also cut out entertainment expenses, subscriptions, gym memberships, impulse purchases, etc.

If your expenses are already trimmed as it is, you can look to increase your income by getting a holiday gig, doing online gigs on Fiverr, Craigslist, or TaskRabbit, or by selling some of your used stuff online.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>3. Make a list.</h4>
As your savings stack up, you’ll have to determine how to split that money up. Do so by making a list of everyone who will be getting a gift from you, as well as estimates for food, travel, and other expenses.

You’re likely to find that not everything fits with your budget. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as it allows you to trim the fat and prevent overspending.
<h4>4. Make the most of your money when shopping.</h4>
The time has come to start shopping for holiday gifts. You managed to save your goal amount each week, leaving you with a stash of cash to spend.

To stretch that money, try the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Take advantage of special sales days, like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</li>
 	<li>Cash in any credit card rewards you may have.</li>
 	<li>Make your own gifts using tutorials on the Internet.</li>
 	<li>Shop online so you can comparison shop with ease while avoiding the crowds.</li>
 	<li>Use any old gift cards collecting dust in your drawer.</li>

If the pandemic punched you financially in the gut, it’s not too late to scrounge up the cash for a festive holiday season. You can get the money you need for holiday parties, gifts, and more if you turn November into a month filled with financial discipline.

How can you take part in this challenge to end 2020 on a high note? Have a look:
<h3>The Simple Steps To Complete a No Spend November</h3>
<h4>1. Separate your expenses.</h4>
The goal of No Spend November is to hold onto as much of your cash as possible. However, you will have some expenses as there are necessities that must be paid to keep your family fed and have a roof over your head.

Begin by making a list of necessities. These are expenses that must be paid either for survival purposes or to protect your credit history.

For example, you’ll have to pay your rent, car payment, insurance, groceries, Internet, cell phone, and so on. If you have debt in the form of student loans or credit cards, add that to this list as well, since you don’t want any dings on your credit report.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

While the first list contains your necessities that must be paid, the second details what you’re going to cut out for November.

These are luxuries or impulse purchases that you can live without, and they can usually represent quite the cash outflow.

It may not sound fun, but you’ll need to eliminate things like dining out, entertainment, shopping, travel, hobbies, etc. The good news is, many of these expenses can be replaced with free alternatives, so it won’t be as bad as you think.

For example, you can use free movie or TV apps like Pluto or Tubi instead of going to the theater or using Netflix. Or you can go to the local park instead of spending money at the skating rink or bowling alley for family fun.
<h4>2. Make your goals.</h4>
You’re obviously doing a No Spend November to save cash. Here’s where you determine how much money you want to keep, so you have a specific goal to aim for.

If you plan on saving $1,000 during No Spend November, the next step is to decide what you’ll use the money for. Will you keep it for a rainy day in case something else like the coronavirus comes around? Or will you use that cash to end the year with a fun and much-deserved shopping spree? It’s your move.
<h4>3. Plan and track.</h4>
By cutting out luxuries, you’ll need to plan how you’ll replace some of them. One place to prepare is with food, as prepping meals can save you a ton of time and money. As mentioned, you can also make a list of recreational substitutes that don’t cost a thing, so the month flies by while you and your family have free fun.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Once No Spend November begins, keep track of your progress by looking at your spending. Write everything down in a notebook or use a budgeting app to see just how much you are saving.

Once you see that progress, you’ll want to save even more. And once December rolls around, you’ll be glad that you completed No Spend November by having that extra holiday cash on hand.","If you’ve never heard of “No Spend November” before, now’s the perfect time to get more familiar with the concept.","2020-11-18 15:42:27",post,https://holidayrelief.com/?p=3714,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_122903674.jpg,shutterstock_122903674.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_122903674.jpg,3715,shutterstock_122903674,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_122903674.jpg,"Financial Help","Savings And Loans",draft,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,no-spend-november-can-help-you-save-last-minute-money-for-the-holidays,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:14"

While you probably wish 2020 would make a speedy exit due to COVID-19 and all of the other craziness, you still may want to enjoy the holiday season. That can be tough to do if you don’t have any money, which raises the question: What are some ways to earn holiday-boosting income?

The most obvious way to make money right now is to get a second job. Plenty of places will be hiring part-time workers to help with the holiday rush, but is that really your best bet? If you prefer to stay safe at home without being exposed to the coronavirus, a second job probably isn’t your cup of tea. However, selling used stuff could be, which is why now is a great time to declutter your house.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you didn’t take quarantine time to declutter, here’s your perfect excuse to finally mark it off of your to-do list. Not only will you reduce stress by getting rid of clutter, but you’ll also have more cash for Christmas by selling your things either online or locally.

If you’ve never sold anything online, don’t fret. There are many sites out there that make it super simple to do so, even for beginners.
Here are a few examples:
<h4>eBay</h4>
Let’s start with a site that you’ve probably heard of before. In fact, you may have even purchased something off of eBay before, but wondered how to get in on the action.

Here’s how:
<ol>
 	<li>Go through your home and pick out the items you want to sell.</li>
 	<li>Take good pictures of each item that showcase its condition and features.</li>
 	<li>When writing your product description, load it with keywords that a potential buyer may look for.</li>
 	<li>Set your item to “Buy It Now” for an easier transaction, or use the auction format to see if you can snag a higher price.</li>
</ol>

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Decluttr</h4>
From looking at its name, it’s rather obvious what this site is used for. Unlike eBay, however, Decluttr makes it even easier to turn your clutter into cash if you don’t feel like dealing with customers, shipping items, etc.

First, you declutter your home. Second, you gather up everything you want to get rid of. Third, you send a list of your items to Decluttr. Fourth, they give you an estimate of what they’d pay for those items. Fifth, you send Decluttr the items, if you accept their offer. Finally, you get paid.
<h4>Local Options</h4>
It can sometimes be easier to get cash for your clutter by choosing local options. These work well if you need money now and want to get rid of your items without much hassle.

What’s the downside to local selling? Having to meet others in person, which could prompt safety concerns for some.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you want to sell your clutter locally, you can bring it into a consignment store or have an old fashioned garage sale. You can also do a hybrid combination of meeting people in person after listing your items on sites like Craigslist and the Facebook Marketplace.","There’s no need to get a second job to stack cash for the upcoming holidays, as your household stuff may be the only source of income you need.

3720,"Is This The Best Side Hustle During The Pandemic?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may be used to having plenty of money saved up for the holidays so you can buy gifts, travel, go out to eat, and more. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic may have wrecked your plans by cutting into your income.

Does this mean you have to sit on the sidelines during the 2020 holiday season? Not at all, as there are plenty of ways to make quick cash.

One of the best of them, especially with the coronavirus on the scene, is making deliveries.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you’ve gone into a grocery store lately, you’ve probably seen a lot of people running around in uniforms and shopping carts filled to the brim with food and other items. Who are they? Delivery people for companies like Shipt, Instacart, etc.

What do they do? They take people’s online orders, pick up their stuff, deliver it to their doors, and get paid for their time.

While this job is nothing new, it’s exploded since COVID-19 appeared, as many people prefer to have someone else shop for them while they stay at home. This is excellent news if you’re looking for a side gig that offers some level of independence, plus extra money for your holiday shopping.
<h4>The Benefits of Delivery Jobs</h4>
You no longer have to work full time with a company like FedEx or UPS to make deliveries. Thanks to delivery apps, you can become an independent contractor. This allows you to choose your schedule. Depending on the app, you can even pick which deliveries you want to fulfill, and which you’d rather reject.

Are there expenses involved with delivery? Yes, such as gas, mileage on your car, etc. But once it’s all said and done, delivery, especially during the holiday season, can give you an excellent per hour wage to pad your holiday budget.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>The Best Delivery Apps To Work For</h4>
There is no shortage of delivery apps that can help you earn side cash. New ones hit the market quite frequently, but these are some good places to start:
<h5>Postmates</h5>
This delivery service is popular with customers due to speed. Many deliveries arrive within an hour, which makes Postmates’ demand high.

How much can you earn working for Postmates? Some drivers make as much as $25 per hour, which is pretty good for a side gig with no real experience required.
<h5>Uber Eats</h5>
Driving strangers around in your car isn’t for everyone. The company that offers such work now has an alternative in Uber Eats.

One benefit of Uber Eats is that you can request multiple payments daily. So, if you need quick cash, you may want to give this delivery service a strong look in the coming months.
<h5>DoorDash</h5>
DoorDash is well known in the food industry, so working for them could keep you busy and your pockets padded. You’ll mostly be delivering food from restaurants here.
<h5>Shipt</h5>
Want to earn up to $22 per hour making deliveries? You can do so with Shipt and get paid weekly.

Most Shipt deliveries are groceries, although you may have the occasional order for pet or office supplies to keep you on your toes.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h5>Instacart</h5>
There are two ways to make money with Instacart. The most common is being a delivery driver who picks out groceries and delivers them to the customer’s door. The second is to pick out the groceries, and leave them ready for the customer to pick them up at the store.

Instacart offers weekly payouts, plus tips.","Are you looking for ways to make money this holiday season, but you’re not sure what to pick?

3723,"How Much Can You Make As A Holiday Delivery Driver?","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

This year has been stressful enough, but it’s about to get worse for many people with the holidays lurking. You can blame this on COVID-19’s impact on our finances, as many people are wondering where they’ll get the funding to do holiday shopping this season.

As long as you have reliable transportation and some extra time, you won’t have to wonder, though. Why? Because there are plenty of delivery apps that are hiring drivers, and you can make a pretty penny doing this side hustle.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Delivery apps have been around for a while, but they’ve grown in popularity as many people want to social distance at home. They also provide a level of convenience that beats having to get your own groceries, so it looks like these apps will be here to stay long after the coronavirus disappears.
<h4>Reasons To Become a Delivery Driver Right Now</h4>
Doing deliveries may have a bad rap. Many may think of it as a low-paying job, but that’s no longer the case. Sure, it may be tough to make decent dough delivering pizzas. But with almost everything under the sun being delivered nowadays, your opportunities are endless.

Why choose a delivery gig? Besides being a quick way to supplement your holiday budget, the barrier to entry is low. As long as you’re of age (18, in most cases) and have a license and reliable transportation, you should be good to go.

Another reason to choose delivery driving as a side gig is its flexibility. Unlike a typical second job, you can select your schedule. You can even choose which specific deliveries you want to take, giving you a sense of control and power over your time.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Payouts with delivery apps tend to be quick as well. You usually don’t have to wait two weeks to be paid, and some even allow you to request daily payouts when you need them. How much can a payout be? That depends on your schedule, but when you consider that some delivery drivers make around $25 per hour, you could be taking home a nice, fat check.

Lastly, there’s one huge reason to become a delivery driver right now: The holidays. People tend to be more giving during the holidays, which means you could make more money in tips. And since the season is hectic, you could see a lot more work than in other parts of the year.
<h4>Popular Delivery Apps That Are Hiring</h4>
Now that you see the benefits of doing a delivery side gig and how much you can make, here’s a list of some apps that are worthy of a strong look:

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<ul>
 	<li>Postmates – Customers love this app for its speed, leading to many work opportunities for you. Some Postmates drivers make $25 per hour.</li>

You have a couple of options this holiday season. First, you could sit it out like many people are choosing to do since COVID-19 ruined their year, and tell your friends and family that your finances don’t allow for any gifts, parties, etc. Or, you could participate and make some purchases, but do so by saving as much money as possible in mind.

Thanks to the Internet, shopping for the best price is now easier than ever. You don’t have to go from store to store to pinpoint the best deal, as easy-to-use apps will do all of the work for you. Here are some of the best shopping apps that will compare prices, so you don’t pay a penny more than you should.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Amazon – Android, iOS</h4>
The coronavirus pandemic may have shifted your shopping habits online so you can safely social distance at home. What’s one of the most popular online shopping sites? Amazon.com, and it has an app to help you check prices with ease.

When you have the Amazon app on your smartphone and see an item in a store that interests you, use its barcode scanner to check the price. It’ll show you the item on Amazon, so you can see where the best deal is and decide to buy it in-store or on the website.

The app is also helpful in showing reviews, so you can see if the item is worth your hard-earned money and buy it with confidence.
<h4>Shopbrain – Android, iOS</h4>
Like the Amazon app, Shopbrain has a built-in barcode scanner to use when shopping to compare prices. Scanning a barcode will instantly show you where that item is being sold, and at what price.

Shopbrain also has a feature that showcases daily deals that might catch your attention.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>ShopSavvy – Android, iOS</h4>
Do you want to know when major stores are having sales? Are you interested in seeing how much an item is online and at competitors? Use ShopSavvy, and you’ll get all of that information with ease.
<h4>Mycartsavings – Android, iOS</h4>
Here’s an app that offers a bit of a different benefit from those above. With Mycartsavings, you can track the price of a product and receive email alerts. This is perfect if you want something, but are only willing to pay a certain amount for it.

When the product’s price dips below your expected price, you’ll be notified via email so you can snag it at that desired discount.
<h4>Yroo – Android, iOS</h4>
Like most of the apps on this list, Yroo has a barcode scanner for instant price comparisons while you’re shopping. It also has daily deals from places like Best Buy, Walmart, Amazon, and eBay.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>BuyVia – Android, iOS</h4>
This trusty app has several features that make it worth downloading, especially if you’re looking to buy electronics. First, you can use its barcode scanner to find the lowest price for a product when you’re out and about. Second, you can see product reviews before deciding to buy. Third, you can set up alerts to see when something goes on sale. Lastly, you can see daily deals from top retailers.","If you’re strapped for holiday cash due to COVID-19, these apps can help you save whatever money you have.

Ideally, you’d use this holiday season to save your money and not spend it since COVID-19 probably taught you about the importance of having an emergency fund. You may have been furloughed, seen your income dip, or lost your job altogether, making your finances a bit messy and money much tighter.

Does this mean you can’t enjoy the holidays and shop a little bit? Of course not. It just means you should be careful about your spending, which is precisely what following these tips will help you accomplish. Before we start, remember that the goal is to enjoy the end of 2020, but ensure you don’t start 2021 deep in debt.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Don’t Use Spending To Cope With Coronavirus-Caused Anxiety</h4>
This year has been filled with anxiety and uncertainty for several reasons. What do many people due to cope with anxiety? They spend money to get that quick dopamine rush that makes them feel good.

Avoid spending as a way to forget this year’s crazy events. It may make you feel good initially, but once reality sets in and you realize how much you spent, it’ll only make things worse.

If you know that spending is your go-to move when feeling down or anxious, try other coping strategies like meditation, breathing exercises, talking to a loved one, playing with your pet, etc.
<h4>Don’t Forget To Download Comparison Shopping Apps</h4>
There’s an effortless way to ensure you never overpay for your holiday gifts: Download price comparison apps, such as Shopbrain, Amazon, Yroo, and ShopSavvy.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

Such apps can help you see which retailer has an item for the lowest price, and they even have barcode scanners so you can get greater insight into a product when shopping at a store.

While shopping for the best prices may have been a hassle in the past, you no longer have an excuse not to do it. Try some of those apps above, and you’ll see that getting the best deals takes a matter of seconds.
<h4>Don’t Feel Like Every Deal Is a Must</h4>
On a day like Black Friday, for example, it’s easy to have a fear of missing out. You feel that those deals will never appear again, which can trigger you to buy items you don’t need or can’t afford.

With the Internet, handy apps, and more, you can find deals all year long, so there’s no need to snag every good deal you see, unless it’s something you need and it fits in your budget.
<h4>Don’t Forget To Plan and Budget</h4>
Speaking of your budget, make sure you have one before your shopping season starts. Budgeting apps make it very easy to make one, and don’t forget to make a list, either.

With your budget and list in place, you have a guide to keep you from overspending. Stick to both, and you should be good to go as far as staying debt-free is concerned.

<h4>Don’t Overdo It</h4>
2020 is an abnormal year, so there’s no need to be normal with your spending. Tell your loved ones that there will be fewer gifts due to COVID-19 and the financial issues it caused. They’ll surely understand, and it’ll take a much-needed load off of your shoulders.","The coronavirus pandemic has been stressful enough.

3732,"School Breakfast Program: Frequently Asked Questions","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

You may not eat breakfast every day due to a lack of time and being in a rush. However, if your child is not eating that morning meal due to a lack of income, that can be a problem.

School days are long, which is why children need to start their days off right with a nutritious breakfast. And even if you’re having trouble affording that meal, you may not have to pay for it anymore if you qualify for the School Breakfast Program (SBP).

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Here are some frequently asked questions about this popular program, plus answers to see how it can help you.
<h4>1. What is the School Breakfast Program?</h4>
It started in 1966 as a test to see how providing breakfast could help children from low-income households. After seeing success, Congress made the SBP into an official entitlement program in 1975.
<h4>2. How many kids use the SBP?</h4>
In its early years, the SBP was used by about half a million children. That number ballooned 20 years later to the four million mark. As of 2016, nearly 15 million children used the SBP to get much-needed nutrition in the morning.
<h4>3. Who runs the School Breakfast Program?</h4>
The Food and Nutrition Service, which makes up part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), runs the School Breakfast Program at the federal level. State agencies, however, are the ones in charge of working with local schools to get breakfasts distributed to those who need them most.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>4. Is the SBP reserved for public school students only?</h4>
While public schools make up a massive chunk of SBP use, they are not the only institutions participating in this food assistance program. Non-profit private schools, charter schools, and childcare institutions also work with the SBP to get their students fed before classes start.
<h4>5. Who pays for the breakfasts?</h4>
Schools serve breakfasts to students who qualify. They do this either for free or offer those breakfasts at a low, affordable cost that does not exceed 30 cents per meal.

As long as the school serves breakfasts that meet the program’s nutritional requirements, they get reimbursed for each meal with a USDA cash subsidy.
<h4>6. How do you qualify for the School Breakfast Program?</h4>
Your child can get free breakfasts if your household’s income sits below 130 percent of the federal poverty level. If your income is between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty level, your child may get low-cost breakfasts that, as mentioned, cannot exceed 30 cents each.

Income is just one way to determine eligibility, though. A child can also get SBP benefits if they receive some other form of federal assistance, like food stamps, or if they are a runaway, migrant, foster child, or homeless.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>7. If you qualify for the SBP, how will your child receive their breakfast?</h4>
SBP recipients usually get breakfasts before or during morning classes. They may go to the cafeteria to eat or get a classroom breakfast or something in a to-go bag.","The School Breakfast Program could make sure your child never has to start school when they’re starving.

3735,"5 Tips To Stop Impulse Purchases So You Can Save For The Holidays","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Has COVID-19 flustered your finances? If you’re like a lot of people, it probably has. Whether via job or income loss, or the need to play it safe so you have money for emergencies, the coronavirus outbreak has likely affected your finances somehow.

You may not be up to buy a ton of gifts this year as you’ve done in the past. Still, you’d like to have a decent holiday budget so you can buy what you need and make everyone happy.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Getting a second job or selling your stuff could add to your holiday budget, but an easier way to achieve that goal is to start saving right now. This doesn’t mean you have to deprive yourself of food or always do deep dives for discounts, either, as merely stopping expensive impulse purchases can do the trick.
<h3>Examples of Impulse Purchases</h3>
You’ve probably heard of an impulse purchase before, but if you don’t know exactly what it is, here’s the gist: Picking up something you didn’t plan to buy or don’t need.

For example, you may snag a cool, unnecessary gadget while buying paint you needed at the home improvement store. Or you decide to buy three candy bars at the grocery store when all you came to buy were eggs.

How expensive are impulse purchases? According to CNBC, consumers spent $5,400 per year on these unnecessary buys in 2018.

Now that you see just how costly impulse buying can be, let’s look at how to stop it right now, so your holiday budget gets bigger.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>1. Only shop with a list.</h4>
Use a list as your shopping guide, so you save time and money at stores. If something is not on your list, do not buy it, no matter how tempting it may be.
<h4>2. Only shop with cash.</h4>
Keep your credit cards at home. Without their seemingly unlimited buying power in your pocket, you’ll be less likely to buy things you don’t need.
<h4>3. Don’t shop as a hobby.</h4>
Is going to the mall to walk around and see what’s new a fun thing to do? Of course, but retailers know this, and they’re experts at putting enticing items in the window to trigger impulse purchases.

Whether it’s shopping in person or online, don’t browse things you know are a weak spot. You’ll eventually give in and leave yourself with less spending money for the holidays. You’ll be much better off seeing shopping as a chore and sticking to your lists.
<h4>4. Make online shopping harder.</h4>
With COVID-19, more people are shopping online than ever. Not only is it safer, but online shopping is also more convenient.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

If you’re a big fan of shopping on the Internet, make it harder for yourself to buy things by:
<ol>
 	<li>Blocking websites that tempt you.</li>
 	<li>Deleting saved credit card information for quick, one-click checkouts.</li>
 	<li>Unsubscribing from email lists that send you constant promotions.</li>
 	<li>Using an ad blocker to prevent targeted advertisements from filling your screen.</li>
</ol>
<h4>5. Ask for help from friends and family.</h4>
Your expensive impulse purchases can affect your loved ones. If you feel like you cannot control frivolous spending on your own, ask for someone to be your accountability partner.

Take them with you to the store so they can help you combat impulse buying. Just make sure it’s someone who’s not afraid to speak up when you whip that credit card out.","Are you scrambling for ways to figure out how you’ll buy gifts this holiday season?

If so, look at this list of food assistance programs from the government made with kids in grades K-12 in mind.

If you’ve thought about applying for food assistance programs in the past to keep food on your family’s table, you probably know about food stamps or SNAP. You may also know about WIC if you have any babies or very young children.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While either of those programs can give your children’s nutrition a significant boost, many more exist that can do the same.

The USDA is in charge of these programs. As you’ll see, they can help kids from kindergarten to high school ensure they never have to study on an empty stomach.
<h4>School Breakfast Program</h4>
School days are long. Could you imagine having to endure one without eating a sufficient breakfast? Such a task would be tough to do for one day, let alone five days per week.

Thanks to the School Breakfast Program, breakfast is not an issue, as qualifying K-12 kids can <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program-sbp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">get their morning meal for free</a> each day that school is in session.
<h4>National School Lunch Program</h4>
Getting a healthy start in the morning with a good breakfast is great. What about lunch, though? Some kids come from families with very little money for food, meaning they could go to school without lunch while their classmates get to eat.

The National School Lunch program tackles this problem with <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/national-school-lunch-program-nslp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">lunches that are balanced and nutritious and free or at least affordable</a>.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Child and Adult Care Food Program</h4>
With breakfast and lunch out of the way, what about what happens after school? Your kids can still get hungry then, which is what the Child and Adult Care Food Program addresses.

Through this program, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">kids can get food</a> while in afterschool programs, childcare centers, or emergency shelters.
<h4>Summer Food Service Program</h4>
While the three food assistance programs above keep kids K-12 fed when school’s in session, the Summer Food Service Program ensures they get to eat while they’re on break. This is a great relief for many low-income parents who wonder how they’ll <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/summer-food-service-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">feed their children when classes are out</a>.
<h4>Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program</h4>
Childhood obesity is a significant problem in the United States. The USDA made a major move to attack it by instituting the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.

Since many low-income households lack the funds for food, nutritious fruits and veggies may get skipped at the store in favor of cheaper options. This program gives kids from such families the chance to enjoy these healthy foods to <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/ffvp/fresh-fruit-and-vegetable-program"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">get proper nourishment</a> and combat obesity at the same time.

<h4>Special Milk Program</h4>

3744,"4 Ways Seniors Over 60 Can Get Food Assistance","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

We’ll reveal four food assistance programs from the government that can help ease your worries.

When you’re getting close to retirement age, the last thing you want to worry about is nutrition. You may have never had problems putting food on the table before, but as you stop working and rely on a fixed income, it could become an issue at an older age.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What can a senior do to ensure they get the food they need without breaking the bank? You could try different ways to save money while shopping, stop eating out, etc. However, a better option is to see if one of these four programs from the USDA can give you that necessary food assistance at no cost.
<h3>Food Assistance Programs for Seniors</h3>
<h4>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</h4>
Have you ever heard of food stamps? You probably have. In fact, you may have even used them at one point in your life to help you get by.

While that same program still exists, it now goes by a different, more formal name of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

This food assistance program wasn’t created with seniors in mind, as it helps people of all ages ensure their nutritional needs are met. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t participate and get SNAP benefits if you’re a senior.

If you qualify for SNAP, it can be a significant boost to your monthly food budget. You can get funds loaded onto an EBT card that you can take to participating grocery stores. Use that card as if it was a debit card, pay for those groceries that meet SNAP requirements, and you’ll be good to go.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>Child and Adult Care Food Program</h4>
While SNAP tends to work best for seniors who live independently, the Child and Adult Care Food Program helps those with different needs.

If you attend an adult daycare center, you may qualify for this program that offers nutritious snacks and meals via reimbursement. You may also be eligible if you’re over 60, have a disability, and are enrolled in a daycare facility.
<h4>Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program</h4>
Some seniors may have a menu that’s not up to snuff when it comes to nutrients. This can lead to deficiencies that can balloon into costly or even deadly health problems down the line. Since low-income seniors may have trouble buying nutrient-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, the USDA initiated the Senior Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program to fill that void.

Qualify for this particular food assistance program, and you can gain access to the freshest fruits, veggies, herbs, and even honey grown locally. You can find these foods through participating roadside stands and farmers’ markets in your area.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Commodity Supplemental Food Program</h4>
As its name suggests, this USDA food program acts as a supplement to your daily diet. It may not provide enough food to sustain you as SNAP can, but it’s worth looking into.

Once you qualify, you can expect nutritious foods from the USDA in a monthly food package.","If you’re over 60 and concerned about how you’ll feed yourself on a fixed income, keep reading.

3747,"Have A Question About WIC? Find The Answer Here","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

One of the most popular food assistance programs for women and their young children is WIC. And while you’ve probably heard of it before, you may be wondering how it works and if you could qualify. Well, there’s no need to wonder anymore, because here are some frequently asked questions and answers on this program.
<h4>1. What is WIC?</h4>
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children is a program that started in 1974. It was set up to help women, infants, and children from low-income households considered at nutritional risk. WIC achieves this goal not only by offering nutritious foods, but also through education and referrals to similar programs.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>2. Where does WIC operate?</h4>
Since the federal government funds WIC, it comes as no surprise that it is offered in all 50 states. You can also receive WIC benefits in Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and via 34 Indian Tribal Organizations.
<h4>3. Who is in charge of WIC?</h4>
As mentioned, WIC is funded by the federal government. State agencies are responsible for administering the program, however. You can receive WIC services at various locations, such as schools, hospitals, county health departments, and Indian Health Service facilities.

You can find your local agency by going <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/contacts?f%5B1%5D=program%3A32"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.
<h4>4. Who is eligible for WIC?</h4>
WIC benefits are offered to women who are pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding. Infants and children up to five years old can also qualify. Beyond fitting into one of those categories, you’ll need to meet specific income and state residency requirements. Lastly, a health professional or official will have to determine that you are at nutritional risk to be eligible.

While your best bet is to contact your local agency to find out if you’re eligible, you can use <a href=""https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps/pages/preScreenTool.xhtml;jsessionid=f19bbaa33064b377ce7ff5be36a6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this WIC PreScreening Tool</a> to find out more. It’s worth noting that if you already receive other assistance programs, that could make you eligible for WIC in terms of income.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

<h4>5. What type of benefits does WIC offer?</h4>
WIC’s most significant benefit is food. As stated, recipients get nutritious foods to supplement their diets and take them out of that nutrition risk zone.

WIC has a specific list of foods that qualify for the program, which include:
<ul>
 	<li>Baby foods</li>
 	<li>Canned fish</li>
 	<li>Cheese</li>
 	<li>Dried/canned peas and beans</li>
 	<li>Eggs</li>
 	<li>Fruit or vegetable juice</li>
 	<li>Fruits</li>
 	<li>Infant cereal</li>
 	<li>Iron-fortified adult cereal</li>
 	<li>Milk</li>
 	<li>Peanut butter</li>
 	<li>Soy-based drinks</li>
 	<li>Tofu</li>
 	<li>Vegetables</li>
 	<li>Whole wheat bread</li>
 	<li>Yogurt</li>
</ul>
In some cases, beneficiaries may receive iron-fortified infant formula or medical foods.

Your benefits can come in the form of food deliveries to your home or through distribution sites. In the past, vouchers and paper checks allowed recipients to pay for food after shopping, but that has just switched to EBT cards that you can use similar to a credit card.

Beyond food, WIC also provides counseling on breastfeeding and nutrition, health screening, immunization screening, substance abuse help, and more.
<h4>6. What qualifies as “nutrition risk”?</h4>
This term breaks down into two main categories: Medically-based risks and dietary risks. The first group includes issues such as being underweight, anemia, poor pregnancy outcomes, and pregnancy complications. The second includes not meeting current nutritional guidelines or practicing insufficient nutrition practices.

<h4>7. How do you apply for WIC?</h4>

3750,"12 Facts About WIC Food Benefits That You Should Know","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

Here are 12 facts about the program that you should know.

<h4>1. WIC helps these specific groups boost their nutrition, who otherwise may not be able to due to living in a low-income household:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Women who are in the pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding stages</li>
 	<li>Infants</li>
 	<li>Children up to five years of age</li>
</ul>

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

While WIC is reserved explicitly for those three main categories, applicants must also be considered a “nutrition risk” to qualify for benefits.
<h4>2. Nutrition risk is determined by a health official.</h4>
This descriptor that’s essential to be eligible for WIC benefits breaks down into two categories:

Medically-based risks – Due to anemia, underweight, pregnancy complications, poor pregnancy outcomes.
Dietary risks – Due to insufficient nutrition practices or falling below current nutritional guidelines.
<h4>3. You must meet income requirements to qualify for WIC.</h4>
If you make more than a certain amount, your household may not be eligible to receive WIC benefits.
<h4>4. You must meet state residency requirements.</h4>
You’ll need to live in the state where you apply for WIC benefits.

 	<li>Hospitals</li>
 	<li>Schools</li>
 	<li>Indian Health Service facilities</li>
</ul>
<h4>7. WIC has been around for a while.</h4>
If it’s new to you, know that WIC is not new to the United States, as it began in 1974.
<h4>8. There’s a tool to determine your WIC eligibility.</h4>
You can test whether you may be eligible for WIC using the program’s PreScreening Tool found <a href=""https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps/pages/preScreenTool.xhtml;jsessionid=f19bbaa33064b377ce7ff5be36a6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">here</a>.
<h4>9. You can apply for WIC locally.</h4>
The PreScreening Tool above comes in handy to help get the ball rolling in your quest for WIC benefits. To make it official, however, <a href=""https://www.fns.usda.gov/contacts?f%5B1%5D=program%3A32"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">apply through your local WIC agency</a>. You will need to make an appointment, and they will tell you what to bring so you’re prepared.
<h4>10. Participation in other assistance programs is a good thing.</h4>
If you receive some other form of government benefits, it can help you qualify for WIC instead of making you ineligible. This is good news if you were worried about already receiving government assistance negatively impacting your WIC eligibility.

3753,"See How SNAP Helps Seniors As They Age","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2.8 million homes with an older adult experienced food insecurity in 2016. In other words, they lacked access to a consistent supply of nutritious food to lead healthy, active lives.
<h4>The Consequences of Food Insecurity for Seniors</h4>
Younger people may have an easier time overcoming poor nutrition. Seniors, however, are not so lucky. If a senior suffers from food insecurity, they can face longer recovery times after surgery. It may also take their bodies more time to heal any wounds from falls.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Speaking of falls, food-insecure seniors are at a higher risk since insufficient nutrition can lead to bone density, muscle mass, and balance issues. If a senior is at a higher risk for falls, it can negatively impact their independence.

A lack of nutrients due to food insecurity can also leave a senior with nutrient deficiencies. This can result in chronic conditions. Add in financial problems and the stress from not putting food on the table, and those chronic conditions can become even worse.

With an adequate diet, seniors can reduce stress, decrease the risk of chronic conditions, maintain healthier bodies, and hang on to their independence. Where can this adequate diet come from if an older adult lacks income? From SNAP or food stamps.
<h4>How SNAP Improves Senior Health</h4>
As of 2016, the USDA estimated that nearly five million low-income seniors over 60 were SNAP recipients. On average, they received $106 monthly to buy groceries. This resulted in a 30 percent reduction in food insecurity.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

What happens when a senior becomes eligible for SNAP benefits? Besides gaining peace of mind knowing they’re getting a certain amount each month for groceries, studies found that SNAP allowed them to save money for other expenses.

One of the most prominent findings was how SNAP helped seniors stick to their prescriptions. A 2018 study found that seniors were less likely to miss doses of medication by receiving food stamps, and they were more likely to refill prescriptions.

As a senior’s monthly SNAP budget increased, they began using their extra savings to pay for medical care and activities to promote their health. According to a study by the University of Massachusetts Boston, SNAP beneficiaries over 60 were more likely to access health care. Using their savings towards hospital stays, doctor appointments, home health care, and nursing home care, seniors receiving SNAP had a better chance of living longer, healthier lives.

While SNAP frees up money for seniors to access healthcare, it also makes them less likely to need it. Seniors who participate in SNAP have a lower risk of hospitalization, and those who visit the hospital usually do so for shorter, less expensive stays.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

<h4>Applying for SNAP</h4>
Although the benefits of SNAP for seniors are promising, it’s unfortunate that many are not taking advantage of the program. According to the National Council on Aging, nearly three in five seniors are eligible for SNAP, but have not applied to receive the benefits.

What do we all need to survive? Some will chime in by saying that housing is a must. Meanwhile, others will list food first, which is a good idea, because without it, we’d pass quite quickly.

It’s unfortunate, but many people lack the income necessary to keep putting their own food on the table. To tackle this issue, the government has come up with several programs that offer food assistance. And to help you learn more about what’s available, we put together these guides:

If you have kids of school age, you can get help with breakfast and lunch to cut your costs.
You can even get help during the summer when they’re out of school.

3771,"3 Ways To Make An Extra $500 This Month","[the_ad_group id=""174""]<!-- Loan Offers -->

What could you do with an extra $500 per month? You could use it to move to a better home that’s more spacious or in a better neighborhood. $500 could help you upgrade your car to something newer and more dependable.

You could also use that extra monthly money to pay down debt. Or you could use it to build up an emergency fund to avoid debt should a rainy day appear.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

Regardless of what you’d use that extra $500 per month on, you’re probably wondering how to make that additional income. Luckily, you don’t need to get a second time-consuming job to achieve this goal, as here are other ways to make it happen:
<h4>1. Sell what you don’t need.</h4>
Did you know that a little “spring cleaning” could be highly profitable? By decluttering your home and getting rid of what you don’t need, you could easily rake in $500 this month by selling your used items to others online.

Start with your closets, and pick out any clothes you no longer wear. Then start looking at your electronics, furniture, etc., to see if there are things you’d like to get rid of.

Once you have everything put to the side, it’s time to sell it on the Internet. Some of your best options are sites like Poshmark for clothes, Craigslist if you’d like to sell locally without shipping, and eBay to find buyers worldwide.

[the_ad_group id=""173""]<!-- Resources-->

When posting your items online, be sure to take plenty of pictures from various angles to showcase their condition. Also, don’t forget to make in-depth descriptions to entice buyers to make that purchase. By putting in a little extra work while posting, you can sell your things more quickly and for a higher price.
<h4>2. Rent out extra space.</h4>
Have your kids recently moved out? Do you have more home than you need? If you answered yes to either question, you could use that extra space to bring in additional cash.

Airbnb and VRBO are popular sites for renting out rooms or entire properties to people seeking short-term options. You could also use a site like Stache to rent out garage space or even a parking space. According to Stache, many of their users make an extra $6,000 per year by making this very simple move.
<h4>3. Find some side gigs.</h4>
There are plenty of sites that offer side gigs that you can easily convert into cash without the commitment that comes with an actual job.

[the_ad id=""2908""]<!-- AdSense -->

What’s the best part about side gigs? Besides the extra cash they can bring in with no commitment necessary, it’s the fact that many don’t require experience. In other words, you can start looking for side gigs today, get hired, do the gig, and get paid without worry.

Some popular places to find side gigs online include Craigslist, Taskrabbit, Freelancer, Fiverr, and FlexJobs. The more sites you browse, the more gigs you’ll find. And the more gigs you find and complete, the more you’ll pad your bank account.","If you’re looking for ways to pad your bank account with $500 or more that don’t involve working extra hours or getting a second job, here they are.","2020-12-17 19:04:21",post,https://holidayrelief.com/3-ways-to-make-an-extra-500-this-month/,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1737703751.jpg,shutterstock_1737703751.jpg,/chroot/home/a628562e/holidayrelief.com/html/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1737703751.jpg,3772,shutterstock_1737703751,,,,https://holidayrelief.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1737703751.jpg,"Work From Home",,publish,1,hr_admin,rontest1984@gmail.com,Jonah,Jacobs,3-ways-to-make-an-extra-500-this-month,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-01-19 17:58:25"
